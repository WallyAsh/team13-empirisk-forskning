        "full_text": "The announcement by the new Donald Trump administration to suspend foreign aid spending — approximately $68 billion annually — has sent shock waves across the world. This decision will not only affect military aid, which makes up a large percentage of the total, but also threatens funding for development aid, human rights campaigns, and initiatives that support democratic institutions — even as US foreign policy tends to undermine the stated goals of its aid. The executive order immediately raised concerns in the mainstream press about the United States neglecting its duty to Ukraine in its war with Russia and the abandonment of numerous humanitarian missions across the underdeveloped world.\n\nThe general response to this announcement, however, reinforces a long-standing false dichotomy: the notion that US and Western humanitarian and developmental interventionism operates independently of these nations’ broader, overtly aggressive geopolitical and imperialist interests. In this context, President Trump’s announcement should not be seen as an attack on the “friendlier” side of US foreign policy but rather an alignment of its outward form with its substance, unveiling the true purpose of foreign aid in serving US ruling-class interests — now all stick and no carrot.\n\nUSAID and NGOism\n\nAlongside overt forms of domination — military interventions, territorial acquisition, direct political interference — Western powers have long developed parallel forms of intervention and control, sometimes called informal imperialism. Over the last few decades, a refinement and perfecting of these more subtle instruments of domination has sometimes partially displaced older forms. Due to its proximity to the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean have been important testing grounds for these practices.\n\nHistorically, these have involved policies such as promoting US ideology and culture with Christian missions or Hollywood blockbusters (the softest of soft imperialism), subordinating governments by covertly financing opposition political parties or presidential candidates, and the use of economic sanctions. The region has also witnessed an increasing reliance on developmental aid programs, a trend that can be traced to the advent of so-called multilateral aid initiatives led by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the mid-twentieth century. These organizations and initiatives were later used to compel nations in the Global South to adopt neoliberal policies, reinforcing their dependency on the United States and Europe.\n\nThis form of imperialism has empowered so-called civil society — nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and civil society organizations (CSOs) — in the peripheralized regions. Among them are groups concerned with poverty and inequality, human rights, and, increasingly, the ecological crisis whose humanitarian interventions have often coincided with and even legitimated neoliberal reforms.\n\nInstrumental to the mushrooming of these organizations have been Western developmental agencies — most notably, the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the World Bank, and, more recently, the European Union’s numerous developmental aid programs. The latter actor has used the region as a testing ground for its “civilian power” approach to foreign policy since the late 1990s.\n\nThese Western developmental aid and humanitarian programs are not only fundamentally incapable of addressing the region’s severe social and ecological crises; they have also served as tools to reinforce the very structures that perpetuate these problems. Nearly a century into this model of interventionism, the historical conditions of poverty, inequality, exploitation, and oppression — the very issues these programs aim to resolve — remain intact even as new markets have been wrenched open.\n\nThe Early Laboratories of Civil Society\n\nLike neoliberalism itself, much of this began in earnest in Chile. The US-backed military coup that overthrew the country’s socialist government in 1973 was the culmination of a more comprehensive foreign intervention that had started years earlier. Thousands of documents declassified by the US government between 1999 and 2000 confirmed the CIA’s involvement. The economic war and the military coup were the culmination of a broader effort, going as far back as the early 1960s, to keep Chile’s socialists out of power. Central to this effort was the funding and influencing of civil society groups such as trade unions, religious groups, and women’s organizations.\n\nWith Augusto Pinochet’s installation as dictator, Chile not only became a laboratory for neoliberal policies but also an important site for the deployment and development of Western-backed NGOs, particularly human rights ones. In other words, at the same time as the United States and Europe backed and facilitated Chile’s dictatorship and the brutal oppression of its population, they also played a role in its partial relief, funding human rights NGOs that performed roles as varied as denouncing the dictatorship’s abuses and providing meals for impoverished families.\n\nAs highlighted by James Petras in his extensive research on the matter, the growth of Western-backed NGOs in Latin America and the Caribbean coincided with Operation Condor, a campaign of terror against leftist leaders and movements and the installment of US-backed regimes beginning in the 1970s. By superficially alleviating some of the more obvious fallout from the installation of repressive regimes and the neoliberal economic policies they immediately adopted, these civil society organizations played the complementary role of neutralizing more organic and radical political and social movements, co-opting or weakening them and their leadership with the vast resources at their disposal.\n\nWith more significant funding from multilateral organizations like the World Bank beginning in the 1980s and, notably, from USAID and European developmental programs since the turn of the twenty-first century, these civil society groups have reproduced themselves across the region and become crucial to Western foreign policy.\n\nDemocracy According to USAID\n\nBy the 1990s, with the region’s leftist movement weakened in the aftermath of Operation Condor and former dictatorships transitioning back to electoral democracies, the West’s focus in Latin America shifted from NGOs concerned with human rights abuses to those promoting democracy and development, with the former cause increasingly integrated into the latter.\n\nOperating in the region since its founding in the early 1960s, USAID took a stronger role in the 1990s as the friendly side of US interventionism. It poured hundreds of millions of dollars into Haiti for NGO initiatives and state-led “democratic” programs, financed microdevelopment projects in rural Paraguay to dissuade peasants from supporting insurgent groups, and countered the rapidly growing socialist movement in Bolivia through a multimillion-dollar democracy-building campaign.\n\nThis multifaceted approach to sustaining US hegemony in the region would eventually be joined and, in some countries, rivaled by other Western powers. From the early 2000s, the European Union began testing its novel civil society approach to foreign policy in war-ridden Colombia, proposing an alternative to the US-backed Plan Colombia, a hawkish counterinsurgent policy and corollary to the domestic US “war on drugs.”\n\nBut the EU’s so-called Peace Laboratories, receiving tens of millions of euros between 2002 and 2010, would, in fact, be implemented in Colombia alongside the counterinsurgency program, contributing to the weakening of revolutionary left-wing movements and their social base through, among other things, financing microdevelopmental projects that tied peasants in conflict areas to the agricultural exports industry. Moreover, as the Campaign Against Arms Trade highlighted, EU member states like the UK (then still part of the EU) and Spain contributed directly to the US-backed militarist efforts to subdue the population at the same time as the peacebuilding project.\n\nAs the United States made massive military transfers to Colombia, the EU surpassed it as the principal donor of developmental aid to Latin America and the Caribbean in the early 2000s. This developmental investment was accompanied by the intensification of trade between Latin America and Europe, which today approaches the region’s trade with the United States, facilitated further by several bloc-to-bloc free trade agreements, all of them containing normative clauses and conditions.\n\nThough firmly aligned with violent, militaristic forms of intervention, European Union aid, USAID, and other such developmental agencies have worked in the region with relatively little scrutiny or opposition. This is largely due to the widespread assumption that their projects are inherently benevolent and a force for good.\n\nThis can be observed today in USAID’s continued allocation of millions of dollars to the region, most recently under the guise of aiding Venezuela’s migrants. It is also reflected in the World Bank’s annual loans, amounting to the tens of billions for so-called “sustainable” development programs, and the European Union’s yearly contribution of one hundred million euros in humanitarian aid — dwarfed by the approximate three hundred billion euros in goods traded annually between the EU and Latin America.\n\nImperialism Was Never Friendly\n\nThe contemporary practice of informal imperialism — of developmental aid and humanitarianism specifically — has become the favored form of tapping into new markets and maintaining favorable conditions for investment in the Global South. In this regard, the Western aid and NGO project in Latin America and the Caribbean has mostly been a success story.\n\nHow permanent the Trump administration’s pause in aid becomes remains to be seen. Either way, the change in foreign policy will likely face significant resistance among both state actors and capital, as such soft power has proven an effective tool in furthering imperial and ruling-class interests. For the rest of us, these troubling times present an opportunity to focus on those interests and how they’re advanced across administrations and policy regimes. This means unmasking the illusion of friendly US and European foreign policy and challenging its contempt for the world’s oppressed majorities not only when displayed openly but also when carefully concealed behind a facade of humanitarian benevolence.",

        "full_text": "Employees of the Hungarian radio station Klubradio work at its headquarters in Budapest, Hungary, February 6, 2025. REUTERS/Bernadett Szabo Employees of the Hungarian radio station Klubradio work at its headquarters in Budapest, Hungary, February 6, 2025. REUTERS/Bernadett Szabo , Summary USAID has helped fund independent media in eastern Europe Many outlets reeling from Trump actions against USAID They say loss of funds hits ability to hold power to account Hungary, Bosnia, Georgia among countries most impacted BUDAPEST/SARAJEVO, Feb 13 (Reuters) - At a Feb. 10 editorial meeting of Hungarian investigative outlet Atlatszo, journalists discussed how they might raise money after their grants from USAID intermediaries were halted amid U.S. President Donald Trump's drive to shutter the agency. \"Without these funds it would be very hard to maintain independent media here (in Hungary),\" Atlatszo's managing editor Tamas Bodoky told Reuters, adding that they would seek new donors and try to increase crowdfunding. Atlatszo, a non-profit outlet set up in 2011, has published investigations on corruption, Hungarian oligarchs close to the government and the fate of EU funds, among other issues. Bodoky said USAID indirectly financed some 10-15% of its budget in 2023 and 2024. Trump's decision - first to freeze most funds disbursed by USAID for 90 days and put most of its staff on leave and then to ask billionaire Elon Musk to scale down the agency - has caused chaos for NGOs and humanitarian projects worldwide. While the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) distributes billions of dollars of humanitarian aid, it has also been involved in many other projects, including those aimed at strengthening civil society and democracy worldwide. USAID opened , new programmes in central Europe in late 2022, supporting locally-driven initiatives to bolster democratic institutions and independent media - much to the chagrin of Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a Trump ally who has welcomed the U.S. president's moves against the agency. Although the ultimate fate of many USAID programmes remains uncertain, the Trump administration has indicated it does not see supporting journalism in countries where rights groups say press freedom is limited as a good use of U.S. public funds. \"The US radical-left has been using US taxpayer money to fund radical-left political parties & media around the world,” Musk wrote on X on January 29. Both Musk and Trump have branded USAID as \"corrupt\", without providing evidence. Trump's moves against USAID prompted Orban to say on February 7 that he wants to eliminate all \"foreign networks\" of NGOs and media critical of his government, fuelling fears that it will embolden him and other illiberal governments to enact clampdowns on media they deem to be unfriendly. \"Money from abroad cannot be allowed to influence Hungarian politics, and we shall enforce this legally, with those who are complicit in this facing legal consequences,\" said Orban, who faces a challenging election in 2026 amid a struggling economy. Orban has transformed Hungary's media landscape over the past 14 years. State media have been put under full government control and several private media outlets shut or taken over by government-friendly owners. Tight media control has helped Orban win the past three elections with a landslide. PRESS FREEDOM In 2024, Hungary ranked 67th on the World Press Freedom Index , , down from 23rd in 2010 when Orban took power, with its ranking well below that of Poland or the Czech Republic. Georgia and Bosnia - two other eastern European countries heavily impacted by Trump's efforts to dismantle USAID - ranked 103rd and 81st, respectively, for press freedom last year. The Sarajevo-based \"Umbrella\" association, a hub for 13 non-profit media involved in investigative journalism in the Balkans, is among organisations waiting to know if USAID donations will resume after Trump's 90-day financing freeze. \"If U.S. donations to media in Bosnia and Herzegovina were to be halted (permanently), some of them would be forced to reduce the scope of their work... cutting the number of serious stories about corruption, organised crime and abuse of power,\" said Umbrella director Milica Samardzic. Paulina Milewska, a researcher for the European University Institute in Florence, Italy, also cited the risk that media outlets that lose USAID funding will need to cut back on deeper coverage. While the U.S. government has long helped fund media organisations all over the world, eastern Europe has always been a major focus dating back to the Cold War, when the CIA helped establish outlets to sway public opinion against communism. Musk called on February 9 for the closure of Radio Free Europe (RFE) – which has been funded by U.S. government money separate to USAID since 1950 – saying it was a \"relic of the past\". In an emailed reply to Reuters, RFE declined to comment. After the USAID freeze, the European Federation of Journalists (EFJ) called on European institutions and foundations , to mobilise in support of media pluralism and independent journalism, saying Trump's move would cause \"chaos in the media ecosystem of over 30 countries around the world, including many European countries\". These include Georgia, where tens of thousands of people have been protesting for months against a government they see as pro-Russian and authoritarian and which has suspended negotiations to join the European Union. Among media outlets there affected by Trump's decision is English language news site OC-Media, which said it had lost funding for three USAID-backed projects. \"Without independent journalism, there will be no one to hold power to account,\" said its co-founder, Dominik Cagara.

        "full_text": "Fired USAid employees and advocates for people with HIV staged a protest in a Capitol office building on Wednesday, warning that Donald Trump’s drive to dismantle the agency tasked with implementing Washington’s foreign aid agenda imperils the fight against the virus.\n\nWearing white T-shirts that read “Aids funding cuts kill” and chanting “Congress has blood on its hands, unfreeze aid now”, around three dozen protesters lay down in the rotunda of the Cannon House office building, home to the offices of representatives from both parties. Capitol police said about 20 arrests were made of demonstrators who defied their orders to disperse.\n\n“What we are demanding of Congress is that they stop behaving like doormats in the face of this attack on humanitarian assistance that truly is highly effective and life-saving,” Asia Russell, executive director of Health Gap, a global advocacy group fighting against HIV, said prior to the protest.\n\n“It’s very hard to overstate what’s at stake regarding humanitarian assistance.”\n\nThe protest came as USAid remained frozen by the Trump administration’s rapid moves to close the agency. Over the weekend, the agency announced that it was placing all but a small number of its employees worldwide, as well as nearly 2,000 staffers based in the United States, on paid leave. Those working in Washington DC have been invited to retrieve their belongings from its headquarters, which is set to be turned into office space for US Customs and Border Protection, one of the agencies implementing Trump’s hardline immigration policies.\n\nOn Tuesday, a federal judge reportedly gave the government a two-day deadline to release billions of dollars in foreign aid funds that had been held back after Trump ordered USAid to stop work. If those funds are not restored, former USAid employees who attended the protest at the Capitol warned, the global fight against HIV will be set back.\n\nThe United States has been a leader in the campaign against the virus that causes Aids through Pepfar, a program that provides medication to 20 million people worldwide and was established during Republican George W Bush’s presidency. But USAid’s abrupt closure has stopped payments to providers working with the program worldwide.\n\n“This is not controversial, and what is happening is not government efficiency, it’s government fraud, waste and abuse when it comes to what Doge is doing,” said the fired USAid contractor Van Credle, referring to Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency”, which spearheaded the dismantling of her agency as well as other deep cuts to federal services.\n\nThe Republican majorities elected to both the Senate and House last November have thus far shown little interest in saving USAid and even supported its closure, despite the fact that foreign assistance has in the past enjoyed support on both sides of the aisle. Kelsey Crow, a contractor at the agency’s bureau of global health who lost her job, said the protest was meant to encourage lawmakers who previously supported USAid to step up.\n\n“So much of our work at USAid is mandated by Congress, and so for Congress to not be taking action, for Congress to be holding hearings that are pushing out lies and falsehoods about USAid to say that the waivers are back when we know that they’re actually not turned on and the money’s not actually flowing, it’s incredibly disappointing,” Crow said.\n\nPeter Kerndt, a physician who spent five years with USAid coordinating the fight against tuberculosis in African and Asian countries, said it will be “impossible” to achieve a global goal of eliminating the virus by 2030 if the agency goes away.\n\n“For this administration, for Elon Musk to call USAid a criminal organization that should die and to gleefully celebrate that he spent the weekend putting USAid in the wood chipper instead of going to a party is such an insult to all of the workers, both here and in the country,” he said. “But most of all, the people that suffer are the people that we were there to help.”\n\nAndrew Roth contributed reporting",

        "full_text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration said it is eliminating more than 90% of the U.S. Agency for International Development’s foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall U.S. assistance around the world, putting numbers on its plans to eliminate the majority of U.S. development and humanitarian help abroad.\n\nThe cuts detailed by the administration would leave few surviving USAID projects for advocates to try to save in what are ongoing court battles with the administration.\n\nThe Trump administration outlined its plans in both an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press and filings in one of those federal lawsuits Wednesday.\n\nThe Supreme Court intervened in that case late Wednesday and temporarily blocked a court order requiring the administration to release billions of dollars in foreign aid by midnight.\n\nWednesday’s disclosures also give an idea of the scale of the administration’s retreat from U.S. aid and development assistance overseas, and from decades of U.S. policy that foreign aid helps U.S. interests by stabilizing other countries and economies and building alliances.\n\nThe memo said officials were “clearing significant waste stemming from decades of institutional drift.” More changes are planned in how USAID and the State Department deliver foreign assistance, it said, “to use taxpayer dollars wisely to advance American interests.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump and ally Elon Musk have hit foreign aid harder and faster than almost any other target in their push to cut the size of the federal government. Both men say USAID projects advance a liberal agenda and are a waste of money.\n\nTrump on Jan. 20 ordered what he said would be a 90-day program-by-program review of which foreign assistance programs deserved to continue, and cut off all foreign assistance funds almost overnight.\n\nThe funding freeze has stopped thousands of U.S.-funded programs abroad, and the administration and Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency teams have pulled the majority of USAID staff off the job through forced leave and firings.\n\nWidely successful USAID programs credited with containing outbreaks of Ebola and other threats and saving more than 20 million lives in Africa through HIV and AIDS treatment are among those still cut off from agency funds, USAID officials and officials with partner organizations say. Meanwhile, formal notifications of program cancellations are rolling out.\n\nIn the federal court filings Wednesday, nonprofits owed money on contracts with USAID describe both Trump political appointees and members of Musk’s teams terminating USAID’s contracts around the world at breakneck speed, without time for any meaningful review, they say.\n\n“‘There are MANY more terminations coming, so please gear up!’'' a USAID official wrote staff Monday, in an email quoted by lawyers for the nonprofits in the filings.\n\nThe nonprofits, among thousands of contractors, owed billions of dollars in payment since the freeze began, called the en masse contract terminations a maneuver to get around complying with the order to lift the funding freeze temporarily.\n\nSo did a Democratic lawmaker.\n\nThe administration was attempting to “blow through Congress and the courts by announcing the completion of their sham ‘review’ of foreign aid and the immediate termination of thousands of aid programs all over the world,” said Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nA coalition representing major U.S. and global businesses and nongovernmental organizations and former officials expressed shock at the move. “The American people deserve a transparent accounting of what will be lost — on counterterror, global health, food security, and competition,” the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition said.\n\nThe State Department said Secretary of State Marco Rubio had reviewed the terminations.\n\nIn all, the Trump administration said it will eliminate 5,800 of 6,200 multiyear USAID contract awards, for a cut of $54 billion. Another 4,100 of 9,100 State Department grants were being eliminated, for a cut of $4.4 billion.\n\nThe State Department memo, which was first reported by the Washington Free Beacon, described the administration as spurred by a federal court order that gave officials until the end of the day Wednesday to lift the Trump administration’s monthlong block on foreign aid funding.\n\n“In response, State and USAID moved rapidly,” targeting USAID and State Department foreign aid programs in vast numbers for contract terminations, the memo said.\n\nTrump administration officials — after repeated warnings from the federal judge in the case — also said Wednesday they were finally beginning to send out their first or any payments after more than a month with no known spending. Officials were processing a few million dollars of back payments, officials said, owed to U.S. and international organizations and companies.\n\nBut U.S. District Judge Amir H. Ali’s order to unfreeze billions of dollars by midnight Wednesday will remain on hold until the Supreme Court has a chance to weigh in more fully, according to the brief order signed by Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nAli had ordered the federal government to comply with his decision temporarily blocking a freeze on foreign aid, ruling in a lawsuit filed by nonprofit groups and businesses. An appellate panel refused the administration’s request to intervene before the high court weighed in.\n\nThe plaintiffs have until noon Friday to respond, Roberts said.\n\nThe administration has filed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court in one other case so far, arguing that a lower court was wrong to reinstate the head of a federal watchdog agency after Trump fired him.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Gary Fields in Washington and Rebecca Boone in Boise, Idaho, contributed to this report.",

        "full_text": "Like a child custody battle in a throuple, U.S. tech companies are getting pulled in three directions as the Trump administration abandons its predecessor's tacit tolerance, if not always explicit approval, for official censorship in the European Union and Brazil.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission joined the Federal Communications Commission in pressuring Big Tech to back off content moderation that allegedly suppresses conservative speech and challenges to establishment narratives compared to other speech, an evolution of the agencies' history of turf wars on internet policy issues.\n\nPresident Trump issued another sweeping executive order Friday that includes investigating and countering U.K. and EU policies that may have \"the effect of requiring or incentivizing the use or development\" of U.S.-made products and services \"in ways that undermine freedom of speech and political engagement or otherwise moderate content.\"\n\nTrump Media and Technology Group, home of the president's Truth Social, and video platform Rumble also got a reprieve from a federal court in their lawsuit against Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes for his censorship orders.\n\nU.S. District Judge Mary Scriven, nominated by President George W. Bush, ruled that Moraes didn't follow the Hague Convention or the countries' Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty in issuing his orders, so the plaintiffs didn't need a temporary restraining order to stop him.\n\n\"Censorship by technology platforms is not just un-American, it is potentially illegal,\" the FTC said, issuing a request for information that seeks public comment on consumer harm from \"potentially unfair or deceptive acts or practices, or potentially unfair methods of competition,\" and specifically input from \"current and former employees of technology platforms.\"\n\nIt asks for circumstances under which platforms have shadowbanned and demonetized users based on their speech and affiliations, what their \"public-facing representations\" said about moderation and whether users could appeal sanctions, what influenced such adverse actions and how they may have been enabled by lack of competition or weakened competition.\n\n\"Tech firms should not be bullying their users\" into silencing themselves based on viewpoint, said FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson, who was first appointed to the commission by President Biden and confirmed by the Senate less than a year ago.\n\nRoughly 1,000 comments had already been filed by Wednesday afternoon in a proceeding that runs through May 21, many without real names and either critical of the proceeding or implying President Trump and X owner Elon Musk are the real threat to free speech.\n\n\"The Trumpsters are censoring our ability to say Gulf of Mexico, he//him, etc.,\" commenter \"Andrew Ferguson\" wrote, referring to Trump's tiff with the Associated Press over the renamed \"Gulf of America\" and reported ban on federal employees listing their gender pronouns.\n\nIt appears to be the Trump FTC's first confirmed shot across the bow at Big Tech, arriving late to the party started by cell tower-climbing FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, dubbed a Trump \"sycophant\" by House Judiciary Committee Ranking Democrat Jamie Raskin for reinstating complaints against broadcast networks for their election coverage decisions including editing.\n\nLess than two weeks after the election, Trump-nominated Commissioner Carr said the \"censorship cartel\" that silenced Americans, with help from an \"Orwellian\" purported fact-checker, \"must be dismantled and destroyed.\"\n\nIn letters to Google and Facebook parent companies as well as Microsoft and Apple, Carr said their work with NewsGuard, a rating system for news and information websites, might not be in \"good faith,\" the condition for legal immunity under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.\n\nApple also has to fend off increasing attacks from conservative rabble-rousers.\n\nIt defeated four resolutions at its annual shareholder meeting this week including transparency on how it fights child sexual abuse material and its relationships with activists such as the Human Rights Campaign, which requires companies to pay for so-called gender affirming care for minors to perform well on its Corporate Equality Index.\n\nThe Alliance Defending Freedom, which helped lead the shareholder efforts, called it a win because \"this is the beginning of a conversation,\" in the words of Senior Vice President of corporate engagement Jeremy Tedesco.\n\n\"Apple has budged\" in response to their resolution against diversity, equity and inclusion \"and I think there's more budging to be done,\" Bowyer Research President Jerry Bowyer said, noting that Apple CEO Tim Cook suggested that legal changes may force it to recant DEI.\n\nThe FCC's Carr is a long-term skeptic of the breadth of Section 230 immunity as determined by courts, cheering President Biden's interest in \"removing Big Tech’s special Section 230 protections\" in 2022 while suggesting ways to avoid \"encouraging even more censorship.\"\n\nNew York Post business columnist Charles Gasparino said investors should prepare for Big Tech stocks tanking if Carr's \"inchoate\" plan for Section 230 regulatory review gets fleshed out as an advisory opinion that weakens or eliminates the liability shield on the grounds that platforms are no longer \"blind arbiter[s] of information.\"\n\nGasparino sees a \"good chance\" many courts, especially with conservative jurists, will rely on FCC guidance in Section 230 cases, giving new life to defamation claims against Big Tech, granting expensive legal discovery and prompting settlements.\n\nThe columnist buttressed his take by pointing to Section 230 caselaw in Silicon Valley's 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which most recently stripped immunity from Facebook in a class-action lawsuit against its algorithm discerning users' protected characteristics and letting advertisers discriminate in whom they target with housing ads based on those characteristics.\n\nCarr confirmed Big Tech scrutiny will be a hallmark of his chairmanship by hiring law professor Adam Candeub, long a vocal critic of Section 230 as interpreted by courts, as general counsel of the agency, the position Carr held before his elevation to commissioner.\n\nCarr also praised Trump's nomination of ex-FTC lawyer Gail Slater, onetime policy chief for the since-disbanded Internet Association, as Justice Department antitrust division chief, who will \"help rein in Big Tech and put an end to their abusive and anticompetitive practices.\"\n\nThe FTC and DOJ have their own history of turf wars, and Ferguson told staff last week he wanted the two \"singing from the same song sheet\" when it comes to merger reviews. He said it's better to keep the Biden administration's joint 2023 guidelines rather than spark a \"recriminatory cycle of partisan rescissions\" that harm business and confuse courts.\n\nThe first-month moves by the Trump-appointed chairmen coincide with the president's Feb. 18 executive order to exert more control over the FTC, FCC and Securities and Exchange Commission, which the order calls \"so-called independent agencies\" whose economy-straining rules and regulations have long escaped direct presidential review.",

        "full_text": "Summary Plaintiffs say Trump actions violate US law, Constitution Administration had asked US Supreme Court to intervene WASHINGTON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on Wednesday paused a federal judge's order requiring President Donald Trump 's administration to pay foreign aid funds to contractors and grant recipients. Roberts issued an interim order placing on hold Washington-based U.S. District Judge Amir Ali's action that had imposed a deadline of 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday night. Roberts provided no rationale for the order, known as an administrative stay, which will give the court additional time to consider the administration's more formal request to block Ali's ruling. Roberts asked for a response from the plaintiffs - organizations that contract with or receive grants from the U.S. Agency for International Development and the State Department - by noon on Friday. The order came after Trump's administration said in a court filing on Wednesday it had made final decisions terminating most U.S. foreign aid contracts and grants, while maintaining that it cannot meet Ali's court-ordered deadline. The administration is cutting more than 90% of the U.S. Agency for International Development's foreign aid contracts and over $58 billion in overall U.S. assistance around the world, a State Department spokesperson said separately, calling the cuts part of Trump's \"America First agenda.\" The foreign aid funding dispute arose from a pair of lawsuits brought by the aid organizations, alleging that the agencies have illegally frozen all foreign aid payments. The Trump administration has kept those payments largely frozen despite a February 13 temporary restraining order from Ali that they be released, and multiple subsequent orders that the administration comply, culminating in the Wednesday night deadline. Lawyers for the U.S. Justice Department have maintained that the administration has a right to suspend its agreements while it reviews them to determine whether they comply with administration policy. That review is now complete, the administration said in its new filing. It said USAID has made final decisions to cancel nearly 5,800 awards, while keeping more than 500, and that the State Department has canceled about 4,100 awards, while keeping about 2,700. An administration official said in an earlier court filing that grounds for terminating contracts include that they were related to diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility efforts, or were deemed wasteful. Trump has taken a hard line on programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion, signing an executive order in his second day in office last month directing federal agency chiefs to dismantle DEI policies . An American flag and USAID flag fly outside the USAID building in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 1, 2025. REUTERS/Annabelle Gordon/File Photo , The administration said on Wednesday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had ordered that past-due invoices from the plaintiffs for work before January 24, when the payment freeze began, to be \"expedited for payment without the ordinary vetting procedures, in a good-faith effort to comply\" with Ali's order. It said that while some money would be paid on Wednesday, full payments could take weeks. FUNDING FREEZE UNDERMINES RELIEF EFFORTS Trump, a Republican, ordered a 90-day pause on all foreign aid on his first day in office last month. That order, and ensuing stop-work orders halting USAID operations around the world, have jeopardized the delivery of life-saving food and medical aid, throwing global humanitarian relief efforts into chaos . USAID administers some 60% of U.S. foreign assistance and disbursed $43.79 billion in fiscal 2023. According to a Congressional Research Service report this month, its workforce of 10,000, of which about two-thirds serves overseas, assisted about 130 countries. Trump's administration on Sunday said it was placing all but leaders and critical staff at USAID on paid administrative leave and eliminating 1,600 positions . Employee unions have sued to challenge the cuts, though a judge last week allowed them to go ahead . Ali, who was appointed by Trump's Democratic predecessor, former President Joe Biden, issued his temporary restraining order to prevent irreparable harm to the plaintiffs while he considers their claims. The plaintiffs allege Trump has exceeded his authority under federal law and the U.S. Constitution by effectively dismantling an independent agency and canceling spending authorized by Congress. The plaintiffs have said the administration has not done anything to comply with the restraining order, and some have said they will shut down within days if they are not paid. \"The lengths that the government is willing to go to flout a court order, all for the goal of ending life-saving humanitarian assistance, is staggering,\" said Allison Zieve, a lawyer representing two plaintiffs, AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and Journalism Development Network, on Wednesday. Other plaintiffs include international development company DAI Global and refugee assistance organization HIAS. Both Ali and a Rhode Island federal judge in a separate case over a broader federal payment freeze have castigated the Trump administration for failing to follow their orders. The administration in both cases has maintained it is trying in good faith to interpret and comply with the orders.

        "full_text": "U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose 25% tariffs on imports from the European Union, claiming that the economic and political bloc was formed \"to screw\" the U.S.\n\nThe White House leader signaled the potential trade measures on Wednesday, during the first Cabinet meeting of his second term in office — a day before he announced that another set of proposed levies on Mexico and Canada will go into effect on March 4, noting that China will be charged an additional 10% tariff on the same date.\n\n\"We'll be announcing it very soon,\" he told reporters of the EU measures on Wednesday. \"It'll be [a] 25% [tariff] generally speaking, and that will be on cars and all other things.\"\n\nHe added, \"They've really taken advantage of us ... They don't accept our cars, they don't accept, essentially, our farm products. They use all sorts of reasons why not. And we accept everything of them.\"\n\nThe president has made it a priority to tackle what he sees as unfair trade relationships with a number of the U.S.' closest neighbors and trading partners, citing the U.S.' persistent trade deficits — in which it imports more goods and services than it exports — as evidence of this.\n\nTrump claimed, without citing evidence, that the EU had been formed to undermine the U.S.\n\n\"I love the countries of Europe. I guess I'm from there at some point, a long time ago, right? ... But [the] European Union was formed in order to screw the United States ... that's the purpose of it, and they've done a good job of it. But now I'm president,\" he said.\n\nThe EU was established after the 1993 enforcement of the Maastricht Treaty, building on post-war sentiment of European unity and cites establishing an internal market and achieving sustainable development among its aims.\n\nReacting to Trump's claims about the EU's origin, the Commission noted that the EU had benefitted the U.S.\n\n\"The European Union is the world's largest free market. And it has been a boon for the United States. By creating a large and integrated single market, the EU has facilitated trade, reduced costs for U.S. exporters, and harmonized standards and regulations across 27 countries. As a result, U.S. investments in Europe are highly profitable,\" the Commission said in a statement to CNBC.\n\nThe EU urged the U.S. to work with it \"to preserve these opportunities for our people and businesses. Not against each other.\"\n\nThe tariffs prospect is not new, with Trump having already threatened the EU and U.K. with levies. The White House leader had nevertheless previously signaled that a deal could be worked out with Britain, which has a much more balanced trading relationship with the U.S.\n\n— CNBC's Silvia Amaro contributed reporting to this story.",

        "full_text": "The U.S. Justice Department told Congress in November that there were no major disputes with the United Kingdom over how the two allies seek data from each other’s communication companies.\n\nBut at that time, officials knew British authorities were preparing a demand that Apple build a back door to its users’ encrypted data, according to people familiar with the process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal department matters.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on Tuesday called that British demand an “egregious” violation of American rights, and on Wednesday lawmakers asked the Justice Department to investigate.\n\nNovember’s report to Congress was required by law to renew an agreement that lets the U.K. obtain electronic data from U.S. providers without going through U.S. courts. In it, the Biden Justice Department certified that U.K. laws and procedures provided “robust substantive and procedural protections for privacy and civil liberties.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSen. Alex Padilla and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, both California Democrats, asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to reexamine that finding, saying Britain’s threat to compromise encryption violated the information-sharing deal between the two countries under the 2018 Cloud Act.\n\n“No entity, foreign or domestic, should be able to make Americans’ data more susceptible to breaches,” Padilla said. “That’s why we are demanding accountability, not just from other countries, but from the Department of Justice, which has the responsibility to keep Americans’ data safe — we must not set this terrible precedent.”\n\nThe U.K. ordered Apple in January to create a way for British authorities to obtain content that Apple users store in iCloud with Advanced Data Protection, an encryption option rolled out worldwide two years ago. That content is end-to-end encrypted, meaning only the user, and not Apple, can access it. Apple withdrew the encryption option in the U.K. on Friday rather than comply, an action that would have left its users with less security than they had been promised.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Justice Department’s 10-page report to the Foreign Relations and Judiciary committees of the House and Senate noted that unnamed U.S. companies had complained that the U.K. Investigatory Powers Act required advance notice if they wanted to enhance privacy or security in their services and that Britain could then block those offerings globally.\n\nThe department said it reminded its British counterpart of the Cloud Act’s “requirement that the terms of the Agreement shall not create any obligation that providers be capable of decrypting data.” The report did not mention the looming order, and said any demands for reduced security would come under Britain’s Investigatory Powers Act, and so were not within the scope of the Cloud Act.\n\nThe Justice Department official who conveyed that document to Congress referred questions Wednesday to a department spokeswoman, who said she had nothing to add to the report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Wednesday, Padilla and Lofgren faulted the November certification, saying “it splits the finest of hairs” by suggesting that the Cloud Act didn’t apply to any decryption order. The two lawmakers, who sit on the Judiciary committees in their respective chambers of Congress, asked Bondi to reconsider whether Britain was violating the Cloud Act by ordering a break to Apple’s encryption.\n\nTwo of the people familiar with the certification process said the FBI has pursued backdoor capabilities unsuccessfully in the United States and would have been in a stronger legal position to win that if Apple had already had to create such a mechanism for another government.\n\nThe FBI did not respond to a request for a comment. The U.K. Home Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment and has previously said it does not comment on “operational matters.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGabbard on Tuesday wrote to Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Arizona) saying she had directed a legal review of the order and had not known of it before it was reported by The Washington Post and confirmed by other publications. The legislators had urged her to act just after her confirmation as the top U.S. intelligence leader.\n\n“I share your grave concern about the serious implications of the United Kingdom, or any foreign country, requiring Apple or any company to create a ‘backdoor’ that would allow access to Americans’ personal encrypted data,” she wrote. “This would be a clear and egregious violation of Americans’ privacy and civil liberties, and open up a serious vulnerability for cyber exploitation by adversarial actors.”\n\nApple was prohibited from disclosing the order to Congress or U.S. regulators under the Investigatory Powers Act, which allows British officials to compel communications and technology providers to assist in government inquiries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile not addressing the existence of the order, when Apple said it was pulling the secure storage from U.K. customers it added that it had never built a back door into its products and never would.\n\nEven the U.K. pullout would not be enough to end the U.K. demand that the tech giant create the back door for spying on those in other countries. Gabbard’s complaints might do that, and she pledged to keep Congress apprised.\n\nThe Cloud Act cooperative agreement bars the British from deliberately seeking information on Americans, but forcing the creation of a universal back door would create a new target not just for law enforcement officials, but also for hackers and spies.\n\n“Any information sharing between a government — any government — and private companies must be done in a manner that respects and protects the U.S. law and the Constitutional rights of U.S. citizens,” Gabbard wrote. “I look forward to ensuring the UK government has taken necessary actions to protect the privacy of American citizens, consistent with the CLOUD Act and other applicable laws.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nU.K. officials and the FBI have complained that the increasing use of end-to-end encryption has stymied investigations into terrorism, child abuse and other serious crimes. Such communications can only be seen by the sending and receiving devices. Apple’s Advanced Data Protection, iMessages and FaceTime are end-to-end encrypted, as are Google Android backups and some chats, Meta’s Messenger and WhatsApp texts, and content sent over Signal.\n\nWhile acknowledging that strong encryption is used by criminals, the vast majority of security professionals and government cyber defenders have endorsed increased adoption as hackers win access to regular emails, text and voice calls.\n\n“Director Gabbard is right to raise alarm over the UK’s demand for backdoor access to Apple users’ encrypted data,” said Kia Hamadanchy, senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. “While this might be a British government demand, it will have huge consequences for anyone in the U.S. with an iPhone.”",

        "full_text": "LONDON — In almost every way, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will walk into the White House on Thursday as an alien in President Donald Trump’s MAGA universe: a former human rights lawyer, a onetime top prosecutor and, after vanquishing Conservatives in elections last summer, the United Kingdom’s most liberal leader in more than a decade.\n\nStarmer arrives already in the crosshairs of Trump adviser Elon Musk, who has derided him on social media as a warrior of wokeism leading Britain toward inevitable civil war (not to mention being “complicit” in mass pedophilia).\n\nBut Starmer is betting the future of U.S.-U.K. relations on milder first words from Trump himself. The president said last month that he had a good relationship with Starmer and, while they differed on “philosophy,” that the Labour Party leader who took office in July had done “a very good job so far.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich reception he finds, as Trump continues to upend transatlantic relations, will help determine how Britain — and Europe — navigates the insurgent president’s upheavals in trade, disparagement of NATO and abrupt lurch toward Russia in the three-year-old war in Ukraine.\n\n“It’s a pretty defining moment, which Trump he meets and how it goes down,” said a British official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to publicly discuss internal deliberations. “What happens over the next few weeks will determine how Keir is viewed as a world leader and how the relationship evolves.”\n\nStarmer will be battling not just for Britain’s standing in Trump’s Washington, but Europe’s, as well. The prime minister has offered himself as a bridge between the White House and Continental capitals reeling from the president’s threats to unwind four generations of American security backing to such a degree that Germany’s presumptive next chancellor said NATO could be finished in its current form by the summer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike other leaders, Starmer approaches the mercurial Trump by trying to walk a line between agreeable and acquiescent, flattery and fealty.\n\nStarmer told Parliament on Tuesday that his government would fast-track a hike in defense spending to reach 2.5 percent of GDP by 2027 — an additional 13.4 billion pounds, or $17 billion a year, that would put Britain on a path to 3 percent in the coming years, the prime minister said. The spike is in line with Trump’s demand that NATO members spend more on their own defense and rely less on Washington’s military might.\n\nAnd in cutting Britain’s modest foreign aid budget to help fund the military boost, Starmer echoed priorities set by Trump, who spent his first weeks in office dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nOn Ukraine, the prime minister praised the president’s head-spinning about-face in favor of Russia for shaking up the conversation and creating new opportunities for ending the war. He pledged British troops as part of a potential international force sent to help secure a negotiated peace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Starmer shows flashes of defiance. He has insisted that Ukraine and Europe must not be sidelined in talks with Russia and that U.S. backing will be “vital” for any multinational security force. Starmer insists that Ukraine remain a candidate for NATO membership, a possibility ruled off-the-table by Trump’s defense secretary.\n\nAnd Starmer rejected outright Trump’s depiction of Ukraine as the aggressor and President Volodymyr Zelensky as a “dictator,” leading a chorus of support for Zelensky that stretched across Britain’s political spectrum. On Monday, Britain announced more than 100 new sanctions against Russia, its largest wave of injunctions since the early days of the invasion.\n\nStarmer will file into the Oval Office three days after French President Emmanuel Macron. Starmer and Macron, who is driving the push for European countries to commit troops to a Ukraine security force, are coordinating their Trump strategies, aides said.\n\n“Our efforts are convergent, concordant and complementary,” said an Elysée official, speaking on the condition of anonymity in line with French government protocol.\n\nIn Britain, the question is whether Starmer, with a personality more technocratic than colorful, will be able to show flashes of the bro-bonhomie that have enlivened Macron’s up-and-down relations with Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStarmer is known for his methodical, some would say ruthless, rise through the ranks of Labour. Without much in the way of oratory or ideology, he deposed his more liberal boss Jeremy Corbyn and dragged the party to the center. Last year, he ended 14 years of Conservative rule with a relentless focus on delivering competent government and “change.”\n\nRarely does he show strong reactions to the inevitable personal attacks that come with politics, a flatness that may serve him well in dealings with Team Trump.\n\nHe initially waved away Musk’s charge last month that he was “complicit in the rape of Britain” for allegedly failing as a crown prosecutor to investigate immigrant gangs accused of grooming and assaulting girls. Only after the story continued to build did Starmer publicly condemn the charges as “lies” and detail his successful prosecutions against the gangs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Keir is absolutely unflappable, he’s levelheaded,” said Josh Simons, a Labour member of Parliament. “That makes him unusually well suited in terms of his temperament to be a bridge between Trump and Europe.”\n\nThere is a long history of Britain trying — with varying success — to be a conduit between the United States and Europe. Some American and British leaders have hit it off; others less so.\n\nMargaret Thatcher once said that Ronald Reagan was “the second-most important man” in her life after her husband. Barack Obama looked to the continent for his “closest ally,” which is how he described German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nStill, it’s hard to imagine Starmer and Trump sharing the personal chemistry of Tony Blair and Bill Clinton, said Rob Ford, a politics expert at the University of Manchester.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“They aren’t going to ever be golfing buddies,” Ford said. “But that’s not what’s being asked of him. Starmer is the kind of politician who will do whatever it takes in order to win, and winning in this case means having influence with the U.S. and being a bridge with Europe.”\n\nOther transatlantic experts said it would be a mistake to rely on outdated nostalgia for past heydays of a “special relationship” with Washington.\n\nTrump may have more of a soft spot for Britain than Musk does, with the golf courses he owns in Scotland and a known fondness for royal family pomp (an invitation to visit King Charles at Balmoral Castle is already in the works, according to British media reports).\n\nBut Trump’s early actions suggest he is less likely than ever to be flattered off his drive to remake Western alliances, said Tim Bale, a politics professor at Queen Mary University of London. Trump “is going to do what he wants to do, whether Starmer sucks up to him or not.”\n\nEllen Francis in Brussels contributed to this report.",

The website offered no explanation for why it had removed some items or how it had arrived at the higher total. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, sent a written statement that did not address the deletions, but provided a broader defense of the cost-cutting initiative, saying it “has already identified billions of dollars in savings.”\n\nThe “wall of receipts” is the only public ledger the organization has produced to document its work. The scale of that ledger’s errors — and the misunderstandings and poor quality control that seemed to underlie them — has raised questions about the effort’s broader work, which has led to mass firings and cutbacks across the federal government.",

        "full_text": "We’ve been telling ourselves the wrong story about Christianity in the United States.\n\nSince surveys began showing a surge in nonreligious adults in the mid-1990s, many have assumed the Christian population was headed downhill with no brakes.\n\nOrganized religion was out of favor, “none of the above” was in, and houses of worship across the country were too busy dealing with aging congregations and rising building costs to find successful ways to bring new people in.\n\nTo be clear, the U.S. Christian population did indeed shrink over the past 30 years, but a major new religion survey shows the trend line unexpectedly leveled off around 2019.\n\nFor the past five years, the share of U.S. adults who identify as Christian has hovered between 60% and 64%, while the share who identify as unaffiliated has similarly stalled around 29%, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nMany questions remain about whether this recent stabilization is sustainable, but religion scholars say we should be ready for more plot twists.\n\n“I was quite surprised by the data, but in a broader sense, I wasn’t surprised,” said John C. Green, a political scientist at the University of Akron who consulted with Pew on the new study. “I’m always expecting the unexpected. That’s what it means to be in a dynamic religious landscape.”\n\nReligious change in the U.S.\n\nPew’s new Religious Landscape Study offers an in-depth, authoritative look at religion in the U.S.\n\nThink of it like a census focused on faith and spirituality, instead of your household makeup.\n\nThe latest survey, which was fielded in 2023 and 2024, builds on reports from 2007 and 2014. Not all questions from each report can be directly compared, but researchers built a variety of trend lines.\n\nIn summarizing those trends during a Feb. 19 press briefing, Greg Smith, the senior associate director of research at Pew, spoke about two different time periods.\n\nOver the long term, organized religion has experienced a broad-based decline. The Christian share of the population fell from 78% in 2007 to 62% in the new study, while the unaffiliated share surged from 16% to 29% over the same 17-year period.\n\nBut in the short term, the numbers have held pretty steady, especially when compared to data collected from 2007 to 2019.\n\n“After many years of decline, it’s striking … to have observed this recent period of stability,\" said Smith, who worked on all three religious landscape studies.\n\nThe recent stabilization stems from two key factors, according to Smith and other researchers.\n\nFirst, beginning around 2019, religious Americans of all ages stuck with religion at higher rates than expected.\n\nAnd second, young adults born from 2000 to 2006 have turned out to be about as religious as adults born in the 1990s. Researchers had been expecting a notable religious decline from one birth cohort to the next.\n\n“Today’s youngest adults aren’t really less religious than the second youngest cohort and that limits how much the youngest cohort is tugging down on the nation’s overall religiousness,” Smith said.\n\nReligion experts don’t know for sure what caused these two developments, but some believe the COVID-19 pandemic played a role.\n\nAlthough COVID-19 forced temporary church closures, it also prompted congregations to boost their outreach efforts and their use of livestreaming technology.\n\nThose shifts, along with the fact that tragedy often draws people closer to God, likely contributed to the religious landscape’s recent stabilization, Green said.\n\n“The spiritual needs of people went up quite dramatically during the pandemic,” he said. “It could very well be that many people found what organized religion could offer them to be particularly rewarding.”\n\nA lasting change?\n\nPew’s study is focused on the past and present of American religion, but it raises some important questions about the future.\n\nThe data suggests that the share of U.S. adults who identify as religious will begin to trend downward again soon, in part because the highly religious cohort of older Americans will shrink as its members die and in part because younger Americans are not expected to grow more religious as they age.\n\n“If the religiousness of today’s young adults stays the same, and future generations look more like today’s young adults than like today’s older adults, then we’d expected to see a resumption of long-term secularization trends,” Smith said.\n\nSo what could flip the script?\n\nTo keep the trend line stable or even increase the share of Americans who identify as religious, faith groups will need to attract new members.\n\nThat’s easier said than done, but religion experts believe the new Pew study points to some potential strategies.\n\nMost notably, the study identified the broad appeal of spiritual beliefs.\n\nEighty-six percent of U.S. adults believe people have a soul or spirit in addition to a physical body, 83% believe in God or a universal spirit and 79% believe there is something spiritual beyond the natural world, Pew found.\n\n“When asked how their levels of spirituality may have changed over the course of their lifetimes, Americans who say they have become more spiritual outnumber those who say they have become less spiritual by a roughly four-to-one margin (43% vs. 11%),\" researchers wrote.\n\nDuring Pew’s Feb. 19 press briefing, Penny Edgell, a sociologist at the University of Minnesota who consulted on the report, described these figures as “remarkable” and said that religion scholars and others who care about the future of faith need to pay more attention to spiritual beliefs.\n\n“I was trying to think of anything else that 86% of Americans agree on. That’s remarkably high,” she said.\n\nSimilarly, Green said the new data on spirituality presents an opportunity to religious organizations.\n\n“To the extent that religious communities can address spiritual concerns, they may very well draw people back in. If that happens, the pause (in the decline of organized religion) will become a plateau and the plateau may ultimately become growth,” he said.\n\nAnother takeaway from the new study is that faith groups will have to make institution-level adjustments to spur growth, since the power of parents is declining.\n\nAlthough kids raised in religious homes are still much more likely than their peers to become religious adults, the “stickiness” of childhood faith is declining, Smith said.\n\nIn other words, religious children today aren’t as likely to become religious adults as they were in the past.\n\nPolitics and religion\n\nIf Christian congregations don’t find a way to draw in religiously unaffiliated Americans, a couple things will likely happen over the next few decades.\n\nFirst, as already noted, the trend line for U.S. adults who identify as Christians will start moving downward again.\n\nSecond, existing congregations will grow older and more conservative, since politically liberal adults are leaving Christianity at higher rates than politically conservative adults.\n\n“The share of self-described political liberals who identify as Christians has fallen 25 percentage points since 2007, from 62% to 37%. Among self-described conservatives, the Christian share has declined 7 points, from 89% to 82%,” Pew reported.\n\nAlready, faith groups are less politically mixed — and less diverse in general — than they were in the past, Green said.\n\nTo people who see churches as a place where Americans build bridges across lines of difference, that’s a negative development, he noted. But homogeneity may actually help faith groups attract new members in the coming years.\n\n“From the point of view of congregational stability, homogeneity is good because people don’t engage in arguments very much about things beyond the faith,” Green said.\n\nMore progressive congregations, in particular, may benefit from marketing themselves as a place where currently nonreligious — but politically active — liberals can find kindred spirits, Green added.\n\n“One of biggest opportunities for growth would be among people who have more progressive views,” he said.\n\nOther survey takeaways\n\nIf you include the appendixes, Pew’s new report is nearly 400 pages long. It includes much more data on religious beliefs and practices than what’s discussed above.\n\nThe Deseret News will do deeper dives on the report in the coming months. For now, here’s a quick overview of other key takeaways.\n\nThe share of Americans who identify as Protestant has notably declined since 2007, but it’s been relatively stable since 2019 — the same pattern that appears if you look at the data for all Christians. But in recent years, Protestants have been gravitating toward nondenominational churches and away from established denominations, like the United Methodist Church.\n\nTwo percent of respondents to the 2023-24 Religious Landscape Study identified as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. That figure is virtually unchanged since 2007, Pew reported.\n\nThe share of U.S. adults who identify with a non-Christian religious group has been trending upward over the past two decades. In 2007, 4.7% of Americans identified as Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu or part of some other non-Christian faith group. Now, that figure stands at 7.1%.\n\nImmigrants are driving the growth of non-Christian religious groups in the U.S., but that doesn’t mean there are more non-Christian immigrants than Christian immigrants, according to Smith. Fifty-eight percent of U.S. immigrants are Christian, while 14% identify with other religions.\n\nHistorically, American women have been more religiously active than American men. That’s still true today, but the gender gap is small in younger generations. “Among the oldest adults in the new survey (ages 74 and older), the share of women who say they pray every day is 20 points higher than among men. By contrast, among the youngest adults (ages 18 to 24), the share of women who say they pray daily (30%) is similar to the share of men who say they do the same (26%); the 4-point gap is not statistically significant,” Pew reported.\n\nTo dive into the data yourself, check out the full survey report and the accompanying interactive website.\n\nPew’s methodology\n\nThe 2023-24 Religious Landscape Study was conducted from July 17, 2023, to March 4, 2024, in English and Spanish.\n\nPew used address-based sampling to create its nationally representative sample of 36,908 U.S. adults.\n\nMost participants took the survey online, but they had the option of participating via paper form or phone conversation.\n\nThe 2007 and 2014 studies, on the other hand, were administered entirely by phone.\n\nThe “mode change” in 2023-24 explains why researchers weren’t always comfortable making direct comparisons between the earlier studies and the new data, according to Alan Cooperman, Pew’s director of religion research.\n\nThe margin of error for the full sample in 2023-24 is plus or minus 0.8 percentage points.",

        "full_text": "Newsom is hardly the first politician to have his own podcast platform. But in an interview with POLITICO Tuesday, he pointed to aspects he believes differentiate it from the typical gabfest: He’s an officeholder booking guests he vehemently disagrees with — occasionally to spar, but with the goal of building out a forum that illuminates their respective positions.\n\n“We already know what our disagreements are with the MAGA movement. I want to understand what the motivations are, the legitimacy of those motivations, and just really understand where people are coming from,” Newsom said. “They are influential — they are. They explain more things in more ways on more days about what’s going on and if we’re not trying to understand their motivations, we will be victims of their motivations.”\n\nNewsom, a student of the right-wing ecosystem who is both fascinated and distressed by its ability to elevate subjects into the mainstream, mentioned his regular appearances on Fox News, Newsmax and other conservative outlets. He debated Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in late 2023, moderated by Fox’s Sean Hannity, who remains in regular touch with Newsom. He ran a series of TV ads in red states over the last two years calling attention to their anti-abortion laws.\n\nBut his show, premiering in the coming weeks, won’t be confined to crashing the ascendent right-wing.\n\n“At the same time, I want Democrats to come on and sort of challenge where we are on a lot of these issues,” Newsom said. “And so I’m asking the same questions you’re asking of me: Where the hell is the Democratic Party? What are we doing? Who are we? Where are we going? What’s the path back? I’m having the exact same conversations, and I just thought it’d be a hell of a lot more interesting to do it publicly and to do it as honestly as I can.”\n\nReferring to his podcast host persona as “practitioner, not pundit,” Newsom said he wants to give conversations from the show immediate relevance by taking some from concept to action, including new policy approaches and ways he can try to better connect with Californians.\n\n“I’m here to stress test positions, including my own, in a more transparent manner,” he added. “It’s not a place everyone comes for therapy. I’m not looking to just give the orthodoxy — progressive and liberal talking points. There are so many outstanding people doing that, like our gifted professionals. I add no value in that space. I’m a redundant voice … But what I think I can offer is as a practitioner — not an ideologue, not a pundit: I’m in it as much or more than most elected officials in this country, because I’m in the largest state. I’m in a state that’s deeply on the mind of the administration. I’m in a state that is profoundly critical to the fate and future as it relates to some of the most critical industries like artificial intelligence, and obviously in this remarkable moment as it relates to geopolitical re-calibration.”\n\nNewsom has largely resisted offering a fulsome postmortem after his party’s miserable 2024 election, though he said the notebook he’s jotted ideas in has grown from eight handwritten pages to 28 as more numerical and anecdotal data emerges. His approach on the podcast recalls the Newsom of early 2022, who grew increasingly exasperated about the lack of aggressiveness to confront resurgent Republicans in the national culture wars. Ultimately, he rallied behind the party’s leaders and became a top surrogate for former President Joe Biden.\n\nNewsom said his goal isn’t to circumvent the news media but to take advantage of his position and deep contact list “to engage, promote and explore dialogue.” He counts comedian Bill Maher’s HBO program and podcast as creative inspiration for his new program, contending the host finds common ground with adversaries while taking frequent aim at Democratic dogma.\n\n“I watch him because I appreciate how he calls balls and strikes — takes shots at both parties,” said Newsom, a regular guest of Maher’s “Real Time.” “He has a broader value set that is more aligned with mine, but he doesn’t have a problem in suffering fools on either side of the aisle.”\n\nSam Griffel, who has worked closely with Newsom as a producer on the iHeart podcasts, said his latest effort has an underlying imperative: make sure it’s digestible and authentic, not inaccessible and canned.\n\n“We as a society are good at sniffing out that type of BS,” he said. “So for me, the more we’re willing to be pushing into areas of discomfort for our guests and hosts the more real it will be.”\n\nAsked if guests — particularly Democrats who see the world similarly to him — will be as candid on the podcast as they are in private texts and calls with him, Newsom conceded, “that ultimately will be determinative if this is interesting or not.”\n\nNewsom declined to name the half-dozen guests he said have privately agreed to come on with him. “I don’t want to lose these folks by letting their names out there,” he said. But he gave a big hint: ”Look at the lineup at CPAC.”\n\n“It’s that crew. These are the guys right now who are enjoying their status, they’re enjoying their moment, and they’re having not just a moment here, but around the world. And we want to explore that,” he said.\n\nThe Conservative Political Action Conference’s recent straw poll identified Newsom and Sen. Adam Schiff as the two Democrats who pose the greatest threat to the U.S. and the GOP.\n\nNewsom is no stranger to his own broadcasts. As lieutenant governor, he hosted the weekly “Gavin Newsom Show,” which briefly ran on San Francisco-based Current TV and featured interviews with guests from Hollywood and Silicon Valley including the then lesser-known tech entrepreneur Elon Musk. A literary memoir he wrote was scheduled for release on May 13, but has been delayed until at least the fall.\n\nNewsom starts his new venture at the top of a crowded two years in his final term. He’s facing state budget pressures, a hostile federal government and an immense rebuilding effort after the most expensive disaster in U.S. history.\n\nWhile he didn’t spend time focusing his remarks about the new podcast on specific challenges he faces in his last months in office, it will broaden his platform to push back on misinformation he encountered during the wildfires that tore through Los Angeles last month.\n\nThe governor, a natural political pugilist, has largely been reluctant of late to take shots at Trump as he works to appeal to the president for federal disaster aid. Newsom believes that Democrats like himself can have more of an impact by zeroing in on key actions he finds especially detestable like deep cuts to Medicaid.\n\n“Those become the dominant moments, from my perspective, where we need to align and be more aggressive,” he said. “People are pushing back. Republicans are now starting to wake up. I think we’ve moved from resignation to now more and more resistance. I think that’s very positive. The question then becomes, how do you strategically do that?”\n\nHis word of the year to describe the Trump administration, as he put it, is “betrayal.”\n\n“Fire and fury. What does it signify? Something or nothing?” Newsom asked about the early actions from Washington, allowing that the Musk-led government cuts have added to peoples’ anxiety. “If it signifies something, you got to call that out. And that’s the ‘betrayal.’”\n\nBut equally on his radar is Democrats not being overly reactive and instead taking matters into their own hands.\n\n“How do we break through? Are we just reacting to noise with more noise? Are we more strategic this time, and are we going to pierce the consciousness, not just of our base, they’re already with us, but those that we need to bring back?” he asked, describing those and the other questions he posed in the interview as central themes of the podcast project.\n\nDespite constant criticism from the right, Newsom said he’s not overly worried about giving certain MAGA personalities a platform, though when asked about the conspiracist Alex Jones, he said some characters were likely a bridge too far.\n\nInstead, if anything, he said Democrats have avoided or outright ignored the right at their own peril, and praised former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg’s “go-everywhere, talk-to-everyone” strategy that calls for calmly confronting opponents on their own turf.\n\n“I think the biggest mistake we’ve made is staying in the warm embrace of our ideological lane. And it didn’t work out for us. We are sitting here on the sidelines right now trying to figure out how to get back in the game,” Newsom said.",

        "full_text": "Hochul has begun publicly positioning herself as a major Democratic opponent of President Donald Trump, clashing with him last week over his intervention to kill New York City’s controversial congestion pricing plan. She trolled the president again on Tuesday, flipping Trump’s famous catchphrase to attract workers laid off by Elon Musk’s DOGE.\n\n“The federal government might say, ‘You’re fired,’ but here in New York, we say, ‘You’re hired.’ In fact, we love federal workers,” Hochul said in a video statement on X. “Whatever your skills, we value public service. Check out potential jobs at ny.gov/wewantyou. Come join our New York State family.”\n\nNew York State Department of Civil Service Commissioner and Civil Service Commission President Timothy R. Hogues elaborated on Hochul’s call, saying the state is seeking the “best and brightest” to take up the “noble calling” of public service.\n\n“Under Governor Hochul’s leadership, we have been working hard to retain and recruit the next generation of employees and servant-leaders. By coming to work for the Empire State, you’ll have the opportunity to help your neighbors, community and state in a variety of ways — serving, protecting, and caring for your fellow New Yorkers and our wonderful resources in solid, stable jobs,” he said in a statement obtained by ABC 7 News.\n\nHochul isn’t the only one who has sought to tap into the skills of newly laid-off federal workers. Trump ally Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) expressed sympathy for the over 10,000 federal workers laid off by DOGE, urging them to take advantage of the Virginia job market.\n\n“Today, Virginia stands as the top state for business, with tremendous job opportunities across the Commonwealth. ‘Virginia Has Jobs’ is an opportunity for every Virginian — and every business — to capitalize on the thriving economy, with more than 250,000 open jobs waiting to be filled,” Youngkin said.\n\nThe governor added that Virginia was there to help and support the recently unemployed workers.\n\n“I want to reiterate that if you are in our federal workforce. We care about you. We want to support you. We want to make sure that if you experience any job interruption or changes, that you know where to go to get support infrastructure to find that next great opportunity with one of these fabulous employers,” Youngkin said.\n\nYoungkin’s offer would be easier for many, as 145,000, 6.3% of all federal workers, reside in Virginia.\n\nLed by Musk, DOGE has aimed to slash government spending by cutting programs and shrinking the federal workforce. The effort has come under fierce criticism from elected Democrats, highlighting individual cases of workers laid off by the department.\n\nHochul’s trolling of Trump regarding the laid-off federal workers is her latest move in a public campaign against the native New Yorker. The usually reserved governor adopted a stark change in tone on Wednesday in response to the Department of Transportation’s intervention regarding congestion pricing.\n\n“I’m here to say: New York hasn’t labored under a king in over 250 years,” she said to cheers. “We sure as hell are not going to start now.”\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nGoing beyond congestion pricing, Hochul said the problem was secondary and that Trump’s move represented “an attack on our sovereign identity, our independence from Washington.”\n\n“We are not subservient to a king or anyone else out of Washington,” she said. “So this is the fight we’re in. We’re fighting for our residents, our commuters, our riders, our drivers, our emergency personnel.”",

Share Copy Link ✓ Link copied to clipboard! Millions of Social Security recipients impacted by the Social Security Fairness Act will no longer have to wait up to a year for their benefits to increase, the Social Security Administration (SSA) has announced. Why It Matters Earlier this year, lawmakers passed a bill that would repeal the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO). Both of these reduced Social Security benefits for millions of workers, including teachers, firefighters, and police officers, and some federal employees. Signing the act into law, former President Joe Biden said it would permanently boost Social Security benefits for more than 2.8 million recipients, and that retroactive payments backdated to January 2024 would also be issued. But these groups were told that it could take up to a year for backdated payments and renewed benefits amounts to be administered. What To Know The WEP reduced Social Security benefits for individuals who receive pensions from public-sector jobs—such as those held by state and federal employees—that did not require Social Security payroll tax contributions. This reduction applied even if they contributed to Social Security through other employment and qualified for benefits. The GPO reduced spousal or survivor benefits for retired federal, state, and local government workers who did not pay into Social Security funds through their payroll taxes.

GETTY Now, the SSA has confirmed that impacted groups, consisting of some 3.2 million people, will receive a one-time retroactive payment by the end of March . Higher benefits—which former President Biden said would be an average $360 a month—will be administered from April onward. The SSA has said that, \"depending on factors such as the type of Social Security benefit received and the amount of the person's pension, the change in payment amount will vary from person to person.\" The federal agency added that impacted recipients \"will receive a mailed notice from Social Security explaining the benefit change or retroactive payment.\" Why Were Payments Delayed? On its website, the SSA said it was \"finalizing its plan to implement the act while limiting negative effects on our regular workloads and services to the public.\" However, the implementation of the Act is being hampered by a hiring freeze and \"ongoing staff shortages,\" the SSA said. The administration added that it expected it \"could take more than one year to adjust benefits and pay all retroactive benefits.\" What People Are Saying Lee Dudek, acting commissioner of Social Security, said in a press release issued on February 25 : \"Social Security's aggressive schedule to start issuing retroactive payments in February and increase monthly benefit payments beginning in April supports President Trump's priority to implement the Social Security Fairness Act as quickly as possible. \"The agency's original estimate of taking a year or more now will only apply to complex cases that cannot be processed by automation. The American people deserve to get their due benefits as quickly as possible.\" John Hatton, staff vice president of policy and programs at National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, told Federal News Network : \"SSA's announcement that they will begin paying benefits to those impacted by WEP and GPO this week is music to our ears. This is much quicker than previously forecast, and will have an immediate, positive impact on those who have waiting decades for this relief.\" What Happens Next With payments expected to arriving over the next two months, the SSA has urged beneficiaries to wait until April to ask about the status of their retroactive payment since these payments will be processed incrementally into March. As for increased monthly payments, new amounts will be distributed starting in April's payment, so beneficiaries should wait until after receiving it before contacting Social Security if they have any queries about their monthly benefit amount. fairness meter fairness meter Newsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.

        "full_text": "In United States Vice President JD Vance’s February 14th speech at the Munich Security Conference, he criticized Romania's annulment of its presidential election held in December and spoke to several large issues facing Europe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Romanian government nullified the election results on \"flimsy suspicions of an intelligence agency and enormous pressure from its continental neighbors,” remarked Vance.\n\nThe new presidential vote is planned for May 4, with a possible run-off vote scheduled for May 18.\n\nThe vice president also took the opportunity to call out European Union \"commissars\" for suppressing free speech, failing to address mass migration, and retreating from \"some of its most fundamental values.” He then implored Europe to step up as President Trump works to find an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nFollowing Vice President Vance’s speech, former Prime Minister and current member of the Chamber of Deputies Victor Ponta spoke to Townhall Media.\n\nTownhall Media: Thank you, sir. Before we get to the vice president's speech in Munich, can you clear up speculation or say something more on the reports that you are \"determined\" to enter the presidential race?\n\nVictor Ponta: Now, I can be very clear. Yes, I will run, and yes, I will be the president of Romania.\n\nTownhall Media: During the vice president’s speech, he questioned the annulment of last year’s Romanian election due to alleged Russian interference, implying that such actions undermine democratic resilience. Given these assertions, how do you perceive Romania’s position within the broader U.S.-Europe relationship? Should Romania align more closely with U.S. perspectives on governance and free speech, or maintain its current trajectory within the European framework?\n\nVictor Ponta: Ever since we threw away the shackles of communism, Romania and its people have committed to a special partnership with the U.S. As prime minister of Romania ten years ago, I had to take strategic decisions that proved this. For example, to buy for the Romanian Airforce F16 jets, to release the first licences for shale gas and offshore gas to Chevron and Exxon. We hold the second-largest American military base on the continent.\n\nBut now, with the new administration led by President Trump, the enthusiasm of Romanians about America is even greater. The absolute majority of Romanians are sharing the values promoted by the MAGA movement: God, family, country, peace. Mr. Trump is very popular in my country.\n\nRomania will always be in Europe and a proud member of the EU, but when I’m elected as president, I will advocate for more alignment with the U.S. There is no NATO without the U.S., and there is no reliable military or energetic security for the continent without the U.S. As president of Romania, I would come immediately to the Trump administration with a clear common project to make Mihail Kogalniceanu Air Base (MKAB) in Romania, the largest U.S. base in Europe, and another economic project to develop with American companies in the field of huge natural resources which are already confirmed in the Black sea and the Carpathian areas.\n\nRomanian people are disappointed by the bureaucracy and lack of transparency in Brussels, as we witnessed during the COVID pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Most of all, the shameful decision to cancel the second round of elections in our country without evidence or reasonable cause – and without any pushback from Europe. And so, besides military and economic cooperation, I strongly believe that only the U.S. can guarantee for Romania a clear and sustainable return to free speech and democratic elections. The people of Romania must have a voice and be allowed to vote for whomever they want, and I greatly welcome the new administration’s firm stance on that issue.\n\nTownhall Media: Reflecting some more on last year’s cancelled elections, what measures would you propose to strengthen Romania’s electoral integrity? How can Romania balance the need for security with the preservation of democratic processes and public trust?\n\nVictor Ponta: The first thing we have to do is transfer the power back to the people. We have a ridiculous situation where the banning of candidates or annulling elections is completely in the hands of a few judges without any oversight or participation of parliament. The ultimate sovereign is completely shut out. When I was PM, it was different. But after I left office, it was changed into a non-transparent and undemocratic way. The system in Romania is stronger than the people’s will, and this is the greatest cause of anger and distrust.\n\nThe core values of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of elections, where the people are the sovereign, have been lost, taken hostage in the last ten years by a system that serves its own interests – God forbid even foreign interests – and not the Romanian people. Only in very, very extreme cases do security interests need to outweigh democratic ones – and that principle has been lost in Romania.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI saw that system from very close when I was prime minister 10 years ago. I started to fight it by reforming old economic structures and creating a powerful and free economy. People had more money in their pockets and more freedom back then. But the system manipulated my elections for president and even killed people to force me out of office. They continued to chase me, tried to prosecute me and imprison me, and I had to fight for my innocence, just like Mr. Trump.\n\nI made my mistakes but now I come back smarter and stronger. The system cannot threaten me anymore, and I know its weaknesses. I know I have a strong backing from the new U.S. administration, and I’m going to push new reforms to release both the Romanian economy and Romanian democracy because our people deserve to live better. It’s time for the Romanian people to become the first priority and have the system to bow to the sovereign.\n\nTownhall Media: The other weekend, Americans were seeing images on TV of German police arresting people in their homes for social media posts around Europe. Vice President Vance highlighted his concerns about censorship and the suppression of dissent within European countries. What is your stance on these issues within Romania? How would your administration ensure the protection of free speech and political diversity, while safeguarding national security?\n\nVictor Ponta: I can guarantee one thing for sure – when I’m president, no one in Romania will be arrested for social media posts unless there is a clear and present danger that the person is about to commit a serious and violent crime, like in the form of terrorism.\n\nThe rules and atmosphere of public discussion have changed and we must adapt. Things that were forbidden to say a few decades ago are mainstream today. I am totally disgusted by a culture of cancel where certain views are not allowed to be expressed. Limiting free speech is not the answer – open debate is. We cannot close ourselves and listen only to the ones who have a similar opinion to ours.\n\nTownhall Media: With President Trump’s return to office, there appears to be a shift in U.S. foreign policy – emphasizing support for conservative values and a reevaluation of traditional alliances. A recent poll of Romanians had 62% believing that President Trump’s election was good for Romanians. How do you envision Romania navigating its relationship with the U.S. under this administration? What opportunities or challenges do you foresee arising from this renewed U.S. leadership?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVictor Ponta: The trends in America resemble those in Romania. In these times of uncertainties, we begin to realize how important tradition and faith are as a sense of stability, comfort, and guidance. Romanians didn’t lose their faith in God during the years of communism, and now more and more people return to the churches and monasteries that were a great part of our tradition and values.\n\nThere is a side in Europe that is more traditional. Countries like Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Italy present a different attitude towards the North Atlantic relationship than France or Netherlands. We want closer ties with the U.S, and closer economic ties – built on reciprocity and fairness. Romania needs to contribute more to security because that is the only way to secure peace. Europe, without the U.S., is vulnerable, and we must understand that this is a partnership where everyone must feel satisfied. If America thinks it is treated unfairly in terms of trade, we must solve those issues together.\n\nThe problem is that, today, the voice of Romania is absent. We are not a small country in the EU but our leadership behaves as a vassal state with no opinion or contribution. We must have our place at the table and make sure that Romania’s interests are fulfilled. When I was prime minister, Romania was growing fast and was attractive to investments from U.S. companies. Now our economy is headed for stagflation, and no one wants to come. Growth is weak and prices are soaring, because our economy is practically managed by an old, self-serving, corrupt system using economic methods that didn’t even work in the 20th century, let alone in the 21st.\n\nI know how to change this, and the only way is by flipping the system on its head; by cutting down on bloated public administration, cutting down on taxes, using our own resources for energy independence, opening the system for more competition, encouraging consumption, and supporting Romanian small businesses. Just like what is done now by the Trump administration in the U.S.\n\nTownhall Media: You were prime minister of Romania from 2013-2015, and it was thought you were leaving politics at the end of 2020. Then you ran and won a seat in parliament in December. What made you get back into the arena?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVictor Ponta: When I was PM ten years ago, the economy was soaring. We cut taxes and encouraged investments and results soon followed. The money flowed to people’s pockets, and I had even bigger and better plans.\n\nThe system didn’t like it. They manipulated the elections, and – I dare to say – even caused peoples’ deaths in order to turn the people against me and stop me. I couldn’t fight the system and the people at the same time. When I resigned, taking responsibility for things not directly under my control, I said I will always be on the side of the people. I thought others might come in my place and have the opportunity to continue the progress. Instead, the politicians who took control only thought about themselves, gave up on Romania’s interests, and brought our country to misery and almost bankruptcy.\n\nThe last straw was the cancelling of the elections. I understood that the system also wants to take away the people’s voice and that I can no longer remain on the fence. Otherwise, we will really lose everything. We have reached the point of now or never. It is not only shameful and undemocratic but also dangerous. This is the place where democracy ends and tyranny starts.\n\nI want to give people back their voice and their right to choose. I want to give people a sense of control over the system. There is a way to change the system – America has shown us how. And I want to bring the sense of fairness and prosperity back to our people. I have learned from my mistakes and am coming back even more determined to flip the system on its head. I want to put Romanian people in the first place.\n\nTownhall Media: The Trump administration has been critical of the European Union’s bureaucracy and regulatory overreach. How would a pro-Trump Romanian presidency challenge or reform EU policies to make them more favorable to stronger borders, less centralized governance, and greater national autonomy within the Union?\n\nVictor Ponta: The first thing we have to do is look at ourselves. The system in Romania is bloated and inefficient, and that puts a heavy burden on our growth. One of the goals of my project for Romania 2030 is to have an efficient, professional government with a reduced administration. I would like to cut 20% of the Romanian administration workforce across the board, sparing those with direct contact with citizens, like teachers, doctors, and nurses. Such a measure would weed out inefficiency and waste, and allow us to raise salaries for those remaining – thus attracting better people. Citizens are tired of government offices that only serve themselves and a system that doesn’t care about them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTownhall Media: It is often said that a man is measured by the enemies he makes – who are the forces that don’t want you running? What do you say to Romanians who might be undecided?\n\nVictor Ponta: The interference in elections didn’t start today but already existed back when I ran for president 11 years ago. The system used all its powers to manipulate the elections in a very unfair way. After I lost, they didn’t stop. They were afraid of me returning to power and orchestrated the legal system against me. I had to face several bogus charges that eventually were dismissed.\n\nI thank God I was able in the last few years to build my independent business – not connected to anything in Romania. I am totally free from the system, and they cannot threaten me anymore. It is not to say they are not trying. I am getting hints and messages that show me that I am still very much feared by very powerful groups in the Romanian state. In the years since I left office, the system only got stronger, more arrogant, and more determined.\n\nFortunately, today I am more experienced and smarter. I know exactly the weaknesses of the system and how to counter it. I am much more determined than before because I know it is now or never. If the system can get away with cancelling the elections and blocking people’s voices then we are headed for doom. In these elections, I ask voters to consider who has a plan to transfer power from the system to the people, and who already has experience in making Romanians – and not the system – wealthier and more prosperous. We have a resourceful and rich country, and our citizens should be the first ones to benefit and enjoy this. Romanians should feel they are in the first place, not some self-serving system beholden by corruption and foreign interests.\n\nTownhall Media: Thank you. As we wrap up, what would you like to say to the average American citizen who may not typically pay attention to Romanian politics from 5,000-6,000 miles away?\n\nVictor Ponta: I want to say to all Americans that Romania and Europe are your allies in making a world where the values of democracy and freedom of speech are paramount. I want to say that the U.S. and Romania have lots of economic opportunities to discuss, and we are open to American companies and investors. And I want to say that Romania is one of the most, if not the most, beautiful countries in Europe, with ancient traditions and mysteries – like the home of Count Dracula – and I invite and welcome American tourists to come and explore and enjoy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThank you.\n\n*This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.",

        "full_text": "Eli Lilly on Wednesday said it will invest at least $27 billion to build four new manufacturing sites in the U.S., as demand for its blockbuster weight loss and diabetes injections soars and the company develops new drugs for other conditions.\n\nIt comes as drugmakers and companies across different industries work to build goodwill with President Donald Trump, who has emphasized reshoring manufacturing to the U.S. and reducing reliance on foreign supply chains. He has threatened companies — and pharmaceutical businesses in particular — with tariffs if they do not manufacture products in the U.S.\n\nEli Lilly made the announcement at an event in Washington, D.C. — emphasizing the political undertones of the strategy. The event featured several speakers from the Trump administration, including Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who explicitly tied the announcement to Trump's policies.\n\nLutnick said the investment is \"exactly what the Trump administration is all about, which is building and manufacturing and reshoring in America, investing in America, building in America.\" He thanked Eli Lilly for \"doing exactly what the president was hoping would happen.\"\n\nLutnick added that \"if you want to understand the tariff policy\" of the U.S., \"I have just articulated it.\"\n\nThe move brings Eli Lilly's total U.S. manufacturing investments to more than $50 billion in recent years. The other $23 billion is from the company's investments in new plants and site expansions since 2020, which has helped ease supply shortages of its popular drugs.\n\n\"This represents the largest pharmaceutical expansion investment in U.S. history,\" Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said at the event. \"We're making these investments ... to prepare for the demand we anticipate for future pipeline medicines across our therapeutic areas.\"\n\nShares of the company closed more than 1% higher on Wednesday.\n\nThree of the future U.S. sites announced Wednesday will manufacture active ingredients in medications, such as tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly's obesity drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro. Ricks noted that there is a \"real gap in supply chain in the U.S. as it relates to active ingredient availability in our country.\"\n\nThe fourth site will extend the company's global manufacturing network for future injectable therapies, he added.\n\nEli Lilly has not decided on where the four new U.S. sites will be located, Ricks said. The company will be accepting location submissions through March 13 and will announce decisions on new sites in the coming months.\n\nEli Lilly said the four new sites will create more than 3,000 jobs for workers such as engineers and scientists, along with 10,000 construction jobs as the plants are built. The company's other U.S. plants include sites in North Carolina, Indiana and Wisconsin.\n\nThe new investments aren't solely dedicated to Eli Lilly's current and future obesity and diabetes treatments. The company is charting its future beyond Zepbound and Mounjaro, with hopes to deliver drugs from its broad pipeline of products for cancer, Alzheimer's disease and other conditions.\n\nRicks said the company is optimistic about its pipeline across therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic health, oncology, immunology and neuroscience.\n\nStill, the new investments build on the success of Zepbound and Mounjaro, which share dominance of the booming market for so-called GLP-1 drugs with Novo Nordisk 's weight loss drug Wegovy and diabetes treatment Ozempic. Some analysts expect the global obesity drug market to be worth more than $150 billion annually by the early 2030s, making it critical for both companies to maintain their share as other drugmakers scramble to join.\n\nDuring the event, Ricks took a shot at cheaper compounded versions of its injectable drugs, saying \"America faces a growing threat from an influx of counterfeit and compounded medications.\"\n\nEli Lilly's efforts to boost the supply of Zepbound and Mounjaro aim to ensure that eligible patients are safely accessing those branded treatments instead of cheaper compounded versions. Patients flocked to those unapproved copycats when the branded drugs were in short supply, or if they didn't have insurance coverage for the costly treatments.\n\nThe FDA has since declared the shortage of tirzepatide over, which will essentially bar many compounding pharmacies from making copycats.\n\nHassett said the issue also \"disturbs the White House\" because offshore producers of copycat drugs are \"threatening lives in the U.S.\"",

        "full_text": "Organic farmers and environmental groups sued the Agriculture Department on Monday over its scrubbing of references to climate change from its website.\n\nThe department had ordered staff to take down pages focused on climate change on Jan. 30, according to the suit, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Within hours, it said, information started disappearing.\n\nThat included websites containing data sets, interactive tools and funding information that farmers and researchers relied on for planning and adaptation projects, according to the lawsuit.\n\nAt the same time, the department also froze funding that had been promised to businesses and nonprofits through conservation and climate programs. The purge then “removed critical information about these programs from the public record, denying farmers access to resources they need to advocate for funds they are owed,” it said.\n\nThe Agriculture Department referred questions about the lawsuit to the Justice Department, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe suit was filed by lawyers from Earthjustice, based in San Francisco, and the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, on behalf of the Northeast Organic Farming Association of New York, based in Binghamton; the Natural Resources Defense Council, based in New York; and the Environmental Working Group, based in Washington. The latter two groups relied on the department website for their research and advocacy, the lawsuit said.\n\nPeter Lehner, a lawyer for Earthjustice, said the pages being purged were crucial for farmers facing risks linked to climate change, including heat waves, droughts, floods, extreme weather and wildfires. The websites had contained information about how to mitigate dangers and adopt new agricultural techniques and strategies. Long-term weather data and trends are valuable in the agriculture industry for planning, research and business strategy.\n\n“You can purge a website of the words climate change, but that doesn’t mean climate change goes away,” Mr. Lehner said.\n\nThe sites under the department’s umbrella include those of the Forest Service, which is responsible for stewardship of forests and grasslands; the Natural Resources Conservation Service, which helps landowners implement conservation practices; and those of other divisions focused on farms and ranches, disaster recovery and rural development.\n\nThe directive to delete the pages came by email from Peter Rhee, the department’s director of digital communications, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege the actions violated three federal laws and were “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” They asked the court to compel the agency to restore the pages and to block it from deleting any others.\n\nWes Gillingham, president of the board of Northeast Organic Farming Association of New York, said that farmers were just heading into planning for the summer growing season. He said taking information down because of a “political agenda about climate change” was senseless.\n\nMr. Gillingham said his organization is the largest organic certifier in New York State, which is a major hub for small farms. They often send farmers to the Agriculture Department website for information on things like conservation programs and which agricultural practices qualify for grants and loans. They also direct people to resources like equipment lending.\n\n“Right now, because of climate change and because of what farmers are facing in terms of extreme weather events, we need every piece of available information we can get,” he said. “We don’t have access to that, we’re not going to make it.”",

        "full_text": "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has given all intelligence agencies until Friday to identify the employees participating in pornographic chats while on duty, revoke their security clearances, and terminate their employment. In a memo released Tuesday evening, Gabbard responded decisively to revelations that numerous employees who were members of a National Security Agency chat system used it to discuss fetishes, kink, and sex as part of the agency's DEI program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis story broke yesterday (see EXPOSED: NSA, CIA, FBI, and Others Used Government Resources to Do Absolutely Deranged, Disgusting Things – RedState and NSA, CIA Respond to Reports of Concerning Chats in Federal Messaging System – RedState) with the revelation that what seemed to be transgender members of the Intelligence Community representing several intelligence agencies had essentially hijacked two channels on the secure Intelink messaging platform, which helpfully reminds users:\n\nThis is a United States Government computer system. This computer system, including all related equipment, networks, and network devices, including Internet access, are provided only for authorized U.S. Government use. U.S. Government computer systems may be monitored for all lawful purposes, including ensuring that their use is authorized, for management of the system, to facilitate protection against unauthorized access, and to verify security procedures, survivability, and operational security. Monitoring includes authorized attacks by authorized U.S. Government entities to test or verify the security of this system. During monitoring, information may be examined, recorded, copied, and used for authorized purposes. All information including personal information, placed on or sent over this system may be monitored.\n\nUse of this U.S. Government system, authorized or unauthorized, constitutes consent to monitoring of this system. Unauthorized use may subject you to criminal prosecution. Evidence of unauthorized use collected during monitoring may be used for administrative, criminal or other adverse actions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe two channels were called LBTQA and IC_Pride_TWG, which were affiliated with LGBTQ+ “employee resource groups” and promoted by agency leadership.\n\nIn this case, “diversity” was not a byword for racialism, but rather a euphemism for sex talk. Last January, chatroom members discussed their practice of polyamory, or “ethical non-monogamy.” “[A] polycule is a polyamorous group,” one employee explained. “A is my [girlfriend], and B-G are her partners. . . . then B&C are dating but not C&D, nor E, F, or G with any of the others, though there are several MWB (metas-with-benefits) connections.” Another employee claimed to be part of a nine-member “polycule,” adding that “some of our friends are practically poly-mers, with all the connected compounds.”\n\nAt other times, the conversations became explicit. The active source at the NSA claimed to have witnessed hundreds of sexually provocative discussions, which, he added, occurred mostly on taxpayer time. The former NSA source who was familiar with the chats recalled being “disgusted” by a particularly shocking thread discussing weekend “gangbangs.”\n\nThe NSA sources also raised the question of some staffers’ mental fitness for the job. In one chat, an NSA employee insists on using “it” pronouns in lieu of the human “he” or “she” pronouns. “[I]t/its user here. While I understand we can make some people uncomfortable, keep in mind that the dehumanizing aspect either a) doesn’t apply or b) is a positive effect when we’re requesting it.” A commenter who disagreed was quickly dismissed by employees of the NSA and CIA, who claimed that refusing to use “it/its” pronouns amounted to “erasing” a transgender identity.\n\n“These are folks with top secret clearances believing they are an IT!” said the NSA source.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe conversations became highly politicized as well as sexually grotesque as Inauguration Day approached, and Gabbard became a target of criticism.",

        "full_text": "The White House provided an answer to a question Tuesday that had been swirling around Elon Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service for days: Who, officially, is in charge?\n\nA White House official said the DOGE administrator is Amy Gleason, a former health-care executive who worked for the agency in a previous iteration. Now Gleason is positioned, at least on paper, to oversee a massive effort to reshape the federal government that has become synonymous with Musk.\n\nThe disclosure comes just days after the director of the White House Office of Administration sparked confusion by declaring in a court filing that Musk, the special government employee whom President Donald Trump said in November would lead the cost-cutting group, has “no actual or formal authority” over government decisions. Moreover, the filing said Musk “is not the U.S. DOGE Service Administrator,” the position outlined in the executive order establishing the U.S. DOGE Service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGleason is former chief product officer at Russell Street Ventures, the firm founded by health-care entrepreneur and DOGE adviser Brad Smith, according to her LinkedIn profile. Before that she worked for the U.S. Digital Service, the U.S. DOGE Service’s predecessor agency, during Trump’s first term.\n\nAt the USDS “she led the creation of the national covid database and products that used that data to drive the federal response,” an online bio for a speaking opportunity reads.\n\nFriends and former colleagues of Gleason described her as a trained nurse who worked to design electronic medical records, motivated in part by her daughter’s struggle with an autoimmune disease. The Obama administration in 2015 honored those efforts, calling her a “champion of change.” She later joined the U.S. Digital Service during the Trump administration, where she worked on the nation’s coronavirus response. Smith, the health-care entrepreneur who helped oversee the Trump administration’s efforts to fight the pandemic, then hired Gleason in senior roles at his firms. Smith is now helping oversee DOGE’s operations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Amy is a world-class talent, inspired by her personal journey with the health system to make it better for everyone,” said Aneesh Chopra, who served as the Obama administration’s chief technology officer and has worked with Gleason on several health-care initiatives, such as an effort called “Blue Button” to make Medicare data available to patients.\n\n“In product terms, she knows how to ‘ship’ digital services and was quickly tapped to manage the seemingly insurmountable challenge of building a real time map of health capacity during the pandemic,” said Chopra in a written message. “Whatever Amy’s role is at DOGE (USDS), leaders like her should instill greater confidence that the work will benefit the American people. I remain in the camp that more effective and efficient government is — and should remain — a bipartisan endeavor.”\n\nGleason has spoken about her family’s challenges of trying to navigate the complexities of the U.S. health system, arguing that the federal government has the power to cut through bureaucracy and red tape. “One thing that I’ve learned about joining the government is you get to work on really cool problems that affect all of Americans,” Gleason said in a YouTube video posted in 2020, touting her efforts to increase access to Medicare data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I’ve enjoyed knowing her professionally,” said Laurie Smith, a longtime health-care executive who worked with Gleason years ago on a proposal for a government health-care innovation effort. “She is action-oriented and practical.”\n\nGleason’s appointment is unlikely to change any perception that Musk is in charge of DOGE, but it answers a key question as to its organizational structure.\n\nStaffers at the U.S. DOGE Service said Gleason addressed them this month, as part of an effort to bring the former U.S. Digital Service staff into the fold at DOGE, though they were unaware of her title at the time.",

        "full_text": "The report, “Management Advisory: Army’s Future Soldier Preparatory Course Places Trainees At Increased Risk of Adverse Health Effects,” found that recruiters and leadership at the Army Training Center and Fort Jackson admitted recruits with body fat percentages that did not comply with the military branch’s physical fitness requirements and standards. According to the report, 14% of the recruits admitted between February and May 2024 who became trainees in the Army’s Future Soldier Preparatory Course program exceeded “the allowable 8% above the body fat composition limit for initial entry, with the highest being 19%.” The report specified that no waivers were granted for these conditions, meaning these recruits should have never been admitted into the program.\n\nComplicating the matter, in addition to violating standards, was the strain admitting such people put on the Army’s medical resources, the report noted. Such practices are hazardous given that the recruits admitted above the acceptable body fat percentage levels could experience health problems. They must lose a significant amount of weight in a short period to meet the body fat percentages to graduate.\n\n“Based on interviews with ATC&FJ officials and the Division Medical Director and a review of ATC&FJ medical policy, we determined that ATC&FJ leadership prioritized the program’s already limited medical resources on the 14% of trainees above the authorized body fat composition limit,” the report read. “With the limited medical support and percentage of trainees above the body fat composition limit, the ARMS (Assessment of Recruit Motivation and Strength) 2.0 pilot program trainees are at an increased risk of suffering adverse medical consequences while trying to lose weight in a short time.”\n\nThe possible dangers include the risk of death, the report claimed, due to the need for trainees who were not compliant with body fat requirements “to lose weight quickly to meet the body fat percentage standards.”\n\nAccording to the policy, any recruit who sought to join the Army was supposed to be, at most, only 8% above body fat requirements to enlist before training to comply with military standards.\n\nSENATE CONFIRMS DANIEL DRISCOLL AS NEXT ARMY SECRETARY\n\nThe Army’s Future Soldier Preparatory Course was created to act as a backchannel entrance into the military for those who initially would be disqualified from enlisting due to being unable to meet requirements, such as physical fitness standards, among others, according to Military.com. If a recruit was outside these requirements, the applicant was granted 90 days to comply with Army regulations.\n\nAny recruit who failed to do so would not be admitted into the military branch.",

        "full_text": "US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he plans to offer a \"gold card\" granting wealthy applicants a path to citizenship at a price of $5 million (€4.76 million), replacing an investor visa that has existed for 35 years.\n\nDescribing the people he wanted to see apply, Trump told an Oval Office press conference: \"They'll be wealthy and they'll be successful, and they'll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people, and we think it's going to be extremely successful.\"\n\nAsked whether Russian oligarchs would be eligible for the gold card, Trump responded: “Yeah, possibly. I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people.”\n\nAccording to US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the \"Trump Gold Card\" is intended to replace EB-5 visas in two weeks.\n\nEB-5s were created by Congress in 1990 to generate foreign investment, and are available to people who spend about $1 million on a company that employs at least 10 people in the US.\n\nLutnick explained that the gold card — which would work similarly to a green card, or permanent legal residency, but granted simply in exchange for money — would raise the price of admission for investors and eliminate supposed fraud and \"nonsense\" that he said characterises the EB-5 programme.\n\nLike other green cards, it would include a path to citizenship.\n\nLutnick also said that gold card applicants will be vetted \"to make sure they’re wonderful world-class global citizens,\" but offered no details of how that standard would be set.\n\n'Maybe it will be fantastic'\n\nInvestors' visas or residence permits are common around the world. Henley & Partners, an advisory firm, says more than 100 countries offer so-called \"golden visas\" to wealthy individuals, including the US, UK, Spain, Greece, Malta, Australia, Canada and Italy.\n\nAccording to the US Department of Homeland Security's most recent Yearbook of Immigration Statistics, some 8,000 people obtained EB-5 visas in the year ending 30 September 2022.\n\nHowever, the Congressional Research Service warned in 2021 that the visas pose risks of fraud, including verification that funds were obtained legally.\n\nAnnoucing the gold card, Trump made no mention of any requirements for job creation. And whereas the number of EB-5 visas is capped, Trump mused that the federal government could sell 10 million gold cards, supposedly helping to reduce the deficit.\n\nHe said the proposed card \"could be great, maybe it will be fantastic\".\n\n\"It's somewhat like a green card, but at a higher level of sophistication, it's a road to citizenship for people, and essentially people of wealth or people of great talent, where people of wealth pay for those people of talent to get in, meaning companies will pay for people to get in and to have long, long term status in the country,\" he explained.\n\nWhile Congress sets legal qualifications for citizenship, Trump claimed the implementation of \"gold cards\" would not be subject to congressional approval.",

        "full_text": "As part of his proposed peace plan in Eastern Europe, President Donald Trump is demanding the full-scale economic colonization of Ukraine.\n\nThe terms of Trump’s initial proposal, detailed in a leaked document obtained by The Telegraph, call for U.S. control of Ukraine’s natural resources, ports, and infrastructure, including $500 billion of Ukraine’s mineral wealth as “payback” for the military aid. After years of military aid, Trump has decided now is the time to cash in.\n\nTrump’s proposal asks Ukraine for exclusive rights “in perpetuity” over its natural resources and infrastructure. “This agreement shall be governed by New York law, without regard to conflict of laws principles,” the contract specifies. And revenues would have to be paid to the U.S. before any other party. “That clause means ‘pay us first, and then feed your children,’” a source close to the negotiations told The Telegraph.\n\nTrump’s staggering claim to Ukraine’s mineral wealth is not new. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy himself proposed giving up Ukraine’s natural resources to secure Western aid. And, in Washington, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., previously floated the idea. “They’re sitting on trillion dollars of minerals that could be good for our economy,” Graham said, standing beside Zelenskyy during a visit to Ukraine last year. “So I want to keep helping our friends in Ukraine.”\n\nThe $500 billion figure equates to nearly three times the size of Ukraine’s gross domestic product. And, as observers have pointed out, the extent of Ukraine’s mineral wealth may be overstated. Still, it’s undeniable that Trump aims to use the tragedy of the Ukraine war to fatten the coffers of America’s military-industrial complex and capitalist classes.\n\nIt’s what he does everywhere. The news of Trump’s initial Ukraine proposal follows closely on the heels of his extreme bid to forcibly expel Palestinians from Gaza to turn it into the “Riviera of the Middle East,” a plot that could potentially be used to enrich the real estate developer’s friends.\n\nAs with Palestinians in Gaza, Trump’s vision for enriching his friends in the American ruling class will come at the expense of Ukrainians. And, as in Gaza, Ukraine has no good options, and any deal it accepts with Russia or the U.S. will include painful concessions.\n\nIt didn’t have to be this way.\n\nThere were several points at which a negotiated end to the conflict could have been reached. In the fall of 2022, when Ukraine had more leverage, a group of congressional progressives urged the Biden administration to pair support for Ukraine’s successes with a “proactive diplomatic push” to seek a ceasefire.\n\nThe lawmakers, and the pro-diplomacy camp in general, were relentlessly attacked and smeared for taking the position. Hawks and the so-called pro-Ukrainian side accused anyone who called for a diplomatic path of not caring about Ukrainian lives or sovereignty. They cheered on aggressive military assistance, arguing that even the meekest calls for negotiations were a gift to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe reality is that Ukraine’s war effort was never as stable as its Western supporters claimed.\n\nFrom the start, American lawmakers repeated the mantra that they would support Ukraine “for as long as it takes.” This was a deeply misleading promise. Wars are expensive, and America’s ability to finance them is determined by economic conditions, domestic politics, and shifting public sentiment. The political will to continue the war indefinitely was never sustainable, yet Ukrainian soldiers were sent into battle under the illusion that the U.S. would remain unwavering in its commitment.\n\nThe Biden administration’s Ukraine policy reflects a similar, if less explicit, mindset to Trump’s. Before Putin waged this war, there were offramps. A senior Biden official admitted the U.S. made no effort to negotiate on one of Putin’s top concerns before his invasion — Ukraine’s potential inclusion in NATO. When Kyiv and Moscow engaged in direct talks during the early weeks of the conflict, the U.S. and U.K. governments worked to undermine the negotiations, according to multiple reports.\n\nThe Biden administration also pressured Ukraine to lower its draft age from 25 to 18 to increase troop numbers and to deal “more aggressively” with the issue of having tens of thousands of soldiers who do not want to fight. Trump allies like Graham and national security adviser Mike Waltz have also pushed Ukraine to lower its draft age — calls that Zelensky has rejected and are politically unpopular among Ukrainians.\n\nPolicymakers in Washington never seriously reckoned with the immense human, economic, and social toll of the Ukraine war because they never had to. For them, it has always been a distant conflict, a tool to weaken Russia while positioning American interests in the region.\n\nTrump’s demand for “payback” from Ukraine — treating the bloodiest conflict in Europe since World War II as if it’s some unappreciated favor — presents U.S. foreign policy in its most naked form.\n\nAs a result of the West’s refusal to seriously consider diplomacy, Ukraine is left with impossible choices: fight a losing war without U.S. support, or submit to economic vassalage under the very powers that prolonged its suffering.",

        "full_text": "President Donald Trump’s pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and bilateral negotiations with Russia have spurred European leaders to offer promises to take charge of their own security and step up their defense commitments as they seek to keep the new administration engaged on the continent.\n\nLast week, President Trump shocked many European leaders when he appeared to blame Ukraine for provoking the war with Russia and labeled President Zelensky a “dictator” amid tense negotiations over a proposed mineral deal the administration views as a way for Ukraine to pay the United States back for its assistance.\n\nOne of President Trump’s chief negotiators, U.S. Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, echoed these sentiments later, telling CNN’s Jake Tapper last weekend that the war was provoked, “and that doesn’t necessarily mean that it was provoked by the Russians” and suggested that talks with Ukraine to one day join the NATO alliance may have been responsible.\n\n“That didn’t need to happen, it basically became a threat to the Russians,” Witkoff.\n\nA larger role\n\nMany European leaders reacted negatively to the Trump administration’s decision to meet with Russian negotiators last week in Saudi Arabia, warning that no lasting peace could be achieved by cutting the Europeans and Ukraine out of negotiations.\n\nOthers however tacked a different course. French President Emmanuel Macron, who traveled Washington, D.C. on Monday in an attempt to bridge the gap, is leading a European effort promising to take on a larger security role on the continent to convince the Americans to stay engaged in finding a lasting peace for the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nMacron visited the American capital on the heels of his own “emergency” European summit on how to end the three-year war in Ukraine. The meeting ended with no firm plans, but it helped forge a common message from European leaders. Macron brought assurances from the United States’ European allies that they are willing to do more to answer President Trump’s concerns, specifically about their own contribution to the continent’s defense.\n\nMacron reassured President Trump that Europe, and specifically France, shares the ultimate goal of peace in the Russia-Ukraine war. He also reiterated his warning that security guarantees for Ukraine are necessary for a “solid” peace, one that would stop conflict from erupting again after any brief pause in fighting.\n\n“I think our common objective…is to build peace and a solid and longstanding peace, and this is what we will discuss, obviously, because I have great respect for bravery and the resistance of Ukrainian people, and we do share the objective of peace, because we are very aware of the necessity to to have guarantees and solid peace in order to stabilize the situation,” Macron said after his meeting with Trump.\n\nMacron also said, on behalf of the European leaders, that Europe is willing to “step up to be a stronger partner, to do more in defense and security for this continent,” which Trump has long demanded since his first term in office.\n\n\"indifferent to the fate of Europe\"\n\nGermany's Friedrich Merz who is slated to be the next chancellor following the country’s elections on Sunday, said that it might be time for Europe to seek “independence” from the United States on defense.\n\n“After Donald Trump’s statements last week, it is clear that the Americans, at least this part of the Americans, this administration, are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe,” Merz said in an interview, according to Politico. In the past, Merz has proposed a new defense alliance, separate from NATO, as U.S. engagement in Europe declines.\n\n“We must prepare for the worst-case scenario,” he said. “One in which American engagement in European security significantly declines.” But Merz does not necessarily see this as an existential threat to Germany’s alliance with the United States.\n\nIn fact, Merz has floated several policies for Germany that may give Trump exactly what he wants: NATO allies that spend more on their own defense and take on a greater role in European security. For example, Merz has proposed a European security alliance separate from NATO that would take on issues vital to the continent’s security, but which are less important for the United States.\n\nMerz made clear that he does not believe that any European efforts should replace the longstanding alliance with the United States, however, stating in an interview that he believes a strong stand by a united Europe could keep the United States engaged.\n\n“Keeping our alliance with the U.S. intact is vital,” Merz said. “NATO is not just a military pact, it’s a political alliance built on shared values: democracy, open societies, and market economies. I sincerely hope we can continue to uphold these principles together.”\n\nItaly\n\nItaly’s leader Giorgia Meloni, a strong ideological ally of President Trump, invoked shared values in a virtual speech delivered directly to Trump’s core supporters gathered at the Conservative Political Action Conference last weekend near Washington, D.C. in which she urged conservatives to continue supporting Ukraine and work to secure a long-lasting peace with the cooperation of Europe.\n\n“You cannot defend your freedom if you lack the means or the courage to do so. Happiness depends on freedom and freedom depends on courage. We proved this when we stopped invasions, won our independences, and overthrew dictators,” Meloni said. “And we have done it together the last three years in Ukraine, where a proud people fight for their freedom against the brutal aggression.”\n\nMeloni said that achieving a “a just and lasting peace” requires it being “built with the contribution of all,” emphasizing that peace cannot be achieved without European cooperation.\n\nHer remarks also appeared to include a veiled warning to her ally, comparing a potential abandonment of Ukraine to President Biden’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, from which his administration never fully recovered.\n\n“And I know that with Donald Trump leading the United States we will never again see the disaster we saw in Afghanistan four years ago,” Meloni said.\n\nPeacekeeping forces\n\nFrance’s Macron and the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister Kier Starmer reportedly have begun to develop a plan that would see 30,000 European peacekeepers deployed to Ukraine if a ceasefire is signed with Russia, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn his meeting with Macron, Trump said he approved of the idea, likely seeing it as a way to provide security guarantees that Ukraine seeks without using U.S. troops directly. Macron and Starmer, who is set to visit Washington himself on Thursday, both believe that a U.S. “backstop” would be necessary to protect European troops in Ukraine and to deter Russia from violating a potential ceasefire.\n\nTrump gave no indication whether U.S. troops would be involved in the plan, but said he believed the European forces would be enough to secure the peace.\n\n“And a lot of the European countries, I think I don't want to speak for France, but I know that the [French] president's talked about doing that also, I think that'll be a very good day when we can go in as peacekeepers, as opposed to what's going on right now with everybody being killed,” Trump said.\n\n“And I don't think you're going to need much backing. I think that's not going to be a problem. Once an agreement is signed, Russia is going to get back to its business, and Ukraine and Europe are going to get back to their business. I don't think it's going to be a problem,” he said.",

        "full_text": "Billion Indians have no spending money - report\n\n2 days ago\n\nNikhil Inamdar, BBC News, Mumbai\n\nIndia is home to 1.4 billion people but around a billion lack money to spend on any discretionary goods or services, a new report estimates.\n\nThe country's consuming class, effectively the potential market for start-ups or business owners, is only about as big as Mexico, 130-140 million people, according to the report from Blume Ventures, a venture capital firm.\n\nAnother 300 million are \"emerging\" or \"aspirant\" consumers but they are reluctant spenders who have only just begun to open their purse strings, as click-of-a-button digital payments make it easy to transact.\n\nWhat is more, the consuming class in Asia's third largest economy is not \"widening\" as much as it is \"deepening\", according to the report. That basically means India's wealthy population is not really growing in numbers, even though those who are already rich are getting even wealthier.\n\nAll of this is shaping the country's consumer market in distinct ways, particularly accelerating the trend of \"premiumisation\" where brands drive growth by doubling down on expensive, upgraded products catering to the wealthy, rather than focusing on mass-market offerings.\n\nThis is evident in zooming sales of ultra-luxury gated housing and premium phones, even as their lower-end variants struggle. Affordable homes now constitute just 18% of India's overall market compared with 40% five years ago. Branded goods are also capturing a bigger share of the market. And the \"experience economy\" is booming, with expensive tickets for concerts by international artists like Coldplay and Ed Sheeran selling like hot cakes.\n\nWhy global stars like Coldplay and Ed Sheeran are hitting India\n\nCompanies that have adapted to these shifts have thrived, Sajith Pai, one of the report's authors, told the BBC. \"Those who are too focused at the mass end or have a product mix that doesn't have exposure to the premium end have lost market share.\"\n\nThe report's findings bolster the long-held view that India's post-pandemic recovery has been K-shaped - where the rich have got richer, while the poor have lost purchasing power.\n\nIn fact, this has been a long-term structural trend that began even before the pandemic. India has been getting increasingly more unequal, with the top 10% of Indians now holding 57.7% of national income compared with 34% in 1990. The bottom half have seen their share of national income fall from 22.2% to 15%.\n\nThe latest consumption slump, however, has deepened amid not just a destruction in purchasing power, but also a precipitous drop in financial savings and surging indebtedness among the masses.\n\nThe country's central bank has also cracked down on easy unsecured lending that propped up demand after the Covid pandemic.\n\nMuch of the consumption spending of the \"emerging\" or \"aspirant\" class of Indians was led by such borrowing and \"turning off that tap will definitely have some impact on consumption\", says Pai.\n\nIn the short run, two things are expected to help boost spending - a pick-up in rural demand on the back of a record harvest and a $12 billion tax give-away in the recently concluded budget. It will not be \"dramatic\" but could boost India's GDP - largely driven by consumption - by over half a percent, says Pai.\n\nBut major longer-term headwinds remain.\n\nIndia's middle class - which has been a major engine for consumer demand - is being squeezed out, with wages pretty much staying flat, according to data compiled by Marcellus Investment Managers.\n\n\"The middle 50% of India's tax-paying population has seen its income stagnate in absolute terms over the past decade. This implies a halving of income in real terms [adjusted for inflation],\" says the report, published in January.\n\n\"This financial hammering has decimated the middle class's savings - the RBI [Reserve Bank of India] has repeatedly highlighted that net financial savings of Indian households are approaching a 50-year low. This pounding suggests that products and services associated with middle-class household spending are likely to face a rough time in the years ahead,\" it adds.\n\nThe Marcellus report also points out that white-collar urban jobs are becoming harder to come by as artificial intelligence automates clerical, secretarial and other routine work. \"The number of supervisors employed in manufacturing units [as a percentage of all employed] in India has gone down significantly,\" it adds.\n\nThe government's recent economic survey has flagged these concerns as well.\n\nIt says labour displacement as a result of these technological advancements is of particular concern for a mainly services-driven economy like India, where a significant share of the IT workforce is employed in low value-added services sectors that are most prone to disruption.\n\n\"India is also a consumption-based economy, thus the fall in consumption that can result from the displacement of its workforce is bound to have macroeconomic implications. If the worst-case projections materialise, this could have the potential to set the country's economic growth trajectory off course,\" the survey says.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "full_text": "Apple users in the United Kingdom will no longer have access to a key data security feature for iCloud storage: Advanced Data Protection. It’s a relatively small change, but privacy experts worry it could have ripple effects for data privacy around the world.\n\nThe iPhone maker confirmed last week that it would end access for UK users to the optional end-to-end encryption feature, which helps to ensure that only users can access their own personal data, such as photos and messages.\n\nThe move was widely viewed as an effort to avoid complying with a request from the British government for a technical “back door” to access user data. Still, the situation could serve as an example that other governments could follow to undermine user privacy, experts say.\n\n“This has always been one of our major concerns,” said Caroline Wilson, general counsel at UK-based nonprofit Privacy International. “The fact that the UK government… is setting a bad precedent for other governments around the world.”\n\nApple said in a statement that it is “gravely disappointed” to no longer offer the feature to UK users, “given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy.”\n\nBut the company had little choice, experts say.\n\n“Apple was in a very difficult spot here,” said John Verdi, senior vice president of policy at Washington, DC-based advocacy group Future of Privacy Forum. “Folks in the United Kingdom simply will not have available the top level of security that Apple provides elsewhere in the world.”\n\nWhat is Advanced Data Protection?\n\nApple’s iCloud storage service uses end-to-end encryption to protect 14 categories of sensitive data by default, including health data and passwords, stored in users’ iCloud Keychain.\n\nThat means user data is basically scrambled when it’s stored on Apple’s servers, and only the user who holds the account can access it in its un-scrambled form. So, no one with access to Apple’s servers — like hackers, or even the company itself — could read users’ sensitive data.\n\n“In the digital world, end-to-end encryption is going to be your best bet for getting a truly private and secure conversation that’s kind of on the level of what you could have in person,” said Joe Mullin, a senior policy analyst for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nAdvanced Data Protection, or ADP, extends end-to-end encryption for additional categories of data, including photos, notes, voice memos and iCloud backups (think text messages and call logs). So, in the event of a data breach, for example, content like this would be inaccessible to a hacker since even Apple can’t read it.\n\n“One of the very few ways to make sure that your data can’t be leaked if a company is breached is to make sure that the company (itself) doesn’t have it,” said Sarah Scheffler, an assistant professor in Carnegie Mellon’s Cylab Security and Privacy Institute.\n\nUK users will now lose protection for those additional categories of data. Those who have not already enabled ADP are no longer able to do so, and Apple says it will soon provide guidance to existing users on how to disable the feature.\n\nThere are third-party cloud storage options that offer end-to-end encryption, like NordLocker and Proton Drive. But Mullin notes that consumers are less likely to use them because they’d have to go through extra steps, whereas Apple’s system can back up your phone automatically when it’s locked and connected to power and Wi-Fi.\n\n“You kind of need these encrypted services on some level from the people that are making the (operating system) on your phone,” said Mullin. “That’s why so much of the encryption conversation is around what Google and Apple are doing.”\n\nAdvanced Data Protection will still be available outside of the UK. For UK users, those standard end-to-end encrypted data categories will not change, and iMessage and FaceTime will remain end-to-end encrypted.\n\n“It’s a shame,” Verdi said. “It makes British citizens less safe.”\n\nThe UK fight over data access\n\nApple’s move comes weeks after multiple news outlets reported that British security officials had ordered Apple to build a technical back door that would allow access to the company’s global user data. The demand reportedly came under the Investigatory Powers Act, which lets British law enforcement compel access to communications and metadata from tech companies in secret.\n\nApple has built its brand around privacy and previously resisted building back doors to allow governments or law enforcement access to its users’ information.\n\n“As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will,” the company said in a statement regarding the change to ADP.\n\nBut without end-to-end encryption, Apple could have access to users’ data, which means law enforcement could legally compel the company to hand it over to aid in the investigation and prosecution of crimes. That may be why Apple believes the move to end ADP in the region will be enough for the British government.\n\n“The decision to pull this privacy feature in the UK is an attempt to hopefully not undermine it in the rest of the world,” Wilson said.\n\nApple has declined to comment directly on the British demand. The UK’s Home Office, which is responsible for making requests under the Investigatory Powers Act, did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nA broader security threat\n\nBut even if it makes it easier for law enforcement to access user data, it’s “impossible to provide exceptional access” to data for some parties without “undermining security for everyone,” Verdi said.\n\n“Either everyone is protected by strong encryption, or it’s weakened for everyone,” he said.\n\nHe added that law enforcement could instead seek to access data directly from, with a warrant that compels them to unlock their devices.\n\nIn the wake of the UK’s move, Verdi says he sees “two possible futures.” In one scenario, other governments could decide they want to do the opposite of the UK and give individuals, companies and government officials the “best security Apple has to offer,” boosting encryption protections. But some governments could also follow the UK’s lead and “seek to undermine security” by passing rules or making demands that force tech companies to weaken their encryption.\n\n“What happens now?” said Scheffler. “This is one piece in a very large puzzle over… the future of privacy, and the future security and the future of encryption.”",

        "full_text": "Speaker Mike Johnson pulled off a stunning turnaround Tuesday night to rescue a critical vote to advance President Donald Trump’s agenda that had seemed doomed just moments earlier.\n\nSurprising even some of his critics, Johnson and his leadership team capped hours of drama in the Capitol by successfully flipping multiple Republican holdouts to pass a budget blueprint that will mark the first step toward moving Trump’s ambitious agenda forward. With help from last-minute phone calls from Trump, GOP leaders spent all of Tuesday in a furious pressure campaign to win backing for their plan.\n\n“The world didn’t end today. But I do see the edge,” Rep. Pat Fallon, a Texas Republican, said of the whiplash in the House.\n\nRepublicans had punted the vote Tuesday night only to turn around minutes later to call fleeing members back to the floor to muscle through the plan.\n\nIn the end, Johnson lost just a single vote — fiscal hawk Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky — which was all he could afford. The Democrats’ whip team scrambled to get near-full attendance on their side: Rep. Brittany Pettersen flew with her 4-week-old baby to make it in time for the vote and Rep. Kevin Mullin, who is recovering from complications from knee surgery, flew with an IV from California.\n\nBut the drama won’t end there: Johnson and his allies acknowledge that what comes next will be much more difficult. Tuesday night’s vote itself was procedural and GOP leaders from the House and Senate will need to agree on how exactly to move ahead with Trump’s sprawling legislative package now that they have adopted divergent plans. The days-long saga over the House budget blueprint laid bare bitter divisions among Republicans that will make it extraordinarily difficult to pass that package in both chambers.\n\nStill, the win comes at a critical time for Trump and Johnson as their party faces crushing deadlines ahead, including avoiding a government shutdown next month and the threat of an economic default later this spring. As with Tuesday night’s vote, navigating those political landmines will require near total unity from the GOP.\n\nGOP leaders will now get to work on exactly what will make it into Trump’s first legislative package. The newly passed House GOP plan calls for sweeping tax cuts, steep spending cuts and a two-year debt limit hike, as well as new money for border security and energy production. The Senate’s plan, however, contains only national security and energy money, while punting on the more contentious items for later.\n\nThe stakes are high for GOP leaders: Trump is eager to pass his agenda as quickly as possible, even as party leaders must comply with the extremely strict constraints of the budget powers that allow their party to pass a package without Democratic votes. And Republicans will need to tread carefully on reforms to popular programs like Medicaid, food assistance and Pell grants — concerns that nearly sunk the budget plan this week.\n\nThe successful vote capped a dramatic 12 hours for Johnson. In the morning, he held a tense meeting with House Republicans to convince his members to back the budget blueprint or risk forgoing key parts of Trump’s agenda.\n\nBut by the afternoon, House GOP leaders were still struggling to lock down the votes, and even the relentlessly upbeat Johnson acknowledged he may need to pull it.\n\nThe votes weren’t there around 7:30 p.m., when the speaker moved to scrap plans to hold the vote at all. But then his leadership team — with help from a Trump call to Rep. Victoria Spartz — was able to win over the last holdouts. So, just moments after dismissing members, Johnson called them back to vote and passed the GOP’s budget blueprint.\n\nRep. Warren Davidson, an Ohio Republican, said he decided to change his vote after he received “assurances” of a future plan that could survive the Senate to trim discretionary spending, though he offered no specifics.\n\nAnd Spartz added that she spoke with Trump on health care issues, saying, “He’s on board to get some great things done on health care. … I trust his word.”\n\n“I think the last few weeks are showing us how difficult it is to move any package through the House,” Rep. Dusty Johnson, a leadership ally, acknowledged earlier Tuesday. “This is a motley crew.”\n\nHours before the scheduled vote, hardline conservatives insisted there weren’t enough spending cuts in the plan, even as centrist-leaning Republicans remained uneasy about the size of those cuts and whether they could impact popular programs like Medicaid. And Johnson’s efforts to win support even backfired in some corners. Massie said he left a meeting Tuesday morning even more dug in against the budget than before.\n\n“They convinced me in there, I’m a no,” the Kentucky Republican said, holding up a thick packet of leadership talking points and railing against their plans line by line. By the time of the vote, Massie remained the only GOP “no.”\n\nJohnson and his whip team had spent the last several days trying to win over their more moderate members, many of whom had raised concerns that the budget plan could ultimately lead to cuts to the low-income health program Medicaid.\n\nAhead of the vote, Republicans from northeastern states were particularly wary of plans to cut $880 billion over a decade from federal health and energy programs, which they fear cannot be achieved without cutting Medicaid, the hugely expensive health program, since Trump has vowed not to touch Medicare.\n\nGOP leaders have strongly pushed back against the idea that benefits would be cut, noting that the budget plan is only a framework and not specific policy. They argue there are ways to cut hundreds of billions in wasted money on federal health programs without slashing Medicaid benefits, though it remains unclear where those cuts would come from.\n\n“This is a procedural vote. You tell me what the cuts are,” House Majority Whip Tom Emmer told CNN when asked about swing seat lawmakers’ concerns about Medicaid cuts.\n\nIn the end, Johnson only recorded a single Republican defection.\n\n“We will get there, as we always do,” the speaker predicted earlier in the day, when he was still lacking at least a half-dozen votes.\n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN’s Manu Raju, Alison Main, Morgan Rimmer, Veronica Stracqualursi and Aileen Graef contributed to this report.",

        "full_text": "Summary Companies House narrowly approves move to advance $4.5 trillion tax-cut plan Hardline Republicans sought deeper spending cuts Swing district lawmakers concerned about impact on social programs WASHINGTON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives late on Tuesday advanced President Donald Trump 's tax-cut and border security agenda, delivering a major boost to his 2025 priorities. The vote on passage was 217-215 with Representative Thomas Massie, a prominent fiscal hawk, as a lone Republican voting in opposition, and no Democrats supporting the controversial measure. One Democrat did not vote. The measure is a preliminary step to extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts later this year. Tuesday's vote sent the budget resolution to the Senate, where Republicans are expected to take it up. \"We have a lot of hard work ahead of us, but we are going to deliver the American First agenda,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters after the vote. \"We're going to celebrate tonight, and we'll roll up our sleeves and get right back in the morning.\" The final vote came after Johnson and No. 2 House Republican Steve Scalise spent hours persuading holdouts to back the move. The measure's passage followed an unusual series of maneuvers in which Johnson canceled a vote on the bill, because it lacked the votes for passage, and then promptly reversed course. Both leaders said Trump himself had been contacting reluctant members about the need to advance the $4.5 trillion tax-cut plan, which would also fund the deportation of migrants living in the U.S. illegally, tighten border security, energy deregulation and military spending.

REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz/File Photo Speaker of the House Mike Johnson speaks during a House Republican members conference meeting in Trump National Doral resort, in Miami, Florida, U.S. January 27, 2025. REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz/File Photo , Several hardline conservatives sought deeper spending cuts and stronger control over separate government funding legislation to avert a potential shutdown after current funding expires on March 14. Three Republican hardliners seen initially as firm no votes - Tim Burchett, Victoria Spartz and Warren Davidson - wound up voting for the measure in the end. Doubts about House Republican unity prompted Senate Republicans to enact their own budget resolution as a Plan B ploy last week: a $340 billion measure that covers Trump's border, defense and energy priorities but leaves the thornier issue of tax policy for later in the year. Both chambers need to pass the same budget resolution to unlock a parliamentary tool that Republicans will need later this year to circumvent Democratic opposition and the Senate filibuster and enact legislation containing the Trump agenda. The House budget seeks $2 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years to pay for Trump's agenda. The tax cuts Trump is seeking would extend breaks passed during his first term in office, his main legislative accomplishment, that are due to expire at the end of this year. Passing a budget resolution is just the first deadline facing lawmakers in the coming months. Lawmakers also need to enact fiscal 2025 spending legislation to keep federal agencies operating after current funding expires on March 14. Later this year they will need to act on the federal government's self-imposed debt ceiling or risk triggering catastrophic default on its $36 trillion in debt.

        "full_text": "The eventual ruling in the case, Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services, could determine whether so-called reverse discrimination claims should be evaluated under the same standards as those brought by historically marginalized groups.\n\nWhat is the legal issue before the Supreme Court?\n\nAt the heart of the case is the “background circumstances” rule, a legal test used by some federal courts when majority-group plaintiffs, such as white or straight employees, bring discrimination claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This rule requires these plaintiffs to prove that their employer is “that unusual employer who discriminates against the majority.”\n\nMarlean Ames, a former Ohio Department of Youth Services employee and plaintiff in the case, argues that the rule makes it significantly harder for white and straight workers to bring discrimination lawsuits. Ames claims she was passed over for a promotion and later demoted in favor of less-qualified gay employees, a complaint that was rejected by two lower courts beneath the highest.\n\nAmes sued in the Southern District of Ohio, but her case was dismissed for failing to meet the background circumstances rule. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal, acknowledging her discrimination claim was plausible since she was demoted and replaced by gay employees but ruling that she failed to meet the extra burden required for majority-group plaintiffs.\n\nHowever, several other circuit courts have chosen not to apply the background circumstances rule in discrimination cases, creating a split beckoning the nine justices to bring clarity to the issue. The Supreme Court is now set to resolve a circuit split on whether the background circumstances rule should remain in place during an oral argument hearing at 10 a.m. local time.\n\nHow does this case relate to the Supreme Court’s recent rulings on discrimination?\n\nThe case marks another major fight over discrimination since the Supreme Court’s landmark 2023 ruling in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard/UNC, which struck down race-based affirmative action in college admissions as a violation of the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause.\n\nThat decision held that eliminating discrimination means eliminating it entirely, a principle Ames and her supporters argue should apply equally to employment law.\n\nThe Equal Protection Project, led by Legal Insurrection founder William Jacobson, argues in an amicus brief that “reverse discrimination is no longer unusual; it is unfortunately alive and well.”\n\nThe brief states that discrimination against white and straight employees has become “ubiquitous,” particularly under corporate DEI initiatives, and that they should not be subject to a higher legal burden.\n\nWhat are the arguments supporting Ames?\n\nAmes and her supporters argue that the background circumstances rule unfairly places a higher burden on majority-group plaintiffs, making it harder for them to challenge workplace discrimination.\n\nAmerica First Legal, which has filed numerous lawsuits against DEI policies, argues that “nothing in Title VII supports a higher burden for ‘majority’ employees who claim discrimination.”\n\nWhat are the arguments against Ames?\n\nThe Ohio Department of Youth Services defends the background circumstances test as a necessary tool for evaluating discrimination claims fairly. The department warns that eliminating this requirement could open the floodgates to lawsuits challenging diversity policies and complicate efforts to enforce employment laws.\n\nIn December, former Biden administration Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar led an amicus brief in support of the department, arguing, “The district court did not apply the ‘background circumstances’ requirement to Ames’s claim that she was demoted because she is a woman.”\n\nA coalition of civil rights organizations, including the NAACP, argues that courts must consider the history of systemic inequality in employment discrimination cases. “Majority-group plaintiffs cannot rely on the same legacy of discrimination to support their claims,” their amicus brief states. The NAACP contends that eliminating the background circumstances rule could make it harder to address long-standing disparities in hiring and promotion.\n\nWhat stands to change if Ames wins?\n\nA ruling in favor of Ames could make it significantly easier for nonminority employees to bring viable discrimination complaints against employers, depending on the circumstances of their claims.\n\nAPPLE SHAREHOLDERS REJECT OVERHAULING DEI PROGRAM’S ‘ILLEGAL DISCRIMINATION’\n\nIn turn, a favorable ruling for Ames could reshape workplace diversity initiatives and make DEI policies more legally vulnerable, as conservative groups saw as a logical next step with the undoing of affirmative action for college admissions two years ago.\n\nWith the Supreme Court’s Republican-appointed majority having already dismantled affirmative action in college admissions, Ames v. Ohio could become another defining decision in the legal battles over race, gender, and workplace discrimination.",

        "full_text": "In his opening weeks back in office, President Trump is asserting power in a way that pushes hard on, and sometimes past, the boundaries of executive authority.\n\nOne of the most important of those boundaries involves his relationship with independent regulatory agencies. Mr. Trump is the first president since the 1930s to assert control over many of them, and this assertion of power will almost certainly be tested in the Supreme Court.\n\nMr. Trump is operating under the theory that the executive branch is unitary, in the sense that Article II of the Constitution places executive power in a single person, the president, who gets to control every high-level official who executes federal law (and plenty of lower-level ones, too).\n\nIf Mr. Trump succeeds in court, the country will see a significant shift in power from the independent agencies to the White House.\n\nFor better or for worse, that shift would be profoundly unsettling. And in some respects it could be dangerous — if, for example, a president is allowed to control monetary policy, or if he is in charge of the Federal Communications Commission, and thus able to play politics with national communications policy.\n\nThe president is not a king. In its most extreme version, the unitary executive theory is a form of invented history, a modern creation that threatens to change, and in important ways to undermine, the operations of the national government.\n\nThe theory of the unitary executive means that the president can fire, at his pleasure, the heads of the Federal Trade Commission, the National Labor Relations Board and other independent agencies. In its strongest form, the unitary executive theory means that the president can control the policy choices of those agencies. So if the F.T.C. wants to issue a rule to protect consumers, and the president thinks that’s a terrible idea, then he can prevent that rule from seeing the light of day.\n\nThe unitary executive theory is supported by some distinguished scholars, who point to the Constitution’s text. The first sentence of Article II states that “the executive power shall be vested in a president of the United States of America.” The same article gives the president, and no one else, the power to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.”\n\nEveryone agrees that at the Constitutional Convention, the founders decided to have just one president, rather than a “plural” executive. Practically everyone also agrees that the very first Congress, in creating the departments of Treasury, War and Foreign Affairs, made a momentous decision, widely known as the Decision of 1789: Their heads would be at-will employees of the president. The Decision of 1789 is often thought to show acceptance of the unitary executive theory.\n\nThe current conflict over the president’s authority owes its origins to the New Deal period. In a 1935 case, Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, the court ruled that Congress could limit the president’s power to remove a head of the F.T.C. — and thus that it could create independent agencies.\n\nUntil recently, many people agreed that under Humphrey’s Executor, independent agencies are just fine under the law, and that the president does not have much authority over them. In the early 1980s, I worked in the Justice Department under President Ronald Reagan, whose White House liked the idea of a unitary executive and who wanted to know if he could exert at least some control over the independent agencies.\n\nLawyers in the Justice Department decided that Humphrey’s Executor was settled law — but that it left the president some running room. If he wanted, we said, he could direct independent agencies to submit their regulations to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, the president’s regulatory clearinghouse, for a degree of scrutiny and review. We did not think that the president could tell the independent agencies what rules to issue, but we did think that he could require them to subject their rules to a process of comment and analysis by the regulatory office.\n\nReagan decided not to impose that requirement, partly because of the seriousness of the legal question, and partly because of fear of a fierce congressional pushback.\n\nIn the past four decades, both Republican and Democratic presidents have followed Reagan’s lead. To be sure, they have overseen internal discussions about whether to assert the unitariness of the executive and to require independent agencies to submit their rules to the O.I.R.A.\n\nI was administrator of O.I.R.A. from 2009 to 2012, and the issue came up. The White House’s ultimate judgment was that presidential control would not be a good idea. Some government lawyers thought it would raise serious legal doubts. Other White House officials thought that, for one thing, independent agencies avoided an excessive concentration of power in one person. For another, such agencies reduced the risk of self-dealing (as might occur if, for example, a president rewarded his friends and punished his enemies).\n\nMore recently, the Supreme Court has shown a distinct discomfort with the whole idea of independent agencies. In Seila Law v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, decided in 2020, the court struck down a provision making the bureau independent on the ground that it was headed by a single person. The court purported to preserve Humphrey’s Executor and the multimember independent agencies (like the F.C.C., the N.L.R.B. and the Fed). But at the same time, the court spoke enthusiastically about the unitary executive, and it is reasonable to doubt whether Humphrey’s Executor will ultimately survive.\n\nPresident Trump does not like the idea of independent agencies. He recently fired a member of the N.L.R.B., even though board members can be discharged, under the law, only for “neglect of duty or malfeasance in office, but for no other cause.”\n\nHis acting solicitor general has said that the Justice Department intends to contest the for-cause protections given to the F.T.C., the N.L.R.B. and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. (Why she singled out those three agencies is not entirely clear.)\n\nThe acting solicitor general also said that in certain contexts, the department will contest the idea of independent administrative law judges — adjudicators within the executive branch who do not serve at the president’s pleasure.\n\nAnd the president has directed the independent agencies to submit their rules for O.I.R.A. review, reversing the course set by Reagan and presidential administrations since.\n\nMr. Trump may ultimately win in court, but the best historical research throws the whole idea of a unitary executive into serious doubt. In the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton, who rejected a plural executive, also insisted that the president lacks unlimited removal power.\n\nAnd defenders of the unitary executive appear to have misunderstood the Decision of 1789. The most careful evidence suggests that, at the time, a majority of members of Congress did not embrace but actually rejected the view that Congress lacks power to protect subordinate officials in the executive branch from presidential control. Indeed, independent agencies are hardly a creation of the New Deal — they have been with us since the founding era.\n\nIt follows that if you are an originalist, you will probably reject Mr. Trump’s broadest claims.\n\nThen there’s stare decisis, or precedent. The Trump administration’s claims would upset law that has been settled for 90 years. It’s true that the current court has not always respected stare decisis, but it has yet to undertake the kind of radical revision of national institutions that would come from invalidating independent agencies.\n\nRequiring some independent agencies to submit their rules to O.I.R.A. would hardly be the end of the world. It could even do some good. O.I.R.A.’s staffers do a thorough, careful job, and agency regulations are usually improved by the process of review. It would not be unreasonable for the Supreme Court to allow the White House and the regulatory office to comment on, and have some degree of control over, the regulations of most of the independent agencies.\n\nBut the case of the Fed puts a bright spotlight on the potential danger of giving the president unlimited authority over independent agencies. There are strong reasons for its independence. If a president could control interest rates, or oversee regulations that are connected to monetary policy, he could manage the economy so as to promote his own short-term political interests.\n\nOr take the F.C.C. A president who oversees its decisions could punish news sources that he didn’t like and reward those he loved.\n\nOr consider the claim that the president gets to impound congressionally appropriated funds and choose which ones to spend. That claim would render Congress subordinate to the executive in what might be its most fundamental power: the purse. Impoundment authority, on the part of the president, would go well beyond the idea of a unitary executive. It would be a devastating blow to the separation of powers.\n\nThere are decent arguments in favor of reforms that would increase presidential control over the administrative state. But the broadest current claims about executive authority are a creation of the 21st century, not the 18th. They are a form of hubris. They strike at the heart of our founding document.",

        "full_text": "FBI leadership is starting an investigation into the origins of the agency’s plan a decade ago to infiltrate the campaign of presidential candidate Donald Trump using two female undercover “honeypot” agents.\n\nThe off-the-books investigation, launched in 2015 by FBI Director James B. Comey, was revealed by an agency whistleblower in a protected disclosure to the House Judiciary Committee last year and first reported exclusively by The Washington Times in October.\n\nIn the intelligence community, a honeypot commonly refers to an undercover operative, usually a woman, who feigns sexual or romantic interest to obtain information from a target.\n\nThe whistleblower said two female FBI undercover employees infiltrated Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign at high levels and were directed to act as “honeypots” while traveling with Mr. Trump and his campaign staff.\n\nThe Times has learned that the bureau, now led by Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino, is looking for those once-undercover employees under Mr. Comey’s direction.\n\nThe FBI declined to comment.\n\nAccording to the whistleblower disclosure, which The Times reviewed, the investigation differed from Crossfire Hurricane, a later FBI counterintelligence operation that looked into never-proved allegations that the campaign was colluding with Russia.\n\nThe whistleblower said the early off-the-books criminal investigation targeted Mr. Trump and his staff.\n\nMr. Trump launched his presidential campaign on June 16, 2015, about a year before the FBI opened Crossfire Hurricane.\n\nThe whistleblower agent “personally knew” that Mr. Comey ordered an FBI investigation into Mr. Trump and that Mr. Comey “personally directed it,” according to the disclosure.\n\nThe investigation did not appear to target a specific crime but was more of what agents would describe as a fishing expedition to find anything incriminating against Mr. Trump.\n\nThe whistleblower said the undercover operation was obscured from Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz, who investigated misconduct in the bureau’s probe of the Trump campaign.\n\n“The case had no predicated foundation, so Comey personally directed the investigation without creating an official case file in Sentinel or any other FBI system,” according to the whistleblower’s disclosure. “The FBI has multiple methods of protecting highly sensitive investigations, so Comey did not have a legitimate reason not to officially create an official investigation file or have a file number.”\n\nThe disclosure says the secret investigation may have indicated institutional bias at the FBI against Mr. Trump, though “it does not appear that any information about this investigation was turned over to Trump’s criminal defense counsels.”\n\nThe investigation was eventually closed because a major newspaper obtained a photograph of one of the undercovers and was about to publish it, but the FBI press office told the outlet that the photograph was an FBI informant who would be killed if the photograph was publicly released.\n\nIn fact, it was a photograph of the FBI undercover employee.\n\nThe FBI whistleblower employee noted in the disclosure that one of the undercovers agreed to be transferred to the CIA so she would not be available as a potential witness.\n\nThe other undercover employee was rewarded for her activities through a promotion in the bureau and is now a high-level FBI executive in a major field office.\n\nThe whistleblower employee observed one or more employees in the FBI being directed to never discuss the operation with anyone ever again, including other people involved in the 2016 Trump campaign infiltration operation.",

Instead, he said, there was probably software code somewhere on Apple’s systems that caused iPhones to write the word “Trump” when someone said “racist.”\n\n“This smells like a serious prank,” Mr. Burkey said. “The only question is: Did someone slip this into the data or slip into the code?”\n\nThe issue was the latest stumble at Apple since the company introduced a new A.I. system last year called Apple Intelligence.

        "full_text": "“We’re going to celebrate tonight,” Johnson told reporters after the vote, adding that House Republicans will “roll up their sleeves” as they prepared to reconcile their plans with the Senate.\n\nTuesday night’s vote came after a wild scene on the House floor that played out over the course of hours. Around 6:30 p.m. members were called to the floor to begin voting on an unrelated measure, with the budget plan to follow. But that unrelated vote was held open for more than an hour as the GOP whip team worked to win over the holdouts.\n\nDemocrats screamed “regular order” as the planned 15-minute vote stretched on and on. Shortly after 7:30 p.m., the vote was closed and members were informed the budget vote was canceled. Minutes later, leaders sent out another alert saying the vote was back on.\n\nThe holdouts included Reps. Tim Burchett of Tennessee, Warren Davidson of Ohio, and Victoria Spartz of Indiana, as well as Massie. All four voiced public opposition to the budget plan Tuesday and could be seen on the House floor during the evening vote series speaking to various Republican leaders.\n\nThe fiscal hawks all raised objections about inadequate spending cuts in the measure; Davidson also aired concerns about how Republican leaders plan to handle the impending March 14 government funding deadline.\n\nTrump spoke over the phone at various points with several of the holdouts, according to two Republicans familiar with the whip effort — Johnson later said the calls were “a big help.” Because of the House GOP’s tiny majority and the united opposition of Democrats, those four members could together block action.\n\nBut Johnson and Trump managed to win them over, one by one.\n\nSpartz said in a online post that she came around because Trump had a “personal commitment to save healthcare and make it better for physical and fiscal health for all Americans. ... I trust his word.”\n\nDavidson said in his own post that he “finally received the assurances I needed that there will be cuts to discretionary spending” ahead of the March funding deadline “and that we will work together to develop a plan for further discretionary spending cuts that could survive passage in the Senate.”\n\nAnd Burchett told reporters that Trump “committed to me that he is going to go after the spending in a lot of these big departments” and that more generally Republicans are “going in the right direction.”\n\n“It’s not everything I wanted, but in this game, you’re either at the table or on the menu,” he said. “It’s time to get at the table.”\n\nOnly Massie remained unconvinced.\n\nMeanwhile, a different faction of the GOP conference — moderate Republicans, many representing swing districts — had aired qualms about the scale of the Medicaid cuts implied by the budget plan.\n\nThat group, however, quickly softened: On Monday night, some said that a presentation from House leaders had moved them closer to supporting the budget plan, and by midday Tuesday, House leaders were confident enough to move toward a final vote.\n\nAfter it was all over, top Democratic leaders said Republicans had betrayed Americans by advancing a plan that they said would cut taxes for the richest while cutting benefits for the poor and middle class.\n\n“They chose their billionaire puppet masters over the American people,” said Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. “Democrats were unified, and we will remain unified throughout this process, because this reckless Republican budget will bring nothing but destruction to the American people.”\n\nSeveral Democrats who have faced health challenges and missed recent House votes rushed back to Washington for the budget showdown. That forced Johnson to scrounge up every vote he could.\n\nTuesday’s vote sets up a harsh reality check between House and Senate Republicans, who all want to push the president’s agenda forward but still have profoundly different approaches to key issues.\n\nThe Senate, for instance, is looking to avoid the deep cuts to Medicaid that the House is leaning on for significant cost cutting. Senate Republicans are also insisting that they won’t support a final measure that only extends Trump’s 2017 tax cuts temporarily. That could require making significant changes to the House blueprint, putting the fragile GOP support for the measure in jeopardy.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune congratulated the House GOP “for moving our team one step closer to advancing the president’s agenda” while also calling for a permanent extension to the Trump tax cuts — a goal that will be difficult to carry out under the House budget plan.\n\nThe House and Senate must adopt identical budget resolutions to unlock the power of reconciliation — which allows parties with unified control of Congress and the White House to pass massive policy bills along party lines, sidestepping the Senate filibuster.",

        "full_text": "Republican lawmakers are sounding the alarm over the Trump administration’s pointed refusal to blame Russia for starting the war in Ukraine, and they are highly skeptical about negotiating any lasting peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom some describe as a war criminal.\n\nThe Republican criticism of President Trump’s strategy for ending the war in Ukraine comes after the United States voted with Russia and its allies, such as North Korea and Belarus, against a United Nations resolution condemning Russian aggression toward Ukraine and calling for the withdrawal of its troops from the country.\n\nWhile GOP senators were willing to grant Trump broad deference on his controversial Cabinet nominees, they are doubling down in blaming Russia for starting the war and warning the president to approach Putin warily in any negotiation.\n\nSenate Appropriations Committee Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) blasted the American opposition to the U.N. resolution condemning Russian aggression.\n\n“Yesterday’s vote by the U.S. against the U.N. resolution was shameful,” she said Tuesday.\n\nThe measure, which received the backing of NATO allies, passed the U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly despite the U.S. opposition.\n\nThe United States instead backed a resolution that called for immediate peace in Ukraine but made no mention of Russia’s invasion for starting the conflict.\n\nCollins said she agreed with Sen. Mitch McConnell’s (R-Ky.) statement marking the third anniversary of the war, in which the former Senate GOP leader said refusing to blame Russia “as the undeniable and unprovoked aggressor” in the conflict “reflects a gross misunderstanding of the nature of negotiations and leverage.”\n\nSen. John Curtis (R-Utah) said he was “deeply troubled” that the U.S. voted Monday with Russia and North Korea and against traditional allies such as Britain and France, which supported the resolution condemning Russia and calling for a restoration of Ukraine’s borders.\n\n“I was deeply troubled by the vote at the UN today, which puts us on the same side as Russia and North Korea. These are not our friends. This posture is a dramatic shift from American ideals of freedom and democracy,” Curtis said in a post on social media.\n\nHe warned that any end to the war “must be achieved on terms that ensure Ukraine’s sovereignty and security” and “deter” Putin from future territorial aggression.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) on Tuesday marked the third anniversary of Russia’s “unprovoked war on Ukraine.”\n\n“We all want this senseless war to end, but ending it on Russia’s terms would be a devastating mistake that plays right into Putin’s bloody hands,” Murkowski posted on social media.\n\nShe later noted Trump has “the authority” to pursue a peace deal but warned that any such deal would be “unacceptable” if Putin sets the terms.\n\n“The president clearly has the ability, has the authority to be negotiating. But I think many of us have suggested that negotiating peace on Putin’s terms is not acceptable,” she told reporters.\n\nSome of the strongest pushback in the conference came from McConnell, who now leads the Senate’s Appropriations defense subcommittee.\n\n“America is right to seek an end to this war, but an end that fails to constrain Russian ambition, ensure Ukrainian sovereignty or strengthen American credibility with both allies and adversaries is no end at all. Instead, such a hollow peace would invite further aggression,” he said in a statement Monday.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said he “disagreed” with the U.S. vote against the resolution condemning Russian aggression.\n\n“Putin is a murderer who’s ordered the systematic capture, kidnapping, rape and torture of countless numbers of Ukrainians,” he said. “That would have been my vote recommendation.”\n\nHe argued Putin can’t be trusted to uphold any peace deal, a warning echoed by other GOP lawmakers.\n\n“Putin’s a liar and looking for the next opportunity to continue [Russia’s] march through Moldova and the west Balkans and everything else,” he warned.\n\nSen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he was “trying to understand” why the administration would oppose a resolution condemning Russia for the war.\n\n“I’m trying to understand the negotiating strategy. I can imagine this was a strategic vote in order to negotiate a hasty and expeditious outcome to a horrible war,” he said. “I will withhold judgment or further comment until I learn more about that.”\n\nBut he said there’s no question that Russia is the aggressor in the war.\n\n“I agree that Russia is the aggressor. I’m acknowledging it, and so many members of Congress are acknowledging that,” he said.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), speaking on the Senate floor, said Trump’s refusal to call out Putin as the aggressor has undermined U.S. leverage heading into the peace talks.\n\n“The United States should have been willing to say this was an illegal war unjustly initiated by Russia. If you’re unwilling to state a truth, you begin in a very weak position,” he warned.\n\nOther Republican senators pushed back on the reluctance of some high-ranking Trump administration officials to blame Russia for sparking the conflict three years ago.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth in a “Fox News Sunday” interview told host Shannon Bream “it’s a very complicated question” when asked if it would be fair to say Russia attacked Ukraine without provocation.\n\nOn Tuesday, Stephen Feinberg, the co-founder of Cerberus Capital Management whom Trump has nominated to serve as the Pentagon’s No. 2-ranking official, declined to assign blame to Russia during his Senate confirmation hearing.\n\n“I don’t feel that I should publicly comment in the middle of tense negotiations when I’m not privy to the facts,” he said when asked by Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) to confirm that Russia indeed invaded its neighbor.\n\nTrump last week suggested Ukraine was primarily responsible for the war but later walked back his comment.\n\nThe president said last week that Ukraine “should have never started the war” but later modified his statement by acknowledging “Russia attacked.”\n\nTrump stirred some concern among defense hawk Republicans by refusing to call Putin a dictator when asked Monday about his comments last week calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a “dictator without elections.”\n\n“I don’t use those words lightly,” he said when asked whether he views Putin as a dictator.\n\nSeveral Republican senators Tuesday, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.), avowed that Russia is solely to blame for the conflict.\n\n“We’re not confused about the facts. That is a fact,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said.\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) said “Russia’s clearly the aggressor.”\n\nHe pointed to quote from the 1946 Nuremberg Trials International Military Tribunal he had posted on social media in response to the U.S. voting against the U.N. resolution condemning Russia.\n\n“To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole,” it read.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a close Trump ally and prominent voice on national security issues, said “Russia is the aggressor.”\n\nSenate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) last week rejected Trump’s lenient view of Putin, telling CNN in an interview that the Russian president is a “war criminal who should be in jail for life.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Wicker told CNN that “it’s clear to most Americans that this war was started by Vladimir Putin’s aggression” dating back as far as 2014, when Russia invaded and seized Crimea.\n\n“It seems to me that multiple administrations have not been as firm as we should have been,” he said.",

        "full_text": "Socialism is popular!\n\nA Pew study reports that more than a third of American adults view it positively.\n\nHow is this possible?\n\nLittle has brought more misery -- first in the Soviet Union, then in China, Cuba, Nicaragua, now Venezuela ...\n\nOne reason young people support socialism is because their social media feeds show videos made by popular but economically illiterate people.\n\nTikTok star Madeline Pendleton has 1.6 million subscribers. My new video shows her telling them: \"Socialism is working better than capitalism 93% of the time!\"\n\nWhere does she get 93%?\n\nFrom a study published in 1986 by self-described Marxists in the Journal of Health Services.\n\nThe authors conveniently ignore the United States and other wealthy countries and compare socialist economies to \"capitalist\" countries like Uganda, Rwanda, and Somalia, some of which were at war.\n\nIt's so stupid. But based on that, Pendleton tells her followers, \"We have all the data showing that socialism does work.\"\n\nShe also celebrates communism because of its \"increased life expectancy.\"\n\nThat's nonsense, too. People live longest in capitalist countries like Japan (85 years) and South Korea (84 years). Even in the United States (79 years), where more of us die young because we drive more (car accidents), eat more, shoot each other more often, and try more dangerous drugs, we still live longer than people in China (78 years).\n\nSocialism is also superior, says Pendleton, because of \"the 90-100% home-ownership rates.\"\n\n\"One hundred percent,\" of course, is just dumb, but China (if you believe the party's statistics) does have 90% homeownership.\n\nBut not under socialism! They achieved that only after privatizing urban housing. Before 1998, when Chinese housing was still socialist, just 20% of Chinese people owned homes.\n\nSeveral social media stars rave about China. \"Socialism worked in China!\" says TikToker Dante Munoz. \"They lifted over 800 million people from poverty.\"\n\nAgain, it's true that in the last 50 years, China's GDP went from $156 per capita to more than $12,000. But that only happened after China gave up on real socialism and started embracing markets. Hong Kong, which adopted actual capitalism, raised per capita GDP to $50,000.\n\nBefore China reformed, millions of people died of starvation.\n\nAnother silly social media star, JT Chapman, tells his almost 2 million YouTube subscribers: \"The central idea that unites all socialists is maximizing freedom ... democratization of power.\"\n\nDemocratization? In most socialist countries, there's only one political party.\n\nA popular TikToker calling himself Rathbone tells his hundred thousand subscribers: \"capitalism ... prioritizes profits over people ... (but) socialism ... prioritizes people over profits.\"\n\nLikewise, Chapman says socialism offers the \"guaranteed right to ... health care, food and shelter.\"\n\nWell, socialism promises those things and claims to prioritize people over profits, but what people actually get is different.\n\nAs Cuban doctors put it in this video, \"The Cuban health care system is destroyed ... People are dying in the hallways.\"\n\nYet Chapman claims, \"Innovation can flourish even when people are not motivated by profit. The USSR gave the world the anthrax vaccine, artificial satellites and one of the earliest mobile phones.\"\n\nThat is true. But no one uses those phones today. Capitalism just creates much more.\n\nFinally, Chapman says, \"Ownership should be collective.\"\n\nCollective ownership does feel good. \"We'll share everything!\"\n\nBut every attempt at collective ownership has failed.\n\nOne famous American example: 200 years ago, New Harmony, Indiana, abolished private property, promising a \"community of equality.\"\n\nThe result was famine.\n\nWhen people realized they could receive just as much barely working as they could working hard, many, naturally, worked less. Within a year, the commune experiment failed, and the property was returned to private hands.\n\nWhat do these popular social media stars say when I confront them with these inconvenient truths? Sadly, I don't know. Not one would appear on Stossel TV to debate.\n\nThe bottom line: Incentives matter. No one washes a rental car. Few people care much about what belongs to everyone. It's just human nature.\n\nCapitalism isn't perfect, but if we want a better future and freedom, capitalism is the only thing that works.\n\nEvery Tuesday at JohnStossel.com, Stossel posts a new video about the battle between government and freedom.",

Share Copy Link ✓ Link copied to clipboard! Texas Representative Dan Crenshaw and conservative commentator Tucker Carlson are again at odds after Crenshaw was caught on a hot mic making a controversial remark about Carlson on Monday. The incident has ignited anger among some viewers and sparked interest in the long-standing tensions between the two figures, who have clashed repeatedly over political issues and personal criticisms. What Did Dan Crenshaw Say About Tucker Carlson? During a recent event in Texas, Crenshaw was allegedly overheard saying, \"I'd kill that guy if I had the chance,\" referring to Carlson. The comment came after Crenshaw was interviewed by GB News reporter Steven Edginton. During the chat scheduled for broadcast, Crenshaw had criticized Carlson's stance on Ukraine . Rep.

Graeme Sloan/Sipa USA The duo moved away from the set, but their microphones remained on. Edginton asked Crenshaw: \"Have you ever met Tucker?\" He replied: \"We've talked a lot. On Twitter . If I ever meet him, I'll f****** kill him.\" Crenshaw then added: \"I'm not joking. He's the worst person.\" The comment quickly went viral and sparked widespread criticism, particularly from viewers who support Donald Trump and MAGA. Crenshaw appeared to clarify his remarks later on X, formerly Twitter. Georgia Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene tagged Crenshaw and asked if he threatened to kill Carlson. The congressman denied it, writing, \"lol, no.\" Carlson responded to the incident on X by inviting the congressman for an interview. \"Why don't you come sit for an interview and we'll see how you do? I'll send you my address,\" Carlson wrote. Who Is Dan Crenshaw? Dan Crenshaw is a U.S. representative representing Texas' 2nd congressional district. A former Navy SEAL who lost his right eye during an explosion in Afghanistan, he medically retired in September 2016 as a lieutenant commander after serving 10 years in the SEAL teams. He serves on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Committee. He married his wife Tara in 2013, and they have one daughter. Crenshaw's military service earned him respect among veterans and conservatives. His memoir, Fortitude: American Resilience in the Era of Outrage , emphasizes the importance of mental resilience. Is Dan Crenshaw A Democrat Or A Republican? Dan Crenshaw is a member of the Republican Party . First elected to Congress in 2018, he has aligned himself with traditional conservative values, advocating for a strong national defense, limited government and free-market principles.

Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images Dan Crenshaw And Tucker Carlson's Relationship Explained The feud between Crenshaw and Carlson dates back several years and is rooted in their differing approaches to conservative politics. Carlson, a former Fox News host, has criticized Crenshaw over the representative's support for U.S. military aid to Ukraine in its war against Russia. The duo has targeted one another on social media. Per Politico, Carlson once mocked Crenshaw as one of \"the dumbest\" Republicans . Crenshaw had called Carlson a \"cowardly, know-nothing elitist.\" One notable clash occurred in 2022, when Carlson questioned Crenshaw's support for U.S. military aid to Ukraine, referring to him as \"Eyepatch McCain\"—a reference to the late Senator John McCain , known for his hawkish foreign policy. Crenshaw condemned the comment as disrespectful to wounded veterans and accused Carlson of prioritizing entertainment over serious political discourse. Carlson also targeted Crenshaw last year concerning the bill placing restrictions on the social media platform TikTok , owned by Chinese company ByteDance. On March 15, 2024, Carlson shared a clip on X of Crenshaw outside the U.S. Capitol, speaking about privacy and data protection. Carlson wrote: \"Crenshaw tells reporter Liam Cosgrove that U.S. intel agencies don't meddle in domestic news coverage, when of course he knows that's untrue. Watch his face as he says it. Liar.\" Despite their public disagreements, both figures continue to wield significant influence within conservative circles. fairness meter fairness meter Newsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.

        "full_text": "In 2023, US imports under AGOA topped $9.7 billion, down from $10.2 billion the previous year. The arrangement, which allows eligible African countries and businesses to export goods to the US under favorable tariff-free terms, was dominated that year by $4.2 billion in crude oil trade. It also included around $1.1 billion in apparel and over $900 million in agricultural products.\n\nThe US Congress is responsible for approving the next iteration of the act, which has typically commanded bipartisan support. But there is uncertainty about its future this time around, not least because of the tone of the debates around free trade in Washington. Trump’s “America First Trade Policy” executive order on Jan. 20 has called on the US Trade Representative, the Treasury department, and the Commerce department to review all United States trade deals. Some analysts are awaiting the outcome of that review on April 1 to determine AGOA’s future.\n\nAD\n\n“The idea of a preferential trade deal is a difficult one in the current environment. And given the executive order, it leaves a question mark on AGOA’s future,” said Frannie Léautier, who authored an Atlantic Council report in 2023 calling for AGOA’s early renewal. It could boil down to making a practical case in AGOA’s favor, showing that tariffs are more costly than preferential trade for US companies. “That might help,” said Léautier.\n\nThe uncertainty around AGOA is surprising because while there are differences of opinion around technical details, the trade act has always received bipartisan support in Congress and from White House administrations of either stripe.\n\nEven Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, which is broadly believed to be a rough blueprint for Trump’s policy approach, offered fairly standard language about AGOA ahead of last November’s election.\n\nAD\n\nBut AGOA seems to have been caught up in the shock and awe furor around the dismantling of USAID and no one is certain anymore what might happen. “I don’t know” was the most common response I got in recent days when I spoke to Africa analysts and Congress aides. A few months earlier it was “when” not “if.”\n\nTo be clear, while AGOA has had some wins, it has not been the kind of rip-roaring success that has driven African imports to grow exponentially every year. The $9.7 billion AGOA imports to the US last year was a miserly share of the $3.9 trillion of global US imports.\n\nAnd yet, even in this Trump 2.0-era of Washington upheaval, there is an optimistic take that’s beginning to crystallize. This is that forcing AGOA to be seen as a transactional opportunity for the US as much as for Africa will help break the program away from its development partnership roots. If successful, the optimistic view is it could finally start to be transformative for more African countries.\n\nSouth Africa has been in the eye of the storm with regards to US relations in recent weeks in a range of sensitive geopolitical and domestic policy issues. AGOA came into focus as one of the levers that might be used against South Africa when four US congressmen called for its eligibility to be revoked.\n\nThis is particularly significant because South Africa, the continent’s most industrialized economy, is the largest beneficiary of the free trade program through which it exports cars, citrus fruits, wine, and textiles worth nearly $2 billion annually to the US.\n\nNeil Diamond, president of the South African Chamber of Commerce in the US, told Semafor: “The biggest immediate concern is uncertainty, which discourages investment, disrupts supply chains, and forces businesses to consider alternative markets.”",

        "full_text": "House Republicans hunting for ways to pay for President Trump’s tax cuts have called for cutting the federal government’s share of Medicaid spending, including a proposal that would effectively gut the Affordable Care Act’s 2014 expansion of the program.\n\nCutting Medicaid spending, which is expected to be central to fulfilling the budget plan that House Republicans adopted Tuesday night, could result in millions of Americans across the country losing health coverage unless states decide to play a bigger role in its funding.\n\nFederal and state governments share the costs of Medicaid, which is a public health insurance program largely for low-income people.\n\nRepublicans are considering lowering the 90 percent share that the federal government is required to pay to states that enroll participants in the expansion. The change could generate $560 billion in savings over a decade, money that Republicans want to use toward extending Mr. Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, which are set to expire at the end of 2025. Extending the tax cuts is expected to cost $4.5 trillion, meaning Republicans will have to find savings beyond Medicaid from a long menu of options.\n\nA move to lower federal spending on the Medicaid expansion population could effectively gut the program. Around 10 states that have expanded their programs have so-called trigger laws that reverse the Medicaid expansion if the federal government decreases funding for the population.\n\nThe change could leave the 40 states that participate in the Obamacare program with a difficult set of choices. They could shoulder the extra costs to preserve Medicaid coverage for millions, make cuts to coverage or look for cuts from other large government programs to offset the reduction in federal funds.\n\nMedicaid, which covers more than 70 million people, is the largest health insurance program in the nation, and the largest single source of funding for states. More than 21 million adults who were not eligible for Medicaid under pre-expansion guidelines received coverage last year. The program had previously restricted enrollment primarily to those who were pregnant, disabled or elderly.\n\nAmong those who qualified for Medicaid under the expansion was Jeannie Brown, a 60-year-old part-time bus driver for the public school system in Belgrade, Mont. Ms. Brown went more than five years without health insurance beginning in 2009, avoiding medical care as her health deteriorated and she cared for her disabled granddaughter.\n\nMs. Brown, who makes around $25,000 each year, had been trapped in the so-called coverage gap, with a salary too high for Medicaid, and too low for a heavily subsidized Obamacare plan.\n\nAfter Montana lawmakers voted in 2015 to take up the Affordable Care Act’s option to expand Medicaid to cover more adults, Ms. Brown enrolled. She began to see a primary care doctor, and Medicaid paid for hand surgeries, knee replacements, a double mastectomy and her inhaler, she said.\n\n“Being a caregiver is extremely exhausting, especially with someone who has a lot of health needs,” she said last week from a children’s hospital in Colorado, where her granddaughter had been flown for emergency care. “If I didn’t have the preventative care I needed, I’d be in a much worse place physically. I’d probably be disabled.”\n\nConservative critics of Medicaid expansion have argued that it forces the federal government to spend exorbitantly, and disproportionately, to cover health services for a population Medicaid was not intended to serve.\n\n“The higher federal match for able-bodied adults creates perverse incentives to divert funds from more vulnerable populations,” said Michael Cannon, the director of health policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.\n\nRepublicans have also pointed to what they say is unanticipated runaway Medicaid spending. Some states have seen unexpected surges in Medicaid costs in recent years, in part because many Americans delayed care during the coronavirus pandemic. Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, recently proposed a $2.5 billion increase in state spending on the program.\n\nThe move to pare back the federal government’s financial commitments to Medicaid could profoundly reshape how it shares responsibility with states to offer health care to some of the poorest Americans, as well as the providers and nursing homes that care for them.\n\nThe change would amount to a “massive transfer of the financial responsibility from the federal government to states,” said Daniel Tsai, who oversaw Medicaid under former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\n“You’d have states having enormous budget holes making decisions between how to do the right thing to keep people covered” and how to preserve other programs, he said. “States are going to be cash strapped.”\n\nMedicaid expansion has become a deeply bipartisan project over the past decade, underscoring the Affordable Care Act’s reach in the American health system and its appeal even to Republican governors and state lawmakers who once opposed it. Much of the additional enrollment comes from Republican-led states where voters passed ballot initiatives to enact the program.\n\nMedicaid now funds almost half of all births in the United States, and represents more than half of spending on long-term care. More than 70 percent of Americans say they want Medicaid to stay as it is, according to a survey conducted last year by KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group.\n\nSenator Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told HuffPost last week that he had filed an amendment to a Senate budget resolution prohibiting cuts from Medicaid. After his state expanded the program in 2021, more than 300,000 low-income residents joined the rolls.\n\nRepresentative Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican, said on Sunday that lawmakers may focus on imposing a national work requirement on Medicaid, a controversial proposal that would amount to only a fraction of the cuts congressional Republicans are seeking. Ohio recently asked the Trump administration for permission to test out the policy.\n\nJon Tester, the former Democratic senator from Montana, said that Medicaid cuts could have a more sweeping effect on rural America than urban areas because of how the program sustains impoverished areas with few health providers. “And that’s an interesting conundrum because most of rural America is a much deeper red than urban America,” he said.\n\n“If you take away health care, you can’t live there,” Mr. Tester said.\n\nRepublicans are also considering limiting how much the federal government spends on a state’s Medicaid program, a practice known as block granting or per capita caps. That strategy could save as much as $900 billion over a decade.\n\nIf states picked up the costs from the federal government and kept their expansion populations in place, they would spend more than $600 billion to do so over a decade, an increase of almost 20 percent, according to KFF. Many states would be short more than $10 billion over a decade, and some larger states, such as New York and California, would face a shortfall of more than $50 billion.\n\nWith Montana’s expansion program set to expire in June, a group of state lawmakers there advanced legislation last week that would extend the program, in part to keep health providers in the heavily rural state solvent. Roughly 80,000 people in the state now have coverage through the state’s expansion, drastically lowering the state’s uninsured rate.\n\nBut like in other states, Montana’s Medicaid expansion has been preserved in part because of strong Republican support in the state Legislature. One Republican state senator in favor of Medicaid expansion, Russ Tempel, said that it had increased behavioral health services in the state and was keeping the few hospitals in his rural district afloat.\n\nMatt Regier, the Republican president of the Montana Senate, said that hospitals in the state had become too reliant on Medicaid, and that its expansion was “incentivizing people to not stand on their own two feet.”\n\n“That’s the opposite of what a government safety net should be,” he said.\n\nIn Illinois, another state with a trigger law, roughly a quarter of the state’s Medicaid program is part of the expansion population, and the state’s uninsured rate dropped by 44 percent after the expansion took effect, said Alex Gough, a spokesman for Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat. The state receives more than $7 billion for that group, Mr. Gough added.\n\n“Threats to coverage would spell catastrophe,” he said. He added that eliminating the Medicaid expansion “would cause major disruption to the state’s health care infrastructure that relies on Medicaid funding and, ultimately, its economy.”\n\nDemocratic legislators in Virginia are trying to protect Medicaid by getting rid of the trigger provision. State officials are also girding for a new wave of enrollment from laid-off federal workers.\n\n“I’m not confident Virginia would be able to provide full coverage” with drastically lower federal funding, said Ghazala Hashmi, a Democratic state senator who has proposed a new committee to study the issue. “That is not a burden a state budget could bear.”",

Share Copy Link ✓ Link copied to clipboard! Something is fundamentally broken in America. And you can get a hint of it in the way Americans think about and interact with news about the world. Especially news about politics. A fascinating new study from public opinion firm Change Research puts its finger on the problem: \"navigating a sea of bias, sensationalism, and misinformation exhausts and annoys significant portions of voters.\" The researchers show that it's this basic aggravation with the way we get information that is at the core of a lot of voter behavior. Americans have grown weary; not just of the news, but also of the entire miserable chore of learning about it. Which explains the stunning statistic that the share of Americans saying they closely follow news dropped 13 points in the past eight years, and that today, only one-third of us pay any real attention to the world around us. Like singles on a dating app wading through a sea of creeps, duds, and weirdos until they quiet-quit the dating pool out of sheer exasperation, people are opting out of news out of frustrated fatigue. Pedestrians walk past a newspaper vending machine as it lies next to the PNI Building, which housed the Philadelphia Inquirer in 2006 in Philadelphia. Pedestrians walk past a newspaper vending machine as it lies next to the PNI Building, which housed the Philadelphia Inquirer in 2006 in Philadelphia. William Thomas Cain/Getty Images Except that when Americans swipe left on current events, the consequences are a lot more disastrous . President Donald Trump actually won the last election only because so few voters were paying attention: voters who said they barely follow news favored him by 19 points in 2024; those who follow news \"a great deal\" favored Vice President Kamala Harris by 6. Those Americans seeing the past month of chaos , rising prices, surrender to our enemies, and the trail of death and disease that Trump has created might be screaming, like Adam Sandler in The Wedding Singer , that they wish all of this had been brought to their attention yesterday... as in, before the election. Except it was. Anyone taking even a little bit of interest knew this was coming. As voters in a republic who are supposed exercise self-determination, that's on us. Mostly. But it's also on the media. Because they're the ones who are supposed to help the citizenry make informed decisions so that we can govern ourselves. And they're the ones that have made reading news feel like jumping into the trash compactor in Star Wars : wading through muck, waiting for some cyclopean alien eel to jump out and drown you. What a wonderful smell we've discovered. Read more The Presidential Power Grab That Should Terrify Every American | Opinion With McConnell Retiring, the Old GOP Is Gone for Good | Opinion Trump's Hate for the FCPA Isn't About \"Government Efficiency\" | Opinion Is there any way out of the cesspool? It depends on whether media organizations figure out the secret. What they need to see is that the thing that is ultimately broken in America is trust. Stacks of research show that trust in institutions has been cratering and news media are among the biggest losers in the great American confidence die-off. But there are a few clever media entities that are thriving right now, and it's highly likely that a major reason is that they've recognized ways to address some of the root causes —perceptions of bias, sensationalism, misinformation, and financial motivations—behind people's loss of faith. For example, the Philadelphia Inquirer is tackling reader skepticism of media motivations by leaning into their not-for-profit ownership as a contrast to their competitors. They've successfully branded themselves as a paper that's more willing to shoot straight with readers because they're less driven by the balance sheet. That differentiation directly attacks one of the biggest sources of loss of reader trust—the feeling that what they're reading is dripping with sensationalism. Articles look less like click-bait if the newspaper doesn't seem like it has quite the same need to chase clicks. Substack is following a different trust-based model, and it's clearly resonating . It allows subscribers to develop a direct, social media-like connection with creators, so they can feel like they are getting more unvarnished analysis with less suspicion of platform owner bias. Creators also often mix the DIY Substack vibe with the name-brand professionalism of big-name-media by straddling both worlds. The smarter media outlets have seen this as a good thing, a win-win way to build greater reader trust for themselves by tapping into the creators' direct audience connection. Both of us are becoming such straddlers, and one of us (Schecter), a former Daily Beast columnist, is literally starting his own Substack right now (feel free to come give feedback on this article in his 12-hour livestream happening today, or hit Robison's ). To be sure, this list is neither complete nor perfect, and these steps are necessary but may not be sufficient. But the take-home is clear: if news media is going to reverse the tune-out trend—which is something this country desperately needs—the table stakes are being much clearer about getting biases out in the open and helping people feel like they at least know what they're getting. And they can't just hope that it will happen; Walter Cronkite ain't walking through that door, so they've got to work for it... If they do, the marketplace may even reward them.

        "full_text": "The U.S. Supreme Court temporarily delayed a court-mandated deadline requiring the Trump administration to pay nearly $2 billion to contracted aid organizations for work they already completed.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, in an order Wednesday night, stayed a lower court order that the administration pay out $1.9 billion by midnight. In his order, Roberts asked the aid groups that sued the Trump administration to provide a response by noon Friday after which the court will decide its next steps.\n\nRoberts' order came after the Trump administration sought emergency intervention by the high court after a panel of federal appeals court judges denied the administration's earlier request to push the deadline.\n\nActing Solicitor General Sarah Harris asked the justices to impose an administrative stay -- freezing the status quo for a short time.\n\n\"What the government cannot do is pay arbitrarily determined demands on an arbitrary timeline of the district court’s choosing or according to extra-contractual rules that the court has devised,\" Harris wrote in the emergency request, saying the deadline created \"an untenable payment plan\" at odds with the president's obligations.\n\n\"The order appears to contemplate the immediate outlay of nearly $2 billion. And the government has no sure mechanism to recover wrongfully disbursed funds delivered to entities that claim to be near insolvency,\" Harris said in the request.\n\nIn proceedings earlier Wednesday denying a request to stay his deadline, U.S. District Court Judge Amir Ali, a Biden-era appointee, balked at the government's insistence that it couldn't meet the midnight payout deadline and criticized the Trump administration for waiting until Tuesday to raise the argument that they lack the ability to restart the funding.\n\n\"This is not something that Defendants have previously raised in this Court, whether at the hearing or any time before filing their notice of appeal and seeking a stay pending appeal. That is so even though Plaintiffs' motion to enforce explicitly proposed compliance on this time frame,\" Ali wrote.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ali had ordered the Trump administration to dole out delayed payments that could total nearly $2 billion, according to a USAID official, to multiple nonprofit groups, determining the Trump administration violated the terms of a temporary restraining order issued two weeks ago regarding freezing foreign aid.\n\nA top official with the United States Agency for International Development claimed that complying with Tuesday's court order would require paying foreign aid groups nearly $2 billion, arguing the payments \"cannot be accomplished\" in the timeframe set by the court.\n\nLawyers with the Department of Justice asked Ali in a late-night filing on Tuesday to issue a stay of his order that requires the Trump administration to pay by Wednesday at 11:59 p.m. any outstanding debts to foreign aid groups for work completed prior to Feb. 13. The Trump administration initially tried to freeze the payments via an executive order before Judge Ali ordered the payments to resume two weeks ago.\n\nDOJ lawyers argued that fulfilling the payments is not only technically impossible but would also prevent the Trump administration from ensuring the payments are \"legitimate.\"\n\n\"The order apparently requires the Government to expend taxpayer dollars without regard to any processes for ensuring that the expenses are legitimate—even though Executive Branch leadership harbors concerns about the possibility of waste and fraud and is in the process of developing revised payment processing systems to address those concerns,\" DOJ attorney Indraneel Sur wrote in a late-night filing.\n\nAccording to Peter Marocco, the deputy administrator of USAID and director of foreign assistance at the State Department, complying with the court order would require dispersing $1.5 billion between 2,000 payment requests at USAID and an additional $400 million in payments at the State Department.\n\nEarlier this week, Judge Ali excoriated Trump administration attorneys during a lengthy hearing over its failure to pay the groups for work they conducted prior to President Trump's Jan. 20 executive order, which froze all foreign aid for 90 days. Ali also signed an order to enforce a temporary restraining order he signed on Feb. 13, ruling the groups must be paid by 11:59 p.m. Wednesday.\n\n\"Plaintiffs submitted evidence that defendants have not lifted the suspension or freeze of funds as the [temporary restraining order] required. Defendants have not rebutted that evidence, and when asked today, defendants were not able to provide any specific examples of unfreezing funds pursuant to the Court's TRO,\" Judge Ali said after a two-hour hearing today.\n\nLawyers with the Department of Justice acknowledged that the Trump administration ignored the temporary restraining order, which prohibited them from freezing foreign aid funds since the order was issued. Instead, they argued that they should not be required to pay back the money because of \"sovereign immunity.\"\n\nDuring an extended exchange with Ali, a DOJ lawyer struggled to answer basic questions about the Trump administration's compliance with the temporary restraining order, which prevented the administration from freezing funds.\n\n\"I'm not sure why I can't get a straight answer from you on this. Are you aware of an unfreezing of the disbursement of funds for those contracts and agreements that were frozen before February 13?\" Ali asked. \"Are you aware of steps taken to actually release those funds?\"\n\n\"I'm not in a position to answer that,\" DOJ attorney Indraneel Sur said.\n\n\"We're 12 days in and you're here representing the government...and you can't answer me whether any funds that you've kind of acknowledged or covered by the court's order have been unfrozen?\" Judge Ali responded.\n\n\"All I can do, really, is say that the preparations are underway for the joint status report on compliance,\" Sur said.\n\nAt one portion of the lengthy court hearing, Sur attempted to offer a legal justification for the Trump administration's noncompliance, prompting a stern response from the judge about his order, the terms of which he said were \"clear as day.\"\n\n\"The purpose of this hearing is to understand and to hear arguments on the motion to enforce TRO. It is not an opportunity to re-litigate the TRO,\" Ali said.\n\nA lawyer representing the nonprofits who brought the case argued that the lack of a response from the Trump administration amounts to defiance of the court order.\n\n\"What the court's colloquy with the government has revealed is that the government has done nothing to make the flow of payments happen,\" he said. \"As far as we are aware, there's been zero directives from the agency with respect to the unfreezing of funds.\"",

        "full_text": "In 2009, raucous town halls for Democratic members of Congress were a sign that Barack Obama’s “hope and change” agenda risked a public backlash. Now, it’s elected Republicans who star in viral-video town halls, as they parry complaints from an enraged crowd. Many of these complaints have focused on cuts to federal programmes as well as DOGE layoffs, and they have put some Republicans on the defensive. One Republican House member, for instance, told NBC News that he wanted to see more “compassion” from the administration going forward.\n\nTo some extent, town halls are political theatre, and progressive activists have recognised in them an opportunity to hold Republicans’ feet to the fire. But they are also part of a growing pool of evidence that the sweeping disruption of the first month of the Trump administration has started to generate some resistance. Elected in part out of dissatisfaction with the economy of the Joe Biden years, the new regime cannot afford to take its eye off kitchen-table issues.\n\nBeyond these town halls, some polling has raised red flags. While Trump remains more popular than during his first term (as well as considerably more popular than Biden in the closing year of his presidency), his numbers have dipped a bit over the first month of his presidency. Even more importantly, approval for his economic policies has also fallen in polling. A CNN poll published last week found that 51% of Americans thought the President had gone “too far” in cutting the federal government — and 62% believed that he was not doing enough to tackle inflation. Economic anxiety can be read in other measures, too. The consumer-confidence index dropped from January to February and remains well below where it was during most of Trump’s pre-pandemic presidency.\n\nIt’s obviously too early to judge the new administration’s economic programme, or to expect its agenda to have already had a major effect on inflation. But that polling does indicate where the public’s priorities lie. The Right-wing X echo chamber might delight in battles with the “deep state”, but the majority of swing voters turned to Trump in 2024 in part because of their warm memories of the economy during his first presidency. That gives him some goodwill now that he has resumed office, but it also means that voters expect him to deliver.\n\nTrump was partly able to take over the Republican Party almost a decade ago because of the unpopularity of the austerity agenda which had become ascendant during the Tea Party era. Voters consistently backed away from the GOP when its talk about “limited government” transformed into proposals to slash federal programmes, especially entitlements. Sweeping federal cuts today could actually revive the pains that austerity inflicted on Republican electoral prospects. If the cuts seem erratic and haphazard, public sentiment could turn quickly.\n\nDOGE’s allies insist that the growing US debt burden needs to be confronted. However, taking America’s fiscal challenges seriously only adds to the importance of not allowing administrative battles to get in the way of a bigger economic programme. Robust, broadly shared economic growth alleviates fiscal pressures and gives policymakers credibility when proposing bigger reforms. The last time that the United States tamed its deficit and took its debt burden on a long-term downward trajectory was in the late Nineties, when the go-go economy filled federal coffers and family bank accounts. For decades, recessions have caused a spike in deficit spending.",

        "full_text": "The ruling in Glossip v. Oklahoma overturns the conviction of a defendant who has spent more than two decades on death row and sends the case back for a new trial.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the majority and joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, highlighted the prosecution’s failure to correct false testimony from the state’s key witness, Justin Sneed.\n\n“Because the prosecution violated its constitutional obligations under Napue v. Illinois by knowingly allowing false testimony to go uncorrected, Mr. Glossip is entitled to a new trial,” Sotomayor wrote, referring to the error that took place in Glossip’s case at the state court level.\n\nThe majority opinion emphasized newly uncovered evidence that Sneed, who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and prescribed lithium, falsely testified that he had never seen a psychiatrist. Sotomayor noted that Oklahoma prosecutors not only knew this testimony was false but failed to correct it during Glossip’s trial — an omission that could have influenced the jury’s verdict given that Sneed’s testimony was the only direct link implicating Glossip in the 1997 murder of motel owner Barry Van Treese.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, who served on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overseeing Oklahoma cases, recused himself from the decision.\n\nIn dissent, Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito criticized the majority’s reliance on new evidence presented long after the trial, arguing that the false testimony was immaterial to the outcome. Thomas, joined by Alito and partially by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, contended that the defense failed to challenge Sneed’s testimony effectively during the trial and that the evidence against Glossip remained strong despite the inconsistencies.\n\nThomas said the majority “stretches the law at every turn to rule in his favor,” referring to Glossip. Barrett said she would not have ordered the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals to set aside Glossip’s conviction and that she would rather have corrected the state court’s “misstatement of Napue” and sent the case back for further proceedings.\n\nSUPREME COURT APPEARS DIVIDED OVER OKLAHOMA DEATH ROW APPEAL\n\nThe decision on Monday comes after years of legal challenges and a rare admission from Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, a Republican, who supported Glossip’s petition for a new trial after an independent investigation revealed withheld evidence and concerns about the integrity of the prosecution’s case.\n\nGlossip, who has spent over two decades on death row, now awaits a new trial in Oklahoma state court. The ruling marks a significant victory for death penalty reform advocates and raises fresh questions about prosecutorial conduct in capital cases.",

        "full_text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court refused Monday to hear a pair of cases from abortion opponents who say laws limiting anti-abortion demonstrations near clinics violate their First Amendment rights.\n\nThe majority did not explain their reasoning for turning down the appeals, as is typical, but two conservative justices, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, disagreed.\n\nThe cities said the laws were passed to address disturbing behavior from protesters outside of health care clinics. But anti-abortion activists said the measures violate free-speech rights and should be on their “deathbed” after the justices overturned Roe v. Wade and the nationwide right to abortion.\n\nOne case comes from Carbondale, Illinois, which is located near the state’s southern border and passed an ordinance after becoming a destination for patients from nearby states with abortion bans. The measure was quickly challenged in court, and has never been enforced. The city argued the appeal should be tossed because the ordinance was repealed shortly before abortion opponents went to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe other case is from New Jersey, where activist Jeryl Turco says she has approached women in Englewood for years to try to convince them not to have abortions. She says an 8-foot demonstration-free zone the city passed in 2014 in response to an aggressive group of protesters also wrongly kept her from approaching women.\n\nEnglewood argues that Turco has still been able to share her message outside of the immediate area near clinic entrances. Lower courts have ultimately upheld the ordinance, finding it isn’t a major First Amendment burden.\n\nBoth challengers pointed out that the high court struck down a Massachusetts law creating 35-foot demonstration free “buffer zones” around clinic doors in 2014. They say the Illinois and New Jersey laws should meet the same fate.\n\nBut cities say their rules are in line with a different Supreme Court decision from 2000, when the high court allowed a Colorado law to stand. It barred people from getting within 8 feet of others without permission in a 100-foot “bubble zone” around clinics.\n\nThomas said that case, known as Hill v. Colorado, was wrongly decided. In a dissent from the decision to decline the Illinois case, he said that the court wrongly treated it differently than other First Amendment cases because abortion was involved. “Hill has been seriously undermined, if not completely eroded, and our refusal to provide clarity is an abdication of our judicial duty,” he wrote.",

        "full_text": "Before the Trump administration closed USAID’s doors, the agency regularly routed funding to causes aligned with George Soros’ nonprofit empire, terrorists and drag queens.\n\nThe agency came under scrutiny from the new administration over failures to ensure transparency in its funding to organizations across the globe and concerns that the leadership was not responding to explicit policy directives from the State Department and the wider executive branch to align its programs with Trump policies and the U.S. national interest.\n\nIn recent days, the Trump administration identified USAID programs ranging from contraceptives for Afghanistan to LGBT diversity programs for European countries as clear evidence that foreign aid needed to be paused and reevaluated, a task that fell to the Rubio State Department.\n\nThe development agency for years also funneled money to several nonprofit groups that also received substantial backing from components of George Soros’ empire. Some previously came under scrutiny during the Obama administration for “democracy promotion” and judicial reform efforts in European countries that critics claimed promoted leftist politics.\n\nFor example, U.S. government spending records show that the East-West Management Institute, which is in part backed by Soros’ Open Society Foundations, received more than $260 million over the years in grants from USAID to, among other things, promote the rule of law in Georgia, strengthen civil society in Uganda, and advance Serbia’s accession talks with the European Union.\n\nThat same nonprofit group came under scrutiny during the Obama administration after Judicial Watch uncovered government records and communications showing that the East-West Management Institute’s “Justice for All” campaign in Albania received $9 million in funding from USAID.\n\nThe assistance concerned several GOP Senators, who sent a letter to the newly appointed Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in 2017, alleging the campaign funded by the U.S. government helped craft an Albanian judicial reform proposal that may “give the Prime Minister and left-of-center government full control over the judiciary.”\n\nThose same Senators also raised concerns about a similar Soros-backed program in neighboring Macedonia where they said a local affiliate called Foundation Open Society-Macedonia received backing from USAID through the Open Society Foundations and pushed “a progressive agenda.”\n\nOther Soros-backed organizations that received funding from both his Open Society Foundations network and USAID include the Anti-Corruption Action Center in Ukraine and Transparency International.\n\nAccording to the group's own records, the Anti-Corruption Action Center began receiving funding from USAID the same year the Maidan Revolution overthrew Ukraine’s elected, Russian-friendly President Viktor Yanukovych. The group, by its own admission, was heavily critical of Yanukovych’s government and ministers, which aligned with U.S. State Department policy at the time. During the 2014 Maidan Revolution, then-Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland visited Ukraine and was recorded on a leaked phone call discussing how the United States could influence the formation of a new government in Kyiv.\n\nGeorge Soros’ Open Society Foundations did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAfter temporarily shutting down USAID operation, the Trump administration defended the move, citing other left-wing causes that received funding grants from the agency. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt highlighted several when speaking with reporters on Monday, including $1.5 million for diversity measures in Serbia, $32,000 for a “transgender comic book” in Peru, and $70,000 for a DEI musical in Ireland.\n\nHouse Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Brian Mast, R-Fla., also flagged other examples of USAID funding, including $15 million for condoms sent to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and over $3 million for “being LGBTQ in the Caribbean.”\n\nThe government watchdog overseeing the agency also warned USAID’s leadership in a stinging January memo that it had created serious \"vulnerabilities\" by doling out billions of tax dollars to overseas countries and groups without fulling vetting for terrorists. That inspector general’s report also determined that USAID grants were being insufficiently monitored.\n\nIn one egregious example, a Syrian national was charged by the Justice Department last year for diverting more than $9 million worth of humanitarian aid paid for by USAID to a designated terrorist group affiliated with Al-Qaeda in Iraq.\n\nThe suspect, Mahmoud Al Hafyan, was the head of a Syrian nongovernmental organization that employed 160 individuals and was awarded $122 million by USAID between January 2015 and November 2018, according to the Justice Department. That money was designated to pay for food kits for Syrian refugees fleeing conflict zones.\n\nDuring this contract, the Justice Department alleges Al Hafyan worked with co-conspirators to funnel “millions” in food kits on the black market to the Al-Nusra Front, a local Al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria that is also designated a terrorist organization by the United States.\n\nThe USAID inspector general warned about the limits on the agency’s ability to monitor expenditures for programs in “nonpermissive” environments, like the conflict zones in Syria, meaning what happened there could happen in other places, like Ukraine or Gaza, where there are similar international or local organizations operating that are recipients of U.S. cash.",

        "full_text": "In early February, Texas health officials reported that measles was spreading among an insular religious community in Gaines County, Texas, where nearly 14 percent of schoolchildren have an exemption (granted in some states for reasons of conscience, including for religious beliefs) from the required childhood vaccinations. The disease has since been detected in a bordering New Mexico county. And this week, the case count grew to at least 124 people. Last year, the US saw 285 measles cases nationwide — the fourth-highest total since 2000.\n\nThe outbreak has escalated just as the US’s foremost vaccine skeptic, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has ascended as its top health care official. On February 26, the Texas health department reported the first death in the outbreak, an unvaccinated school-aged child.\n\nKennedy promises to probe the safety of childhood vaccines, and in his first actions as the new US Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary, Kennedy has already put vaccine advisory meetings on indefinite hold. He has helped cultivate a culture of skepticism toward medical science as the most prominent voice promoting a debunked link between childhood vaccinations and autism and other health issues — a view that corresponds to the re-emergence of measles over the past decade.\n\nKennedy is no longer an outside agitator but the government official ultimately responsible for squashing public health threats in the US.\n\nSo far, he has not commented on the Texas outbreak. But what happens next will be the first big test case for how Kennedy will lead the US health department during an active public health emergency.\n\nHow would the response to an outbreak normally look?\n\nWhen there is a disease outbreak that requires government action (i.e., not your standard sniffles), local governments are the first responders. County officials are typically the first to receive reports of a disease spreading and they will start ramping up testing and other kinds of surveillance to assess the situation.\n\nThat was what happened in Texas: One Gaines County school district reported the first measles to their local community in late January. Within a week, the Texas state government stepped up once the outbreak had climbed to six cases, and began providing support for the local response. That’s also typical: While local authorities are on the front line, the state provides technical expertise, they may offer funding for communication and interventions (such as vaccine drive-throughs), and they otherwise serve as the top authority on how the response should be handled.\n\nThe feds usually stay in the background with an outbreak the size of the current measles occurrence. They can offer expert or laboratory support, for example. But otherwise, they are supporting players, unless the outbreak poses a unique threat to the rest of the nation or becomes a large multi-state crisis. For now, the current outbreak is limited to a small geographical region, and the states appear well aligned on how to respond.\n\nBut it is possible that further spread could demand federal officials get more involved — a development that would be worth watching closely, given its new leadership.\n\nThe good news: So far, RFK Jr.’s HHS isn’t complicating the response.\n\nThe outbreak was already underway before Kennedy was confirmed and, though it’s easy to forget after the pandemic, local authorities are taking the lead as they should. Texas health officials — and their counterparts in New Mexico, now that cases have begun to spread there — have set up mobile vaccination and testing sites, encouraging unvaccinated people to get their shots now. Because local officials are among the community they serve, they may be considered more trustworthy (and in turn they can ultimately be more effective).\n\nIf those efforts are allowed to continue unencumbered, that will be a hopeful sign that the RFK Jr.-led health department will not actively sabotage public health efforts when there is an acute crisis underway. After some observers pointed out that the CDC measles tracker had not been with the new outbreak, the web page was refreshed on Friday with a pledge to continue updating it every Friday.\n\nSo far, there is no sign that local officials have requested support from the federal government and been denied it.\n\nShould I be worried about measles spreading more widely?\n\nNot exactly. Such outbreaks are still relatively rare and, when they do occur, they usually stay localized. But America is trending in the wrong direction when it comes to this ancient disease, which can cause painful skin rashes and be deadly for young unvaccinated children.\n\nThe US declared measles eliminated in 2000. But it has regained a foothold as vaccination rates have dropped. In 2019, there was the largest outbreak in decades when more than 1,200 people became ill, mostly in New York. Now more than 120 individuals are sick along the border of Texas and New Mexico — larger than any outbreak last year and it is still only February.\n\nNationally, the measles vaccination rate has slipped just below the 95 percent target that experts say is necessary to maintain population-level immunity. In some states, the situation is more dire: 14 states had vaccination rates below 90 percent for the 2023–2024 school year, per the health policy think tank KFF.\n\nBut in individual communities, rates can slip even lower, creating the right conditions for an outbreak to explode; measles, after all, is one of the most contagious diseases known to man. In the Gaines County school district most affected by the outbreak, the vaccination rate is under 50 percent.\n\nThe vast majority of Americans still believe the measles vaccine is safe and effective, and its benefits outweigh any risks. But as our collective faith in science deteriorates, vaccination rates are also declining.\n\nUpdate, February 26, 11:20 am ET: This story has been updated to include the first death of a child who contracted measles in the Texas outbreak.",

        "full_text": "Key events\n\nShow key events only\n\nPlease turn on JavaScript to use this feature\n\nClosing summary\n\nOur live coverage is ending now. In the meantime, you can find all of our live US politics coverage here. Here is a summary of the key developments from today:\n\nA Trump-forward budget proposal imperiling Medicaid narrowly passed in the Republican-led House. The budget plan includes an estimated $800bn in potential cuts from Medicaid, a federal program providing healthcare coverage to more than 72 million Americans. The resolution also includes a $4.5tn in tax cuts and increased funding for defense and border security, offset by $2tn in spending reductions over the next decade.\n\nNearly 6,000 veterans have been fired across the federal government since the start of Donald Trump’s term, according to a new analysis by House Democrats. The report, compiled from data provided by the office of personnel management, estimates that roughly 38,000 federal workers have been fired since Trump took office last month and empowered Elon Musk’s ‘efficiency’ agency to dramatically reduce the federal workforce.\n\nTrump has said that Volodymyr Zelenskyy is likely to visit the White House on Friday to sign a rare earth minerals deal to pay for US military aid to defend against Russia’s full-scale invasion. The announcement followed days of tense negotiations between the US and Ukraine in which Zelenskyy alleged the US was pressuring him to sign a deal worth more than $500bn that would force “ten generations” of Ukrainians to pay it back.\n\nTrump reinstated a rule requiring cost transparency in healthcare. The rule requires hospitals to publish online the prices for some of their most common services, including MRI scans and caesarean section deliveries. The lack of transparency has often left patients shocked by medical bills.\n\nTrump signed an executive order instructing the commerce secretary to launch an investigation into whether foreign copper production and imports threaten US economic and national security. According to White House officials, the investigation could lead to new tariffs on foreign copper, a material essential to manufacturing and construction, as well as critical to the US military and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence.\n\n‘More than one million’ federal workers have responded to Elon Musk/Doge’s ultimatum email, the White House has claimed. Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, also said agency heads will “determine the best practices” for dealing with the ‘what did you do last week’ email in terms of whether people should respond and who, if anyone, would get fired. NBC News reported that responses to the email will reportedly be fed into an artificial intelligence system to determine whether their jobs are necessary.\n\nIn a significant shift of journalistic power, the White House press team will now decide which journalists and media outlets will make up the White House press pool. Leavitt said legacy outlets will still be allowed to join and participate in the press pool, but the “privilege” will also be extended to “new voices” from “well-deserving outlets”. It builds on the decision to revoke the Associated Press’s full access to presidential events over its continued use of “Gulf of Mexico” as opposed to “Gulf of America”.\n\nSome 40% of the federal contracts the Trump administration claims to have canceled as part of its signature cost-cutting program aren’t expected to save the government any money, the administration’s own data shows. Doge last week published an initial list of 1,125 contracts that it terminated in recent weeks across the federal government. Data published on Doge’s “wall of receipts” shows that more than one-third of the contract cancellations, 417 in all, are expected to yield no savings.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 20 civil service employees resigned from Doge, saying they were refusing to use their technical expertise to “dismantle critical public services. “We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the constitution across presidential administrations,” the 21 staffers wrote in a joint resignation letter, a copy of which was obtained by the Associated Press. “However, it has become clear that we can no longer honor those commitments.”\n\nA federal judge in Seattle blocked the Trump administration’s effort to halt the nation’s refugee admissions system. US district judge Jamal Whitehead said in his ruling after the hearing on Tuesday that the president’s actions amounted to an “effective nullification of congressional will” in setting up the nation’s refugee admissions program. “The president has substantial discretion ... to suspend refugee admissions,” Whitehead told the parties. “But that authority is not limitless.”\n\nA US judge extended an order blocking the Trump administration from instituting a sweeping freeze on trillions of dollars in federal funding by pausing grants, loans and other financial support. US district judge Loren AliKhan in Washington wrote that while some funds had become unfrozen since she first temporarily blocked the administration’s spending pause, there remained a risk the administration might again try to shut off funding. The judge said for those reasons she agreed with groups representing nonprofits and small business that a preliminary injunction was necessary blocking a further funding freeze.\n\nA federal judge in Washington has ordered the Trump administration to pay foreign aid funds to contractors and grant recipients by 11.59pm on Wednesday night, saying there was no sign that it had taken any steps to comply with his earlier order that the funds be unfrozen.\n\nThe Senate confirmed Daniel Driscoll, an Iraq war veteran and adviser to JD Vance, as secretary of the army.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 03.51 CET\n\nThe tax cut proposals in this GOP budget blueprint passed on Tuesday center on $4.5tn in tax breaks, which would extend the tax cuts Trump implemented during his first term.\n\nThese tax cuts are currently set to expire later this year and the proposed package aims to prolong them. But the details of how these tax breaks would be structured haven’t been specified yet.\n\nTrump’s tax cuts helped billionaires massively during his first term, with the richest families in the US paying a lower tax rate than the working class for the first time in history in 2018.\n\nSeveral lawmakers are concerned that the proposed cuts – especially the $880bn over the next decade assigned to the committee overseeing healthcare spending, including Medicaid, and the $230bn allocated to the agriculture committee responsible for food stamps – could hinder their constituents back home.\n\n“The House Republican budget will make people sicker and poorer,” said Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committee. “It will force even more families to live paycheck to paycheck while giving the wealthiest Americans a windfall big enough to buy a new private jet.”\n\nNext steps involve weeks of committee hearings to draft the full legislative text, as well as negotiations with the Senate, where Republicans have their own scaled-back version.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 03.25 CET\n\nUndocumented immigrants in the US who fail to register with the federal government could face fines, imprisonment, or both, according to a directive issued Tuesday by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n“The Trump administration will enforce all our immigration laws – we will not pick and choose which laws we will enforce,” a DHS spokesperson said. “We must know who is in our country for the safety and security of our homeland and all Americans.”\n\nAccording to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services website, all immigrants over the age of 14 who were not fingerprinted or registered when applying for a US visa and who remain in the country for 30 days or longer must register and be fingerprinted.\n\nOnce registered and fingerprinted, DHS will provide evidence of registration, which immigrants over the age of 18 are required to carry at all times.\n\nLast month, upon returning to office, Donald Trump declared illegal immigration at the US-Mexico border a national emergency and directed DHS to ensure that immigrants register with the federal government.\n\nThe administration is also working to end the Biden-era CBP One entry program, which allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants to legally enter the US by scheduling appointments through an app.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 03.08 CET\n\nTrump-forward budget proposal imperiling Medicaid narrowly passes in Republican-led House\n\nThe House narrowly passed the budget resolution by a 217-215 vote after an intense push by Mike Johnson, the speaker, and Donald Trump.\n\nThe budget plan includes an estimated $800bn in potential cuts from Medicaid, a federal program providing healthcare coverage to more than 72 million Americans. The resolution also includes a $4.5tn in tax cuts and increased funding for defense and border security, offset by $2tn in spending reductions over the next decade.\n\nThe budget measure needed to pass by the 14 March deadline or risk a government shutdown.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 02.57 CET\n\nThe Social Security Administration said on Tuesday that it dissolved its office of civil rights and equal opportunity, and its employees will be put on administrative leave as of today.\n\nLee Dudek, Social Security’s acting commissioner, said in a statement that terminating the civil rights office “advances the President’s goal to make all of government more efficient in serving the American public”.\n\nThe agency’s office of civil rights and equal opportunity is responsible for planning and implementing programs designed to ensure equal opportunity in employment for all employees regardless of race, color, national origin, etc., according to its webpage.\n\nSSA says it will transfer responsibility for processing civil rights complaints and reasonable accommodation requests to other agency offices “to ensure compliance with existing legal authorities”.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 02.56 CET\n\nNearly 6,000 veterans have been fired across the federal government since the start of Trump’s term, according to a new analysis by House Democrats.\n\nLauren Gambino\n\nThe report, compiled from data provided by the office of personnel management, estimates that roughly 38,000 federal workers have been fired since Trump took office last month and empowered Elon Musk’s ‘efficiency’ agency to dramatically reduce the federal workforce.\n\n“Our veterans make significant sacrifices in service of our country, but those sacrifices do not seem to matter to President Trump and unchecked billionaire Elon Musk,” Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, ranking member of the House appropriations committee, said in a statement. “They are an essential part of our federal workforce, bringing their expertise to every single agency. Republicans are turning their back on them, allowing Musk to fire at least 6,000 veterans and leave them with no way to feed their families or keep a roof over their heads.”\n\nRepublicans have countered that the cuts are a necessary part of a long-overdue effort to root out government waste and inefficiency.\n\nThe federal government is the largest US employer of veterans, who comprise about 30% of the workforce.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 02.55 CET\n\nTrump says Zelenskyy set to visit White House on Friday to sign minerals deal\n\nAndrew Roth\n\nDonald Trump has said that Volodymyr Zelenskyy is likely to visit the White House on Friday to sign a rare earth minerals deal to pay for US military aid to defend against Russia’s full-scale invasion.\n\nThe announcement followed days of tense negotiations between the US and Ukraine in which Zelenskyy alleged the US was pressuring him to sign a deal worth more than $500bn that would force “ten generations” of Ukrainians to pay it back.\n\nMedia outlets reported late on Tuesday that the terms of an agreement had been reached.\n\n“I hear that he’s coming on Friday,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “Certainly it’s OK with me if he’d like to.”\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, which first reported the deal, the new terms of the deal did not reportedly include the onerous demands for a right to $500bn in potential revenue from exploiting the resources, which include rare earth metals and Ukrainian oil and gas resources.\n\nA framework for the deal included joint ownership of a fund to develop Ukraine’s mineral resources with certain caveats for those resources already contributing to the state budget.\n\nMore on the story here:\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 03.10 CET\n\nMichael Sainato\n\nThe Guardian’s labor reporter, Michael Sainato, spoke to USAid workers who are expected to be ‘escorted’ back to the office to collect their belongings amid Trump’s bid to shut down the foreign aid agency.\n\nStaff who spoke to the Guardian sounded the alarm over the impact of these moves on global security, warning that closing USAid and withdrawing foreign aid is “only leaving war on the table”.\n\nThe agency is “the canary in the coal mine” as Trump seeks to test the limits of his executive powers, said one USAid official, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation and harassment. “We see us as the most acute and boldest example of overreach, that checks and balances ought to restrain the powers of the president and the president should abide by the powers of Congress and the courts.\n\n“Can the president act like a king? We’re a glaring flare for all of those things.”\n\nThe agency has been subjected to attacks and conspiracy theories about its work, with Elon Musk and his supporters making false claims about funding, including a baseless claim about the agency sending $50m to Gaza for condoms, and false claims about grants such as the suggestion by the so-called “department of government efficiency” that $21m had been sent to India to influence elections.\n\nMusk has called the agency “a criminal organization” and argued that it was “time for it to die”. Pushed on his false condoms claim earlier this month, he responded: “Some of the things I say will be incorrect.”\n\nHealth clinics reliant on USAid grants in Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, Iraq and other countries around the world have been forced to shut down and international aid groups have already cut thousands of jobs due to the funding freeze.\n\nThe Trump administration is fighting challenges in court to freeze all USAid funding, place nearly all employees on leave.\n\n“USAid was established by act of Congress. It needs to be un-established by act of Congress. They are ignoring that rule,” the USAid official said. “I would guess around 500 workers, no one has provided specifics, senior leaders, HR and IT people, are left behind to participate in the dismantling of the agency.”\n\nContracts and grants are still being cut and terminated, with only a small fraction of the agency’s work abroad still continuing, they said. “We’re a lifesaving agency. They certainly have done damage that will take years to undo, but even though they’ve closed the building and banned us from it, we’re not done. We still exist,” they said.\n\nRead the full story here:\n\nShare\n\nAmericans are getting more concerned about a potential economic downturn caused by the policies of Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nUS consumer confidence plummeted in February, the biggest monthly decline in nearly four years, the Conference Board, a business research group, said on Tuesday. Inflation and a significant increase in mentions of trade and tariffs were the top concerns for respondents to the board’s survey.\n\nThe group’s consumer confidence index plummeted this month to 98.3 from 105.3 in January. That’s far below the expectations of economists, who projected a reading of 103, according to a survey by FactSet.\n\nThe proportion of consumers expecting a recession over the next year jumped to a nine-month high, the board said.\n\nConsumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of US economic activity and is closely watched by economists for signs about how the American consumer is feeling.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 01.52 CET\n\nMarina Dunbar\n\nTrump’s Iron Dome for America system is now reportedly called Golden Dome\n\nDonald Trump’s Iron Dome for America initiative for a missile defense system protecting US skies from attack has been reportedly renamed the Golden Dome for America.\n\nIn a video published on Thursday, secretary of defense Pete Hegseth referred to the project as “the Golden Dome or Iron Dome”. A defense official confirmed shortly after that the name of the initiative has been officially changed to “Golden Dome”, according to military news website Defense One.\n\nA spokesperson for Space Force did not respond to a Guardian query on the possible name change.\n\nThe idea of a new name comes as a team of technical experts has been assembled by the US Space Force to determine which programs can help build out the initiative.\n\nThe Iron – or perhaps now Golden – Dome for America executive order, signed by Trump on 27 January, is a directive for Hegseth to submit a comprehensive plan that details an implementation strategy, including the required architecture, for a missile defense system.\n\nTrump is known for his grand renaming of things, including the Gulf of Mexico, which is now known officially in the US as the Gulf of America, as well as having a gaudy taste for golden and luxurious decorations, such as that which often adorn his apartments and buildings like Trump Tower in New York.\n\nThe defense system focuses heavily on the concept of space-based sensors and interceptors. The company that currently dominates the market for such equipment is the Elon Musk-owned SpaceX, leading to concerns that this project is another way for Musk to make money from federal programs.\n\nRead the full story here:\n\nShare\n\nJohn Thune, the Senate majority leader, is defending the Trump administration’s cuts to federal workers and programs, calling them a long overdue “scrub” of the federal government.\n\nStill, the Republican from South Dakota acknowledged that the reductions are affecting the home states of GOP senators.\n\n“I think we all understand that this government, the federal government, is long in need of the kind of scrub that is being done to figure out how we can do things better,” Thune said at the Capitol.\n\nHe said that senators would make the Trump administration aware if programs, such as those that impact health and safety, are at risk.\n\nShare\n\nThe Trump administration plans to cut employees at the US Department of Housing and Urban Development who assist officials and citizens in navigating government housing programs, the AP reports.\n\nThese cuts are among the first steps in the administration’s broader plan to reduce HUD’s workforce by half.\n\nThe field policy and management division is expected to lose at least 145 employees – about 40% of its staff – by 18 May.\n\nA memo from the HUD secretary Scott Turner, dated Monday, states that all positions within the office at a certain pay grade and below “are being abolished”.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 00.04 CET\n\nTrump reinstates rule on healthcare cost transparency\n\nTrump reinstated a rule requiring cost transparency in healthcare.\n\nThe rule requires hospitals to publish online the prices for some of their most common services, including MRI scans and caesarean section deliveries. The lack of transparency has often left patients shocked by medical bills.\n\nTrump previously issued a similar order during the final year of his first term.\n\nHospitals and insurers had strongly opposed the rule, with many failing to comply.\n\n“It’s been unpopular in some circles because people make less money,” Trump said. “But it’s great for the patient. It’s great for the people in our country.”\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 01.57 CET\n\nFox News senior White House correspondent, Jacqui Heinrich, condemned the Trump administration’s decision to determine which outlets have access to the president as part of the press pool, a selection that the White House Correspondents’ Association makes.\n\n“This move does not give the power back to the people – it gives power to the White House,” Heinrich posted on X. “The WHCA is democratically elected by the full-time White House press corps.”\n\n“WHCA has determined pools for decades because only representatives FROM our outlets can determine resources all those outlets have – such as staffing – in order to get the President’s message out to the largest possible audience, no matter the day or hour,” she added.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 23.35 CET\n\nUSAid staffers have only 15 minutes to retrieve belongings from their former offices, according to The Associated Press.\n\nFor nearly three weeks, many staffers at the agency’s main building in Washington have been barred from entering as the administration continues dismantling the facility.\n\nSeveral employees have requested permission to retrieve personal items, including family photos and work shoes stored in drawers.\n\nThe notice about the arrangements says that aid workers must undergo security screening before reentering.\n\nThe Guardian’s labor reporter Michael Sainato reports that, in the notice, staffers were told to “bring their own boxes, bags, tape, and/or other containers to remove their personal items; these items will not be provided”.\n\n“Neither USAID, nor any of our assisting agencies, will provide boxes, tape, protective wrapping, or other packaging materials to assist with the retrieval process,” the notice reads.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 23.34 CET\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order suspending security clearances for lawyers at the Covington & Burling law firm that worked with special counsel Jack Smith.\n\nSmith led the federal cases against Trump on charges of trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat and mishandling of classified documents.\n\nThe order comes less than a month after the US justice department fired more than a dozen prosecutors who worked on the criminal cases against Trump in a move to purge people who worked for Smith.\n\nShare\n\nEdward Wong of the New York Times reports that Trump appointees at USAid have sent recently-fired employees a list of more than 100 weapons they are prohibited from bringing when returning to the office to collect their belongings.\n\nFirearms, axes, martial arts weapons, including nunchucks and throwing stars, were in the list, as well as spearguns and dynamite.\n\nStaff will collect their personal belongings at the Ronald Reagan Building this Thursday and Friday\n\nThere have been no known recent incidents of aid agency employees making weapon-related threats, Wong reports.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.49 CET",

        "full_text": "The fate of $20 billion in federal climate funding that was legally committed months before the election has been thrown into question after a weeklong controversy involving “gold bars,” the right-wing group Project Veritas and two federal agencies.\n\nNow, more than 200 planned investments intended to help finance clean energy and environmental projects in underserved communities may be at risk.\n\nLast week, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a press release announcing it had found billions of dollars, or what it called “gold bars,” that had been “parked” at a financial institution during the Biden administration.\n\nIn a video accompanying the release, Lee Zeldin, the leader of the E.P.A., criticized the Biden administration’s decision to use a private bank to disburse the funds and called for Citibank, the bank in question, to return the money.\n\nThe money was “green bank” funding from the E.P.A.’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which received $27 billion under the Biden-era 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nFunds were held in Citibank accounts under the names of eight nonprofit grantees, which were planning to send it to other green banks and loan it out for climate projects.\n\nDept. of Justice resignation\n\nThe situation escalated on Tuesday, when Denise Cheung, a top federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C., abruptly resigned after she refused to open a criminal investigation into an unnamed government vendor and freeze unspent assets. The vendor is believed to be Citibank, and the assets in question are thought to be the $20 billion identified by Zeldin’s team.\n\nCheung said in a resignation letter that she felt there was not sufficient evidence to restrict the nonprofits’ access to the accounts.\n\nBy Thursday, it wasn’t clear whether Citibank would freeze the funds. That has created confusion among grant recipients about whether they’ll have access to the money.\n\nThe Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the E.P.A. referred to a post on Zeldin’s X account. Citibank declined to comment.\n\nWhat about those ‘gold bars’?\n\n“My awesome team at E.P.A. has found the gold bars,” Zeldin said in the video last week. “This scheme was the first of its kind in E.P.A. history, and it was purposely designed to obligate all of the money in a rush job with reduced oversight.”\n\nThe “gold bars” were a reference to a hidden-camera video released by Project Veritas in December. The video appeared to show a person who was then an E.P.A. adviser comparing the outgoing administration’s efforts to spend federal climate money before it left office to throwing “gold bars” off the Titanic.\n\nThough Zeldin characterized the process as a “rush job,” plans to award $20 billion to the eight nonprofits were announced in April. The money was legally committed ahead of a September deadline.\n\nThe role of private banks\n\nThus far, there has been no evidence of illegal activity related to the $20 billion in funds. And the federal government has long made agreements with private banks, including Citibank, to handle financial transactions like the payment of government benefits with debit cards. A 2016 Government Accountability Office report found that one Treasury Department bureau was using 20 financial agents at the time.\n\nAdam Kent, director of blended and inclusive finance at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said a financial agent had been chosen for the E.P.A. grants to make it easier for green banks to raise additional money from private markets. (Green banks typically use a mix of public and private money to fund decarbonization efforts.)\n\nLast year the Biden administration estimated the funds would attract $7 in private capital for every government dollar spent.\n\nGrants and subgrants\n\nIn an interview with Fox News last week, Zeldin described the eight nonprofit grantees with Citibank accounts as “pass-throughs, giving money to subgrantees.”\n\nThis is by design, said Katherine Mogg, who was formerly in charge of legal and regulatory affairs at NY Green Bank. (As of 2021, there were 21 green banks across the country.)\n\nMogg said that long before the Inflation Reduction Act was passed, green energy proponents debated how federal funding could best be spread out to projects all around the country.\n\nThese top-level nonprofits would send funding to smaller entities, like state green banks, and the sub-grantees would then lend money to individual projects, Mogg said. As loan recipients repaid their debt, green banks could use the money to fund more new projects.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nAny attempt to freeze or claw back the green bank grants is likely to result in legal challenges.\n\nEven a relatively short delay could affect long-term plans for businesses counting on the program. In the coming months, more than $1 billion in investments is scheduled to close, including funds for affordable home construction projects and solar farms in Native American and rural communities.\n\nNew data from a NASA plane shows the widening threat of these slow-moving landslides, which have destabilized homes, businesses, and infrastructure like roads and utilities. Researchers have documented how the landslides have pushed westward, almost doubling in area since the state mapped them in 2007.\n\nThe landslides have also sped up in recent years. A month of aerial radar images taken by NASA in the fall revealed how land in the Palos Verdes Peninsula slid toward the ocean by as much as four inches each week between mid-September and mid-October. — Austyn Gaffney and Harry Stevens\n\nRead the full article.\n\nTrump plans deep cuts at office that funds recovery from big disasters\n\nThe Trump administration plans to all but eliminate the office that oversees America’s recovery from the largest disasters, raising questions about how the United States will rebuild from hurricanes, wildfires and other calamities made worse by climate change.\n\nThe Office of Community Planning and Development, part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, pays to rebuild homes and other recovery efforts after the country’s worst disasters, such as Hurricane Helene in North Carolina and Hurricane Milton in Florida. — Christopher Flavelle",

        "full_text": "A federal judge on Monday denied a request by the Associated Press to restore full access for the news agency's journalists after President Donald Trump's administration barred them for continuing to refer to the Gulf of Mexico in coverage.\n\nU.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee, declined to immediately grant the AP's request for a temporary injunction restoring its access to the Oval Office and Air Force One during a hearing in Washington federal court.\n\nThe AP sued three senior Trump aides on Friday, arguing that the decision to block its reporters from those locations violates the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protections against government abridgment of speech by trying to dictate the language they use in reporting the news.\n\nLawyers for the Trump administration argued in a court filing before the hearing that the AP does not have a constitutional right to what it called \"special media access to the president.\"\n\nWhite House Communications Director Steven Cheung in a earlier statement had called the AP lawsuit a \"blatant PR stunt.\" During an appearance last week at the Conservative Political Action Conference, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also said, \"We feel we are in the right in this position.\"\n\nLeavitt is one of the three White House officials named as defendants in the lawsuit. The other two, Chief of Staff Susan Wiles and Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich, have not responded to requests for comment.\n\nTrump signed an executive order last month directing the U.S. Interior Department to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.\n\nThe AP said in January it would continue to use the gulf's long-established name in stories while also acknowledging Trump's efforts to change it.\n\nThe White House banned AP reporters in response. The ban prevents the AP's journalists from seeing and hearing Trump and other top White House officials as they take newsworthy actions or respond in real time to news events.\n\nThe White House Correspondents' Association said in a legal brief backing the AP in the case that the ban \"will chill and distort news coverage of the president to the public's detriment.\" Reuters released a statement in support of the AP.",

I’ll lead Ohio to be the top state in the country where our kids get a world class education in math, reading, writing, critical thinking, and physical education.”\n\nRamaswamy continued to add that under his leadership Ohio would be the top state in the U.S. where “capitalism and meritocracy” is embraced, “instead of apologizing for it.”\n\n“We will lead Ohio to be the top state in the country that takes a hatchet to red tape, over regulation, and bureaucracy,” Ramaswamy added. “We will lead Ohio to be the top state in the country where we lead the way in the sectors of the future, from semiconductors to aerospace.

        "full_text": "ESPN host Stephen A. Smith challenged Whoopi Goldberg during “The View” on Tuesday over the Democratic Party’s messaging problem after the liberal host attempted to defend the messaging by comparing it to President Donald Trump.\n\n“If you think about him being impeached twice, 34 felony convictions, and they still elected him president, it’s not about him winning. It was an indictment against the Democratic Party and what the Democratic Party was offering to American citizens. We might sit up there and talk about, ‘Hey, you should be a party for the working class,’ which the Democrats was once known for. They’re not known for that right now. Why? Because their message was catering towards others and other issues, and they forgot about the people that brought them there, that elevated the Democratic Party to what it was over the last few decades. That’s why they lost. He didn’t win. The Democrats lost,” he told the co-hosts of “The View.”\n\nSmith, a Trump critic, has regularly criticized the Democratic Party and their messaging ahead of the election as well as after Trump won.\n\nCo-host Whoopi Goldberg attempted to push back on Smith and said she wanted to remind people of what those issues were, arguing they included, “Making sure that families had what they need. SNAP, making sure stuff is there. Making sure that the America that we all grew up in where you could come and be whoever you were supposed to be or want to be, you still have that right. All these things are the things that the Democrats have always said.”\n\nShe then compared that to President Donald Trump’s early executive actions, specifically in cutting federal jobs, as Smith pushed back.\n\n“Before you brought that up, you brought up the message that the Democratic Party was disseminating. I’m challenging you on that. That is not what they were doing,” he said.\n\nGoldberg shot back, “Oh, yes, it was. I was here. We did it.”\n\nSmith went on to argue that Biden contributed to a major migrant crisis and wondered why, pointing out that former President Barack Obama deported more migrants than Trump.\n\n“The bottom line, you’re Joe Biden, you open borders. Now, remember, Barack Obama deported more people than Trump did. You know what he didn’t do, he didn’t stick out his chest and bloviate about it, he just did it. What does Joe Biden do? Who is the Democrat, who is the vice president under Barack Obama? He opens borders. Over 12-plus million people entered the country. You had stuff going on in the streets, there was a migrant crisis,” Smith said.\n\nIn the second segment, Smith made the argument that Trump did have a mandate from the American people, pointing to his gains within minority groups.\n\n“If you’re the Democratic Party and you lost 49.8% to 48.3%, and looking at that 1.5% difference, that’s an excuse to say, what we did really wasn’t that bad, we should continue to do that. No, don’t continue to do it, find a new strategy,” he said.\n\nSmith demanded to know what Democrats were doing to win future elections, and said he would continue to interview prominent Democratic figures and ask them that question.\n\n“I want somebody to step up and recognize that man in the Oval Office, whether you like it or not, is potent, he’s coming, and he wins, you got to find a way to beat him,” he said.",

        "full_text": "1 hour ago\n\nJude Sheerin\n\nBBC News, Washington\n\nPresident Donald Trump declared \"the American Dream is unstoppable\" as he addressed a raucous joint session of the US Congress for the first time since he returned to power.\n\nIn the longest presidential speech to lawmakers on record, he outlined his vision for his second term, as Republicans applauded a high-octane six weeks that has reshaped domestic and foreign policy.\n\nTrump was heckled by Democrats and he goaded them in turn during the rowdy primetime address.\n\nThe Republican president has moved to slash the federal workforce and crack down on immigration, while imposing tariffs on America's biggest trading partners and shaking up the transatlantic alliance over the war in Ukraine.\n\nHere are six of the key takeaways.\n\nTrump predicts a bumpy ride ahead on tariffs\n\nFollowing a second day of market turbulence, Trump played down the potential economic fallout from a trade war he ignited this week, including 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% on Chinese imports.\n\nBut in contrast with the ovations that greeted his other policy objectives, many Republicans remained seated, a sign of how Trump's import taxes have divided his party.\n\n\"Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again,\" he said.\n\n\"And it's happening. And it will happen rather quickly. There'll be a little disturbance, but we're okay with that. It won't be much.\"\n\nTrump added that reciprocal tariffs tailored to US trading partners would \"kick in\" on 2 April.\n\nEarlier in the day, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox Business that Trump could announce a trade deal with Mexico and Canada as soon as Wednesday.\n\nTrump will 'probably' cut tariffs, says commerce chief\n\nWhat are tariffs, and why is Trump using them?\n\nA minerals deal with Ukraine looks back on\n\nTrump said he had received an \"important letter\" from Ukraine's leader earlier in the day, which appeared to match what Volodymyr Zelensky posted publicly on social media.\n\nUkraine's president had said he was now ready to work under Trump's \"strong leadership\" to end the war and \"come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer\".\n\n\"I appreciate that he sent this letter,\" Trump told lawmakers.\n\nZelensky offered the olive branch a day after Trump paused all military aid to the beleaguered US ally.\n\nIt followed an acrimonious Oval Office meeting last week when the two leaders argued in front of TV cameras, before cancelling plans to sign a minerals deal that would allow the US to profit from an economic partnership involving Ukraine's resources.\n\nTrump was reportedly hoping to announce during his speech to Congress that the deal had finally been sealed. But it did not materialise.\n\nLive updates: Trump 'appreciates' Zelensky's message\n\nTrump and Zelensky's fraying relationship, in their own words\n\nGreenland is in his sights, Lesotho isn't\n\nDespite most of his 99-minute speech focusing on domestic issues, Trump's worldview also came more sharply into focus.\n\nThere are places in the world he wants to expand US influence and others where he wants to withdraw.\n\nRepeating his desire for the US to acquire Greenland, he vowed \"we're going to get it - one way or the other\". And he said his administration would \"reclaim\" the Panama Canal.\n\nThere were several mentions of African countries when he rattled through a list of what he described as wasteful spending under his predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\nLiberia, Mali, Mozambique and Uganda were all places unfairly benefiting from US aid, he said.\n\nBut his most pointed remark was about Lesotho, which he said was a country \"nobody has ever heard of\" despite receiving $8m (£6.2m) to promote LGBT rights.\n\nWhy does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?\n\nHe stood by Musk despite protests over cuts\n\nEarly on Trump name-checked his billionaire adviser Elon Musk, who was watching from the gallery.\n\nThe tech mogul's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) taskforce has moved to fire tens of thousands of federal workers, cut billions of dollars in foreign aid and slash programmes across the US government.\n\nThe SpaceX and Tesla boss, wearing a dark suit with a blue tie, stood and acknowledged the cheers from the crowd.\n\n\"Thank you, Elon,\" the 78-year-old president said. \"He's working very hard. He didn't need this.\"\n\nMusk's cuts have sparked some angry scenes at town hall meetings and his instructions to federal employees have at times been overruled by members of Trump's cabinet.\n\nIn the chamber, Democratic lawmakers held up signs saying \"Musk steals\" and \"false\".\n\nDoge claims to have saved $105bn already but that figure can't be independently verified. Receipts have been published for $18.6bn worth of savings but accounting errors have been reported by US media outlets that have analysed the figures.\n\nYoung Republicans cheer Trump on from Texas watch party\n\nDemocratic pushback was loud and it was pink\n\nWithin the first five minutes of the address, Al Green of Texas was escorted out of the chamber by the sergeant-at-arms after refusing to comply with the House Speaker's demands that he stop heckling the president and take his seat.\n\nAs Trump spoke, other Democrats held up signs saying \"This is a lie\".\n\nWith Republicans in control of the White House, House of Representatives and Senate, Democrats have been largely leaderless as they work to hone their message and counter the blitz of activity from the Trump administration.\n\nMany Democratic women arrived in the House chamber wearing pink pantsuits in protest. Dozens from their party – some of them wearing the words \"Resist\" printed on the backs of their shirts - exited the chamber during the speech.\n\n\"There is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy,\" Trump said, appearing to revel in the partisan rancour.\n\nDemocratic leadership chose Elissa Slotkin of Michigan - a first-term senator elected in a battleground state that Trump won in November - to deliver the party's official response.\n\nShe accused Trump of an \"unprecedented giveaway to his billionaire friends\" and warned \"he could walk us right into a recession\".\n\nHe's betting on energy to bring down inflation\n\nTrump pledged to voters that he would beat inflation on his return to office and he used the speech to say his focus would be to reduce the cost of energy, by opening up the country to new oil and gas drilling.\n\n\"We have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on earth, and by far, and now I fully authorize the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it. It's called drill, baby, drill.\"\n\nThe soaring cost of eggs has been headline news in recent weeks, and Trump made clear who he felt was responsible.\n\n\"Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control - and we are working hard to get it back down,\" he added.\n\nEgg prices rose as the Biden administration directed millions of egg-laying birds to be culled last year amid a bird flu outbreak, though prices have continued rising in Trump's fledgling presidency.\n\nInflation was slightly elevated at 3% last month, but way down from its peak of 9.1% in 2022.\n\nOnly one in three Americans approve of Trump's handling of cost of living, according to a Reuters/Ipsos survey on Tuesday.\n\nFact-checking Trump's address to Congress\n\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "full_text": "Summary Chaos in legislature as opposition protests Demonstrations are major threat to Vucic Major Belgrade protest planned for March 15 BELGRADE, March 4 (Reuters) - Serbian opposition lawmakers threw smoke grenades and used pepper spray inside parliament on Tuesday to protest against the government and to support demonstrating students , with one legislator suffering a stroke during the chaos. Four months of student-led demonstrations , sparked by the deaths of 15 people when a railway station roof collapsed , have drawn in teachers, farmers and others to become the biggest threat yet to President Aleksandar Vucic's decade-long rule, with many denouncing rampant corruption and incompetence in government. At the legislative session, after the ruling coalition led by the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) approved the agenda, some opposition politicians ran from their seats towards the parliamentary speaker and scuffled with security guards. Others tossed smoke grenades and used pepper spray. A live TV broadcast showed black and pink smoke billowing inside the parliament, which has seen brawls before, in the decades since the introduction of multi-party democracy in 1990. Vucic later said authorities would hold all those deputies involved in the fracas to account, calling it \"hooliganism\". Under Serbian law, parliamentary deputies enjoy immunity from prosecution but can lose it if they commit serious crimes. POLITICIAN HURT Speaker Ana Brnabic said three lawmakers were injured and one, Jasmina Obradovic of the SNS party, had suffered a stroke and was hospitalised. Zlatibor Loncar, the Health Minister later said Obradovic was in a serious condition.

SERBIAN PARLIAMENT POOL / VIDEOPLUS/Handout via REUTERS , As the session continued, ruling coalition politicians debated while opposition lawmakers whistled and blew horns. Opposition deputies also held signs reading \"general strike\" and \"justice for those killed\", referring to those who died when the station roof collapsed in the city of Novi Sad last November. Outside parliament hundreds of protesters stood in silence to honour those killed. Protest leaders called for a major rally in the capital Belgrade on March 15. The ruling coalition says Western intelligence agencies are trying to destabilise Serbia and topple the government by backing the protests. \"We have a proposal ... to have a transitional government,\" Radomir Lazovic of the opposition Green-Left Front told supporters in front of the parliament. The opposition says a transitional government should secure conditions for free and fair elections, but Vucic and his allies have so far rejected that demand. \"This was a failed attempt of the ruling coalition to show it is in control ..., and (there's) a potential for an escalation,\" Radivoje Grujic, a Warsaw-based consultant told Reuters, commenting on the parliamentary session. Parliament was due to adopt a law increasing funds for universities - one of the main demands of protesting students. But other items put on the agenda by the ruling coalition including the one about noting the resignation of Prime Minister Milos Vucevic angered the opposition.

        "full_text": "The Trump administration on Tuesday re-designated the Houthi militant group in Yemen as a foreign terrorist organization, reversing a decision made by President Joe Biden in 2021, after more than a year of attacks on U.S. Navy and commercial vessels at sea.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement that he was fulfilling one of President Donald Trump’s campaign promises after hundreds of Houthi attacks on vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The Houthis have described their campaign of violence as an act of solidarity with Hamas, the militant group whose attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, triggered a war in Gaza that has upended security across the region.\n\n“Today’s action taken by the State Department demonstrates the Trump Administration’s commitment to protecting our national security interests, the safety of the American people, and the security of the United States,” Rubio said. “Terrorist designations play a critical role in our fight against terrorism and are an effective way to curtail support for terrorist activities.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRubio also warned China and other countries that may seek to maintain ties with the Houthis, noting that a recent attack “spared Chinese-flagged ships while targeting American and allied vessels.” The United States, Rubio declared, “will not tolerate any country engaging with terrorist organizations like the Houthis in the name of practicing legitimate international business.”\n\nThe group, formally known as Ansar Allah, was already the subject of earlier U.S. sanctions and other punitive measures, but the foreign terrorist designation makes it a crime for people or entities such as banks to offer “material support or resources” to the Houthis and bars its members from the United States.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Justice Department said it is offering up to $15 million for information leading to the disruption of the Houthis’ finances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Houthis, a rebel group that seized the Yemeni capital of Sanaa in 2014, function as the de facto government across a wide swath of Yemen, including in many of its most populous areas. Relying heavily on weapons provided by Iran, the Houthis have aligned themselves with other regional militant groups and positioned themselves as a leader of the armed opposition to Israel and the United States.\n\nShortly before departing office in January 2021, the first Trump administration designated the Houthis a foreign terrorist organization, citing cross-border violence into Saudi Arabia and an attack on an airport in Aden, a southern Yemeni city. The Biden administration undid that designation the following month, citing the limitations it placed on delivering humanitarian aid to Yemen, where a decade of civil conflict has fueled severe poverty and malnutrition.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Hamas attack in October 2023, Houthi leaders said they would attack ships associated with Israel. The campaign that followed was often indiscriminate, however, with vessels from a variety of countries targeted and at least a couple that were sunk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Biden administration responded by recruiting partners and allies to join a multinational naval task force to protect shipping and eventually launching airstrikes at the Houthis. Biden administration officials also sought to curtail weapons smuggling from Iran to Yemen, but officials familiar with the issue said that effort was difficult.\n\nThe U.S. military increased its tempo of strikes on Houthi targets in the final weeks of the Biden administration in response to what former U.S. officials said was an increasingly aggressive campaign to strike both Israeli and U.S. assets in the region.\n\nOn Tuesday, Houthi authorities announced they had shot down an American MQ-9 Reaper drone over Yemeni airspace in Hodeida governate, in what they said was the 15th downing of enemy aircraft since Hamas’s October 2023 attack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA U.S. defense official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said the U.S. military had lost contact with an MQ-9 over the Red Sea on Monday. “We are actively assessing the incident to determine the cause and follow-on actions,” the official said.\n\nFormer officials said the Biden administration developed a proposal that would have re-designated the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization late last year, but officials ultimately decided to leave that decision to the incoming Trump administration.\n\nU.S. officials have said that while Iran has provided significant support to the Houthis, they see the group as an independent actor that might not necessarily respond to Tehran’s instructions to stand down its maritime attacks. The Houthis have also established their own substantial, independent weapons production capability.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMohammed Al-Basha, a Yemen analyst, said the designation may result in additional U.S. steps to isolate the Houthis financially and logistically, such as cutting off the access of Yemeni banks from the global banking system. But he also noted that the group could attempt to evade the measures by working with Russia or other actors to obtain fuel or other imports.\n\nThe Houthis have largely halted their attacks on commercial and naval vessels following Israel’s ceasefire with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Al-Basha said, but Houthi officials have warned they will resume drone and missile strikes should the deal break down.\n\nAid groups have warned about the humanitarian impact of a re-designation. In a January statement following the Trump administration’s announcement that it intended to target the Houthis, Oxfam America said that Trump’s previous designation had damaging impacts on imports and commerce even before it took effect.\n\n“We know that humanitarian exemptions weren’t enough to stop the immediate impacts,” Scott Paul, the group’s peace and security director, said in January. “Even with those caveats, exporters canceled contracts, banks prepared to scale back, and humanitarian organizations began to plan for a dramatic escalation with even fewer resources and more constraints.”",

        "full_text": "Linda McMahon, the new secretary of Education, sent out the agency’s “final mission” message to staffers after her confirmation vote on Monday, previewing President Trump’s plans to roll up the department.\n\nIn her message, McMahon said she is ready to take on one of Trump’s “most momentous campaign promises to families” and “send education back to the states.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly expressed desire to eliminate the federal Education Department, saying before McMahon’s party-line Senate confirmation that he had told her to put herself “out of a job.”\n\nThe message focused on the department’s “new era of accountability” and how the upcoming months of cutting bureaucracy from the agency will lead to big changes.\n\n“This restoration will profoundly impact staff, budgets, and agency operations here at the Department. In coming months, we will partner with Congress and other federal agencies to determine the best path forward to fulfill the expectations of the President and the American people. We will eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy so that our colleges, K-12 schools, students, and teachers can innovate and thrive,” McMahon said.\n\nShe laid out the three convictions staffers will need to have: parents should choose their children’s education; taxpayer-funded schools are for math and reading, “not divisive DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] programs and gender ideology;” and postsecondary education should be for creating well-paying jobs useful to the workforce.\n\n“Removing red tape and bureaucratic barriers will empower parents to make the best educational choices for their children. An effective transfer of educational oversight to the states will mean more autonomy for local communities. Teachers, too, will benefit from less micromanagement in the classroom — enabling them to get back to basics,” McMahon said.\n\nThe new Education secretary also mentioned Trump’s executive orders promoting school choice and ridding schools of critical race theory and DEI programs.\n\nThe message comes after dozens of staffers have already been put on administrative leave and millions of dollars in federal education contracts have been canceled as Trump and Elon Musk move to dramatically reshape and reduce the federal government.\n\nWhile the future is uncertain for Education Department employees, McMahon said, “every staff member of this Department should be enthusiastic about any change that will benefit students.”",

        "full_text": "President Trump will address Congress on Tuesday night to sell his vision for his second administration, as he remakes American government and tests the limits of executive power.\n\nThe speech comes after a blitz of executive actions seeking to purge a federal bureaucracy he views as disloyal and otherwise reshape domestic and foreign policy. In pursuing his agenda, Mr. Trump has repeatedly made false statements and claims lacking evidence, including that Ukraine started the war with Russia and that diversity programs at the Federal Aviation Administration led to a plane crash this year.\n\nThe president’s address is expected to touch on the major cuts that he and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency have ordered for federal programs and the government’s work force. He is also expected to trumpet his immigration crackdown and his moves to impose steep tariffs in an effort to bolster domestic manufacturing.\n\nMr. Trump’s remarks on these issues over the past few weeks offer a preview of possible talking points. Here’s a fact-check:\n\nWhat Was Said\n\n“We were richest — the richest, relatively — from, think of this, from 1870 to 1913. That was our richest because we collected tariffs from foreign countries that came in and took our jobs and took our money, took our everything, but they charged tariffs.”\n\n— at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 22\n\nFalse. Mr. Trump is wrong that the United States was richest during the Gilded Age, and he is overstating the impact of tariffs. He is also wrong that the country grew less prosperous in 1913, when a permanent federal income tax was introduced.\n\nA White House spokeswoman noted that wages and the economy grew rapidly during the Gilded Age, but did not provide evidence of unparalleled prosperity in that era. The United States is far richer now than it was during that time, even when accounting for inflation. From 1870 to 1913, the country’s gross domestic product grew to nearly $1 trillion from about $190 billion, and to $10,000 from $4,800 per capita. Those figures have continued to rise precipitously, reaching nearly $20 trillion and more than $58,000 per capita in 2022.\n\nRelative to other countries, the United States was just as rich or richer in the post-World War II era than in the Gilded Age. The United States was the third-largest economy in 1870, after China and India, but had become the world’s largest by 1920, making up about 23 percent of global G.D.P. It remained the world’s largest economy until 2014, when China took the lead.\n\nInequality, though, reached a peak during the Gilded Age. The United States had one of the highest rates of economic disparity in the world in 1910. Estimates of U.S. inequality, using a standard global metric, fell after the introduction of taxes aimed at wealthier people but rebounded somewhat in recent decades.\n\nThe U.S. economy did grow at a rapid clip in the Gilded Age, but tariffs were not the sole factor, said Richard White, a historian at Stanford University and an expert on the Gilded Age. He noted other reasons, including the U.S. seizure of Native land and the population’s doubling from 1860 to 1890, in large part because of immigration.\n\nWhat Was Said\n\n“We have found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud so far.”\n\n— before a bilateral meeting with President Emmanuel Macron of France on Feb. 24\n\nThis lacks evidence. The White House spokeswoman said the Department of Government Efficiency had identified hundreds of billions of dollars in fraud in the federal government. But even the government overhaul team itself does not purport to have found that much in specific savings or fraud.\n\nAccording to Mr. Musk’s team, it has generated $105 billion in savings, as of Sunday. The initiative’s website includes details for canceled contracts that it says total about $8 billion in savings and broad descriptions for around $10 billion in terminated grants and $660 million in terminated leases. That’s a total of less than $20 billion, with the rest appearing unexplained.\n\nAs The New York Times and other news outlets have documented, the roughly $20 billion in savings is also not verified. The initiative has updated its website periodically to address mistakes such as contracts erroneously listed as worth billions but actually worth millions, contracts that were counted multiple times and contracts that have long ended or were not actually canceled.\n\nThe federal Government Accountability Office estimated last year, before the creation of DOGE, that the government loses $233 billion to $521 billion a year to fraud. But it is unclear if any of the Trump administration cuts announced thus far were canceled payments for fraudulent services.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump and other officials have cast spending with which they disagree as wasteful, fraud involves deception or misrepresentation. For example, DOGE has said that it has canceled leases at underused and vacant properties and that there is “plenty of available office space for the current workforce.” It did not mention fraud in those leases.\n\nWhat Was Said\n\n“Europe has given $100 billion. The United States has given $350 billion because we had a stupid, incompetent president and administration, 350. But here’s worse: Europe gave it in the form of a loan; they get their money back.”\n\n— at CPAC on Feb. 22, in reference to aid to Ukraine\n\nThis is exaggerated. Mr. Trump is overstating the United States’ financial support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s invasion, understating Europe’s, and misrepresenting the proportion of loans and grants that each has given.\n\nOfficial and independent estimates of American aid to Ukraine show it is about half of Mr. Trump’s figure. The Congressional Research Service reported that Congress has appropriated $174 billion in aid for Ukraine since the 2022 fiscal year. The Pentagon’s inspector general estimated that figure was about $182 billion.\n\nThe White House spokeswoman argued that there were tens of billions more in indirect costs, which she said included lost trade with Russia because of economic sanctions as well as the war’s inflationary impact. But lost trade and inflation also affected Europe, which was one of Russia’s biggest trading partners before the war. Mr. Trump, at other times, has conceded that the amount of aid the United States has provided to Ukraine might be less than $350 billion.\n\nThe European Union has estimated that its member states made available about $145 billion in aid, with tens of billions more committed.\n\nMr. Trump has a point that the bulk of American aid has been in grants and direct assistance rather than loans, but he is overstating the proportion of loans the European Union has provided.\n\nThe Pentagon’s inspector general noted that the United States provided about $20 billion, or roughly 10 percent of total aid, in loans. In comparison, the European Union says it has provided about 35 percent of total aid, roughly $50 billion, in loans.\n\nFaced with an expansionist Russia and an unpredictable American president, European leaders are also looking to increase their own military spending and shoulder a heavier burden in Ukraine’s and the continent’s defense.\n\nWhat Was Said\n\n“For four long years, you had a president who put illegal aliens up in penthouse suites and beautiful hotels on Park Avenue or on Madison Avenue or on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.” — at CPAC on Feb. 22\n\n“They sent $59 million to New York City for a hotel, for a little bit of nothing, what they’ve done. A hotel that was not luxury that’s getting luxury rates for migrants, where they’re making a fortune.” — at a swearing-in ceremony on Feb. 12\n\nThis is misleading. New York did house tens of thousands of migrants in hotels, but Mr. Trump is largely wrong about where the migrants were housed, the payments and the Biden administration’s role.\n\nIn 2023, Congress created the Shelter and Services Program, which in the 2024 fiscal year doled out about $640 million in grants to groups and localities that provide shelter and other services to migrants. The program does not directly pay for hotel rooms or decide where exactly migrants are housed.\n\nNew York City received around $190 million total in the 2023 and 2024 fiscal years, according to federal data.\n\nBut the city has spent far more than what it has received from the federal government to house migrants, as it sought to provide lodging beyond already-squeezed city shelters. According to a comptroller report, the city spent nearly $1 billion on housing migrants at 119 hotels from September 2022 to August 2024. Most were budget or midscale properties, receiving an average nightly rate of $156 in the 2024 fiscal year, compared with a cost of around $52 for a shelter bed. About 19 of the hotels were in Manhattan.",

        "full_text": "For much of the past decade, President Donald Trump and his allies have been waging a war against the so-called \"deep state\"—and the conflict has only escalated since Trump's return to power.\n\nThere's no official definition of the term, of course. Loosely, the deep state is the collection of bureaucrats, contractors, intelligence officials, and other official or even quasi-official entities that more-or-less retain their power no matter who occupies the White House or which party controls Congress. But it's more specific than that. Implicit in talk about the deep state is the idea that certain individuals outside the official chain of command wield the true power in the federal government, and that they frequently ignore or thwart the will of the people's elected and appointed representatives. In a nutshell, the deep state is undemocratic and unaccountable, even to powerful figures in the federal government.\n\nTrump has cast the deep state as one of the chief antagonists of his populist movement, in no small part because such movements always require enemies (and the less well-defined the better). Much of what the second Trump administration has done so far—from the mass firings of federal employees to the appointment of unorthodox leaders at the Pentagon, FBI, and other key outposts—is probably best understood as a direct assault upon this perceived opponent.\n\nBut at the same time that he's focused on dismantling the deep state, Trump seems to have built his own undemocratic, unaccountable executive apparatus.\n\nHow else should we view the incident that The Washington Post reported on last week involving Elon Musk, the unofficial head of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), and Secretary of State Marco Rubio?\n\nAs DOGE was slashing its way through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Rubio issued a waiver ensuring that \"existing life-saving humanitarian assistance programs\" should continue, despite the announced shutdown of USAID. \"Several times, USAID managers prepared packages of these payments and got the agency's interim leaders to sign off on them with support from the White House,\" the Post reported. \"But each time, using their new gatekeeping powers and clearly acting on orders from Musk or one of his lieutenants, [Luke] Farritor and [Gavin] Kliger would veto the payments—a process that required them to manually check boxes in the payment system one at a time, the same tedious way you probably pay your bills online.\"\n\nAs a result, USAID clinics that were supposed to be protected by Rubio's order were shuttered.\n\nThat is an almost perfect illustration of how conservatives used to believe the deep state operated—with unelected, unofficial back-channel operatives overruling the plainly stated instructions of those who are nominally in power.\n\nAnd, sure, much of USAID's spending seems to have been wasteful and in need of a thorough audit, if not a serious cut. Yes, you can also make whatever jokes you'd like about Rubio getting exactly what he deserves for becoming Trump's lackey.\n\nStill, this should be worrying to anyone who takes seriously the threat of the deep state or values the rule of law.\n\nWhatever your views of Musk and Rubio as individuals, it simply cannot be that the Senate-confirmed secretary of state is having his decisions overruled by a man (or his lieutenants) who still lacks any official place in the White House's organizational chart and who runs a rebranded version of the U.S. Digital Service, an agency meant to streamline the executive branch's digital outreach efforts that has no statutory authority to make spending decisions.\n\nIt's an encouraging sign that some Republicans are upset about this.\n\n\"Now that Marco is confirmed and in place, there should be nobody in the administration—outside of the president of the United States or at the direction of the president—that should pause, delay, or cancel anything Marco thinks is in our best national interest,\" Sen. Thom Tillis (R–N.C.) told NOTUS last week in response to a question about the Rubio/Musk turf war. Tillis also chalked up the incident to a case of having \"a lot of cooks in the kitchen\" but said there should be no doubt that Rubio, in this case, is \"head chef.\"\n\nMaybe it was all just a mix-up. But while the situation with USAID and Rubio is the most high-profile, it is not the only example of DOGE and Musk operating like the very deep state Republicans used to criticize.\n\nTake, for another example, how the Trump administration is working to exempt DOGE from the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). As Reason's C.J. Ciaramella reported, Justice Department lawyers are now arguing that the DOGE does not have to respond to FOIA requests because it is no longer part of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB).\n\nMuch of the office of the president is exempt from FOIA (the OMB is a bit of an outlier), but that maneuver still \"runs contrary to Trump and Elon Musk's promises and stated goals of delivering open, transparent government to the public,\" Ciaramella wrote. Indeed, Musk has claimed that \"all aspects of the government must be fully transparent and accountable to the people,\" Musk posted on X earlier this month. \"No exceptions.\"\n\nWell, some exceptions, apparently.\n\nMusk's role within the executive branch is starting to look every bit as vague and unaccountable as the shadowy deep state operatives that Trump campaigned against—and that lack of clarity might soon undermine some of what DOGE has accomplished. In a statement to a U.S. district judge in February, a White House attorney explained that Musk is a \"special government employee\" and an adviser to the president, not the actual head of the DOGE or even an employee of the department.\n\nSo who is running things? The White House said last week that Amy Gleason is now the administrator of the DOGE project. But Musk remains the face of the effort, and federal judges assessing the legality of DOGE's actions seem to have questions about the chain of command.\n\n\"Based on the limited record I have before me, I have some concerns about the constitutionality of U.S.D.S.'s structure and operations,\" Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said during a hearing in the federal district court last week. The New York Times notes that she \"expressed particular concern that [Musk's role] violated the appointments clause of the Constitution, which requires leaders of federal agencies to be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.\"\n\nYou have to assume that other federal judges hearing other legal and constitutional challenges to DOGE's spending cuts will soon be asking similar questions. Even if the Trump administration can fall back on the claim that those changes are authorized by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), judges are likely to look less favorably on these maneuvers if they appear to be happening on the orders of someone who holds no actual power (and, don't forget, runs a business empire that's significantly funded by government contracts).\n\nOverruling the decisions made by legally appointed officials. Dodging transparency. Refusing to identify who is running the show. Are Musk and the DOGE just the deep state by a different name?\n\nSome clarity and transparency from the White House about Musk's official status and the limits of DOGE's powers would go a long way toward establishing the necessary constitutional credibility to make any of these cuts stick—and would have practical benefits too, like clearing up whether federal workers are supposed to respond to his emailed demands.\n\nIt is fair to point out, as Reason's Christian Britschgi has, that Musk is not the first personal adviser to the president who has occupied an unclear and constitutionally dubious role while exercising vast, unofficial powers from the White House.\n\nBut Trump promised to demolish the deep state, not reshuffle the seating chart. Instead, he seems to be delivering a new version of the deep state, but one oriented toward conservative ends—which is, in fairness, what some conservatives wanted.\n\nThat might be good enough for some Republicans who can't see past the next election. Principled conservatives and libertarians, however, should balk at the constitutionally dubious nature of all this and recognize that a smaller government with a more powerful set of unaccountable executive officials is unlikely to be much of a win for liberty.",

        "full_text": "Update(1425ET): Is President Trump going to announce 'mission accomplished' on the Ukraine minerals deal during tonight's speech before a joint session of Congress? A breaking Reuters headline strongly suggests this is the case:\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump's administration and Ukraine plan to sign the much-debated minerals deal following a disastrous Oval Office meeting Friday in which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was dismissed from the building, four people familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has told his advisers that he wants to announce the agreement in his address to Congress Tuesday evening, three of the sources said, cautioning that the deal had yet to be signed and the situation could change.\n\nBut as we've seen in the last several days since Friday, a lot can happen in one afternoon. Zelensky gave an 'almost apology' on Tuesday (below), but not quite what the administration seems to be asking for.\n\nAs of yet, \"It was unclear if the deal has changed,\" Reuters notes. \"The deal that was to be signed last week included no explicit security guarantees for Ukraine but gave the U.S. access to revenues from Ukraine's natural resources. It also envisaged the Ukrainian government contributing 50% of future monetization of any state-owned natural resources to a U.S.-Ukraine managed reconstruction investment fund.\"\n\nA key caveat... we've seen these trial positive news balloons prematurely floated before:\n\nThis is all happening less than 24 hours after the Trump White House ordered an end to military aid to Ukraine, or at least a \"pause\". Zelensky has meanwhile declared he's ready to move forward under Trump's \"strong leadership\" - but we're unlikely to ultimately know for sure until Trump's address tonight. And then there's the question of if there will be a final signing ceremony, or if both sides have finally agreed to all the details, such as Zelensky's demanded strong security guarantees.\n\n* * *\n\nTrump wants an explicit public apology from Zelensky - that's according to Fox White House correspondent Peter Doocy, who described the following on Monday...\n\n\"Nothing is gonna happen with this minerals deal until Zelensky goes in front of cameras and makes an explicit public apology for the way he behaved in the Oval Office with that meeting,\" Doocy said in a live broadcast from the White House lawn. President Zelensky on Tuesday is reiterating he's \"ready\" to sign the minerals deal with the US.\n\nThis is because in the wake of the disastrous Zelensky visit, \"there's now quite a disconnect happening here at the White House with their allies in Kiev.\"\n\nAs for the requirement of a recorded apology by Zelensky to make amends, Doocy said he was specifically \"told by a senior official\" in the Trump administration.\n\nPresident Zelensky himself had this weekend said he still hopes for \"constructive dialogue\" with Washington and has expressed willingness to still sign the agreement.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio had just hours after Zelensky left the White House Friday advised the Ukrainian leader to apologize \"for wasting our time\" and for \"turning this thing into the fiasco for him that it became.\" Zelensky has still not done so. There are these 'regret' statements issues from his office Tuesday:\n\nthe way the White House meeting turned out was regrettable\n\nKyiv ready to work under 'Trump's strong leadership' for peace: Zelensky\n\nZelensky says wants to 'make things right' with Trump\n\n“My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump’s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts,” Zelenskiy said Tuesday on X. “The first stages could be the release of prisoners and truce in the sky — ban on missiles, long-ranged drones, bombs on energy and other civilian infrastructure — and truce in the sea immediately, if Russia will do the same.” Below is Zelensky's full, latest public statement:\n\nGOP Congressional leaders are meanwhile still holding out hope that a deal will be reached. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), a co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Ukraine Caucus, said he's confident a minerals deal will still \"be signed in short order.\"\n\nWatch Fox's Doocy explain what's required of Zelensky below, based on US admin officials...\n\n\"We are 100% getting this train back on the tracks,\" Fitzpatrick wrote on X on Monday. \"This mineral deal will be signed in short order, which will lead to a strong long-term economic partnership between the United States and Ukraine, and which will ultimately and naturally lead to security assistance.\"\n\nBut it sounds like from the White House's perspective a lot will be determined by Zelensky's actions in the coming days. Here's what US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told CNN on Sunday: \"it’s unclear whether President Zelensky, particularly after what we saw on Friday, is ready to transition Ukraine to an end to this war, and to negotiate and have to compromise.\" Waltz then said that \"we need a leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians, and end this war\" - in remarks that hinted at regime change in Kiev.\n\n* * *\n\nIs a full-on apology coming?...\n\n* * *",

He pointed to $1.3 billion Canada is spending on new security measures along the border.\n\nBoth countries called the link between fentanyl smuggling and trade barriers unjustified and announced plans to retaliate.\n\nPresident Trump is expected to speak about the clash Tuesday night in an address before Congress. In a statement Monday, the White House once again pointed to drugs as a key motivation for new U.S. trade barriers, describing the situation as a \"national emergency.\"\n\n\"While President Trump gave both Canada and Mexico ample opportunity to curb the dangerous cartel activity and influx of lethal drugs flowing into our country, they have failed to adequately address the situation,\" the U.S. statement said.\n\nThe U.S. on Tuesday imposed 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China.\n\nTrump has continued to describe fentanyl overdoses as an escalating crisis in the U.S., despite the fact that fatal overdoses have plummeted since 2023 — down nearly 24%, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nTrudeau says Canada will retaliate with tariffs on $155 billion of U.S. goods, phased in over the next three weeks.\n\nChinese officials said they too have already stepped up cooperation with the U.S. on drug interdiction efforts. Speaking Monday, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian accused the Trump administration of using \"the fentanyl issue as a pretext\" to threaten China.\n\n\"The U.S.'s attempts to politicize and weaponize trade and economic issues, levy tariff hikes on Chinese imports under the pretext of fentanyl, and create blocks to its normal trade, investment and economic cooperation with China will only harm its own economic interests and international credibility,\" Jian said.\n\nMany of the industrial chemicals used to make fentanyl — and other synthetic street drugs — have been linked to firms operating in mainland China. In the past, however, Chinese officials have described the fentanyl crisis as a domestic concern inside the U.S. that should be solved by curbing demand and street drug use.\n\nBeijing responded to the Trump administration's latest tariff hike by slapping additional tariffs of 10-15% on a variety of U.S. agricultural imports, including chicken, pork, soy and beef, starting next week, China's finance ministry announced.\n\nMexico has also stepped up law enforcement pressure on drug cartels, staging raids against fentanyl labs and arresting gang leaders. Last month, Mexico transferred 29 cartel leaders into U.S. custody.\n\nSpeaking on Tuesday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her country, too, would retaliate with 25% tariffs on U.S. goods.\n\n\"There is no motive or reason, nor justification that supports this decision that will affect our people and our nations,\" she said.\n\nSheinbaum said she would detail which American products and industries would be targeted on Sunday.\n\nData from U.S. Customs and Border Protection shows fentanyl seizures at the U.S.-Mexico border have dropped by roughly 50% in recent months.\n\nThis escalating trade fight comes at a time when fatal overdoses from fentanyl are plunging in the U.S., with deaths linked to the synthetic opioid down more than 30% over the last year, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

        "full_text": "California Attorney General Rob Bonta on Monday announced charges against 30 detention services officers who allegedly oversaw “gladiator fights” between minors at a juvenile detention facility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis development comes after leaked video footage showing one of the fights went viral on social media. The officers are facing a slew of charges, including “child endangerment and abuse, conspiracy, and battery,” according to a press release.\n\nThe indictment alleges that the officers allowed and, in some instances, encouraged 69 fights to occur between youths at Los Padrinos during the period from July 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023. The indictment stems from an investigation launched by the California Department of Justice after video footage of one of the so-called \"gladiator fights\" leaked in January 2024. Twenty-two of the 30 officers were arraigned today at Los Angeles Superior Court. The remaining officers will be arraigned on April 18, 2025.\n\nBonta said correctional officers “have a duty to ensure the safety and well-being of those under their care” and that the defendants “did just the opposite – overseeing ‘gladiator fights’ when they should have intervened.”\n\nThe video footage showed multiple youths taking turns punching and kicking a teenager in a “day room” in the facility. The officers can be seen standing around doing nothing to stop the assault. Some of them laughed and shook hands with the juveniles involved in the violence.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times obtained a copy of the video after the 17-year-old victim’s attorney requested that he be released before his upcoming trial because he was not safe at the facility.\n\nThe indictment alleges that the officers not only allowed the fights to occur – they actively supported it. One inmate suffered a broken nose and head trauma.\n\nThe officers allegedly doctored reports to give alternate explanations for the injuries the juveniles sustained from the fights. Officer Taneha Brooks in a report characterized one of the more severe assaults as a mutual fight that she stopped after intervening. Yet, the video footage clearly shows her doing nothing.\n\nLos Padrinos Juvenile Hall has an extensive history of safety violations and operational problems, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nCalifornia’s Board of State and Community Corrections ordered Los Padrinos closed late last year after it repeatedly failed inspections and was deemed “unsuitable” to house youths. The majority of the juveniles incarcerated in Los Angeles County are housed in Los Padrinos because the board previously shuttered the county’s other two juvenile halls — Barry J. Nidorf in Sylmar and Central Juvenile Hall in L.A. — following increases in violence and instability in the halls exacerbated by a staffing crisis.\n\nThe probation department refused the state’s order to close Los Padrinos, and state board members have said they don’t know what legal recourse they have to enforce it. The California Attorney General’s office has previously declined to address the issue.\n\nLos Angeles County Superior Court Judge Miguel Espinoza is weighing a request from the L.A. County public defender’s office to remove all of its clients from Los Padrinos, based on the board’s finding that its unsafe for youths.\n\n“The probation system and its underlying culture are broken,” Los Angeles County Public Defender Ricardo Garcia said in a statement Monday. “Accountability for those who have failed to protect our youth is long overdue—there is no justice in a system that abuses the very youth it is entrusted to care for.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe LA County Probation department released a statement in which it claimed “accountability is a cornerstone of our mission, and we have zero tolerance for misconduct of any peace officers, especially those dealing with young people in our system.”",

        "full_text": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that government spending could be separated from gross domestic product reports, in response to questions about whether the spending cuts pushed by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency could possibly cause an economic downturn.\n\n“You know that governments historically have messed with GDP,” Lutnick said on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.” “They count government spending as part of GDP. So I’m going to separate those two and make it transparent.”\n\nDoing so could potentially complicate or distort a fundamental measure of the U.S. economy’s health. Government spending is traditionally included in the GDP because changes in taxes, spending, deficits and regulations by the government can impact the path of overall growth. GDP reports already include extensive details on government spending, offering a level of transparency for economists.\n\nMusk’s efforts to downsize federal agencies could result in the layoffs of tens of thousands of federal workers, whose lost income could potentially reduce their spending, affecting businesses and the economy at large.\n\nAP AUDIO: The Trump administration may exclude government spending from GDP, obscuring the impact of DOGE cuts\n\nAP correspondent Julie Walker reports the Trump administration may exclude government spending from GDP, obscuring the impact of DOGE cuts.\n\nThe commerce secretary’s remarks echoed Musk’s arguments made Friday on X that government spending doesn’t create value for the economy.\n\n“A more accurate measure of GDP would exclude government spending,” Musk wrote on his social media platform. “Otherwise, you can scale GDP artificially high by spending money on things that don’t make people’s lives better.”\n\nThe argument as articulated so far by Trump administration officials appears to play down the economic benefits created by some forms of government spending that can shape an economy’s trajectory.\n\n“If the government buys a tank, that’s GDP,” Lutnick said Sunday. “But paying 1,000 people to think about buying a tank is not GDP. That is wasted inefficiency, wasted money. And cutting that, while it shows in GDP, we’re going to get rid of that.”\n\nThe Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis published its most recent GDP report on Thursday, showing that the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.3% in the final three months of last year.\n\nThe report makes it possible to measure the forces driving the economy, showing that the gains at the end of last year were largely driven by greater consumer spending and an upward revision to federal government spending related to defense. Still, the federal government’s component of the GDP report for all of 2024 increased at 2.6%, slightly lower than overall economic growth last year of 2.8%.\n\nIn the GDP report, government spending accounts for almost one-fifth of people’s personal income, which totaled more than $24.6 trillion last year. This includes Social Security payments, benefits for military veterans, Medicare and Medicaid and other programs. But the report also measures the amount of people’s personal incomes that are paid in taxes to the government.\n\nThe government is not always a contributor to GDP growth and can subtract from it, which is what happened in 2022 as pandemic-related aid expired.\n\nLutnick said that the Trump administration would balance the federal budget with spending cuts, saying that would help growth and reduce the interest rates paid by consumers.\n\n“When we balance the budget of the United States of America, interest rates are going to come smashing down,” Lutnick said. “This is going to be the best economy anybody’s ever seen. And to bet against it is foolish.”",

        "full_text": "The Supreme Court will hear arguments Tuesday in a $10 billion lawsuit Mexico filed against top firearm manufacturers in the U.S., alleging their business practices have fueled cartel gun violence.\n\nThe gun makers reject those claims. They appealed to the Supreme Court to overturn a ruling that let the lawsuit move forward even though U.S. law largely shields gun makers from lawsuits.\n\nDepending on how the court rules, it could also affect a narrow legal path that helped families of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School secure a $73 million settlement from the gun maker Remington.\n\nHere’s what to know about the case:\n\nMexico has strict gun laws and has just one store where people can legally buy firearms. But thousands of guns are smuggled in by the country’s powerful drug cartels.\n\nThe Mexican government says 70% of those weapons come from the United States. The lawsuit claims that companies knew weapons were being sold to traffickers who smuggled them into Mexico and decided to cash in on that market.\n\nThe defendants include big-name manufacturers such as Smith & Wesson, Beretta, Colt and Glock. The lawsuit is still in its early stages, and if the court does side with Mexico it would still have to prove the allegations.\n\nThe gun makers say there is no evidence the industry allows trafficking and they disagree with Mexico’s data about how many weapons originate in the U.S. The Mexican government, not U.S. gun makers, is responsible for enforcing the laws and fighting crime, they argue.\n\nThe industry is shielded from most civil lawsuits arising from crimes committed using firearms under a 20-year-old law, though Mexico has argued that it doesn’t apply to crimes committed outside of the U.S.\n\nThe gun companies are asking the justices to overturn an appeals court ruling that allowed the case to move forward.\n\nThe 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found it fell under an exception to the shield law for situations in which firearm companies are accused of knowingly violating the law.\n\nThat exception has come up in other cases.\n\nThe victims of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook argued it applied to their lawsuit because the gun maker had violated state law in the marketing of the AR-15 rifle used in the shooting, in which 20 first graders and six educators were killed.\n\nThe Supreme Court declined to hear that case. After reaching the $73 million settlement, the families said they hoped it would lead to more safety and accountability.\n\nDepending on how the justices rule, their eventual findings could narrow or close that legal path.",

        "full_text": "Investors entered the New Year cheerful about the prospects of a business- and crypto-friendly Trump administration. Yet two months into 2025, US stocks have lagged Europe and Chinese stocks, bitcoin is sliding and concerns about inflation are mounting.\n\nUS stocks largely slid Tuesday as investors digested a poor outlook from a consumer confidence survey that showed heightened concern about inflation. The Conference Board’s consumer confidence index saw its largest monthly decline since August 2021.\n\nThe Dow wavered Tuesday morning but closed at 43,621, or 0.37% higher, after rising in afternoon trading. The benchmark S&P 500 closed lower by about 0.47% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 1.35%.\n\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed lower for the fourth session in a row. All three major US stock indexes are in the red since President Donald Trump took office on January 20; the Nasdaq is down more than 1% since the start of 2025.\n\nUS stocks had rallied after Trump’s reelection in November and the S&P 500 closed at a record high just last week. Yet US markets are fretting as signs of lingering inflation are on the rise and uncertainty around Trump’s trade and tariff policy persists. Investor sentiment on Tuesday moved into extreme fear territory for the first time since December, according to CNN’s Fear & Greed Index.\n\nAs investors brace for uncertainty, they are likely moving away from stocks into safer assets like government bonds and dumping risky assets like cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, which surged as high as $106,000 around Trump’s inauguration, is down about 16% in the past month, trading around $88,000 on Tuesday.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year US Treasury slid to 4.29% on Tuesday as investors piled into bonds, signaling concerns about uncertainty and weaker-than-expected economic growth.\n\nWalmart, a bellwether for the US economy, spooked investors last week after it signaled slower sales in 2025 than previously expected.\n\nThe VIX, Wall Street’s fear gauge, surged Tuesday to its highest level this year before retreating.\n\nWhile US stocks might be stretched, global markets are shining. Europe’s STOXX 600 Index has gained almost 10% this year. In China, equities continue to outperform the US.\n\n“The release of DeepSeek’s LLM has reignited interest in China tech (now up over 35% from its January low), while the developments around Ukraine are triggering a surge in performance for European tech companies and companies exposed to potential reconstruction,” analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a February 25 note.\n\nTesting the bull market\n\nThe Dow and the broader S&P 500 have gained since Trump’s reelection in November and are still slightly in the green since the start of 2025.\n\nYet the S&P 500 posted back-to-back gains of more than 20% in 2023 and 2024, raising questions about whether the bull rally can continue in 2025.\n\nTech stocks, which pushed US indexes higher in 2024, have wavered in recent days. Nvidia (NVDA), Palantir (PLTR) and Tesla (TSLA) were leading the selloff in stocks on Tuesday. Palantir, a star of 2024, has fallen about 30% in the past five days.\n\nTesla shares tumbled 8.4% on Tuesday, bringing the company’s market value below the $1 trillion mark.\n\nTwo out of three traders believe the market is overvalued, according to Charles Schwab’s quarterly trader client sentiment survey. Yet bullish traders still outnumber bearish traders 51% to 34%.\n\n“It’s clear that the majority of traders believe there’s some froth in the market, but on balance they also feel like there’s still more room for the bulls to run,” said James Kostulias, head of trading services at Charles Schwab.\n\nWhile there is looming uncertainty, some strategists think fundamentals like strong corporate earnings will drive stocks higher.\n\n“While we continue to expect volatility ahead as investors grapple with the potential impact of Trump’s proposed policies, we believe markets are likely to refocus on fundamentals that should support the equity rally further,” said Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note Tuesday.",

American students will be permanently expelled or, depending on on the crime, arrested. NO MASKS! Thank you for your attention to this matter,” he added.\n\nTrump has leveraged federal funding several times already as a way to shape policy in schools, universities, and college campuses.\n\nRELATED — Mostly Peaceful! Bottles, Chair Thrown at NYPD During NYU Anti-Israel Protest\n\nFor instance, as Breitbart News first reported, Trump signed an executive order last month halting funding for schools and universities that impose coronavirus vaccine mandates on students.\n\nThe order would prohibit “federal funds from being used to support or subsidize an educational service agency, state education agency, local education agency, elementary school, secondary school, or institution of higher education that requires students to have received a COVID-19 vaccination to attend in-person education programs,” a White House document read.\n\nTrump also signed an executive order to defund K-12 schools that teach transgender ideology and critical race theory, as Breitbart News noted:\n\nThe order will give the Department of Education 90 days to create a plan about how to weed out CRT and radical gender ideology instruction in K-12 schools, according to a White House memo first obtained by the Daily Caller. Trump notably promised on the campaign trail to sign an order defunding schools that teach “Critical Race Theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content.”\n\nThe White House memo also reportedly states that the order will direct the Attorney General to work with state attorneys general and district attorneys “to file actions against teachers and school officials who sexually exploit minors or practice medicine without a license through ‘social transition’ practices.”\n\nTrump’s announcement Tuesday comes after college campuses and universities across the country were sites of pro-Hamas and anti-Israel protests during the end of the Biden administration.",

For the dozens of high-level officials President Trump has fired in violation of clear legal restrictions, he is likely to be at least somewhat vindicated by a Supreme Court that has been increasingly skeptical of laws limiting the president’s ability to fire at will.\n\nBut Mr. Trump is on decidedly shakier ground when it comes to how he has empowered Elon Musk, who is perhaps the most important figure in the new administration based on the efforts taken to reshape the federal government through his Department of Government Efficiency initiative. That’s most likely why the White House has tied itself in knots trying to explain to courts and to the public the nature of Mr. Musk’s role. Presumably, that’s because it seems clear that the Constitution does not allow it.\n\nThat’s true at the level of broad constitutional principles — particularly the principle that sovereignty flows from the people and that only officials selected through constitutional methods get to wield power in our name. This insight seems to undergird the growing mobilization against Elon Musk. Protesters at Tesla showrooms who are displaying signs that say “no one voted for Elon Musk” are making, intentionally or not, a constitutionally inflected claim.\n\nMr. Musk’s power also is squarely at odds with concrete constitutional provisions. While the Constitution is largely silent on removal — Mr. Trump’s arguments that the Constitution gives him limitless power to fire are atextual — the document is quite specific when it comes to appointment.\n\nSupreme Court cases make clear that individuals who serve in “continuing” positions and who exercise “significant authority” on behalf of the United States must be appointed consistent with the Constitution’s Appointments Clause. As far as I can tell, Mr. Musk hasn’t been.\n\nThe Appointments Clause — part of Article II, the source of Mr. Trump’s virtually boundless conception of presidential power — sets forth two methods of appointment of what are called “officers of the United States.” “Principal” officers must be nominated by the president and are subject to the advice and consent of the Senate. For “inferior officers,” the Constitution allows Congress to give the appointment power to the president alone — that is, without Senate confirmation — or to the head of a department, or to the courts of law. Inferior officers must be subject to the supervision of someone other than the president; if you report directly to the president, you’re a principal officer.\n\nThis means that the individuals who wield the most authority — principal officers — are subject to both the public scrutiny and the check that is supposed to be imposed by Senate confirmation.\n\nMr. Musk appears to be wielding significant power, as evidenced by his presence at the administration’s first cabinet meeting last week. He was the first to speak after the president’s introduction. He boasted about pushing federal employees to respond to an email about their work, inveighed about the federal deficit and casually disclosed that his team had inadvertently canceled funding for Ebola prevention — an error he claims was quickly rectified, but may not have been. The email he mentioned appears to have been dashed off without advance warning even to the cabinet.\n\nThe Supreme Court has found that a range of government workers exercise enough authority that they are officers and must be appointed through one of the methods outlined in the Constitution — including many who exercise far less authority than Mr. Musk appears to. In 2018, for example, the court held that administrative law judges at the Securities and Exchange Commission were officers of the United States. In a more recent decision, the court explained that “thousands of officers wield executive power” on the president’s behalf, power that “acquires its legitimacy and accountability to the public through ‘a clear and effective chain of command’ down from the president.”\n\nIndeed, the main basis on which Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the classified-documents case against Mr. Trump was that the special counsel Jack Smith was an officer of the United States who had not been constitutionally appointed. The specifics of her conclusion were highly dubious — but she was right that “the Appointments Clause is a critical constitutional restriction stemming from the separation of powers.”\n\nTwo legal cases are making the argument that Mr. Musk’s power cannot be squared with the Appointments Clause. They contend that if Mr. Musk is as powerful as he seems to be, he must be appointed consistent with the Constitution — and he’s most likely a principal officer, which means Senate confirmation.\n\nOne case, in Maryland, was brought by a group of current and former federal employees and contractors; another, in Washington, D.C., was brought by a number of states. In a hearing last week, the judge in the Maryland case, Theodore Chuang, said that he was “highly suspicious” of the administration’s explanation for Mr. Musk’s role and characterized its insistence that he has no formal role in the Department of Government Efficiency as apparently “factually inaccurate.”\n\nThe district judge in the Washington case has made clear that allegations suggest that Mr. Musk has “rapidly taken steps to fundamentally reshape the executive branch,” with no apparent “source of legal authority.” His actions appear to describe “precisely the ‘executive abuses’ that the Appointments Clause seeks to prevent.”\n\nBased on well-settled principles, these claims should succeed in the cases. The decisions are unlikely to invalidate what has been done to the federal government by those involved in Mr. Musk’s initiative — but they should say that Mr. Musk cannot continue to exercise this authority without a constitutionally permissible appointment.\n\nThere is no small irony in Mr. Musk’s exercising this amount of extraconstitutional authority. Mr. Trump’s allies have consistently alluded to the principle of democratic legitimacy in their broadsides against the administrative state. When Mr. Musk laid out the principles of DOGE in an opinion essay, written with Vivek Ramaswamy, they said that “most government enforcement decisions and discretionary expenditures aren’t made by the democratically elected president or even his political appointees” but by people who were, they stressed, “unelected” and “unappointed.” This, they said, is “antidemocratic and antithetical to the founders’ vision.”\n\nThe system the founders created includes clear requirements for ensuring legitimacy and accountability in positions of significant government power. Americans should insist that if President Trump wants Mr. Musk in government, there’s a way to do that: appoint him as the Constitution requires.",

        "full_text": "WASHINGTON — Congress is careening toward a government shutdown in just 11 days as the discord between the two parties over funding talks grows, with no clear path to reach a deal.\n\nThe government is set to run out of money at the end of next Friday, March 14. Republicans control the House and the Senate, but they need Democratic support to pass a funding bill as it is subject to the Senate's 60-vote threshold.\n\nHopes of a full funding deal have faded, so President Donald Trump and congressional leaders are falling back on a short-term bill to keep the government open on autopilot, most likely through the end of the fiscal year. But even that is running into obstacles.\n\n\"I'm not optimistic. I don't think we're going to have a budget,\" said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. \"My Democratic colleagues have been insistent that we include language limiting the involvement of the executive branch on spending decisions.\"\n\nDemocrats have pushed to include constraints on Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk's attempts to close down or slash agencies without congressional approval. But Republicans say that's a nonstarter as they support the Department of Government Efficiency-led budget cuts, which they say are about rooting out waste.\n\n\"Democrats have to help negotiate this, and they've to this point shown no interest in finding a reasonable solution for that,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nJohnson called for a measure \"to freeze funding at current levels, to make sure that the government can stay open while we begin to incorporate all these savings that we're finding through the DOGE effort and these other sources of revenue that President Trump's policies are bringing to the table.\"\n\nIn a statement Sunday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Democrats are interested in a deal that \"promotes the economic well-being, health and safety of everyday Americans.\" But he added that \"there has been zero outreach from the Trump administration and House Republicans have walked away from the negotiating table.\"\n\nThe White House sent Congress a request for add-ons to the bill — or \"anomalies\" — that include $32 billion in transfer authority for the Defense Department, which some Democrats consider a slush fund. The request includes a $20 billion cut to IRS enforcement and an increase in funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation operations. The document was viewed by NBC News and authenticated by two sources.\n\n\"I think the White House anomaly requests are completely inadequate,\" Sen. Patty Murray, of Washington, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said Monday when she was asked about the request. \"And again, the solution is in front of us: short-term CR, tell our committee to get to work. Democrats are at the table. We are ready to do that.\"\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the chair of the Appropriations Committee, told NBC News on Monday that she's \"working on a two-track approach\" that includes a full-year continuing resolution and a short-term bill of \"maybe a month\" to give more time for a detailed agreement.\n\nFor Johnson, the first question is whether he can find enough votes to pass a stopgap bill in the House with a narrow GOP majority of 218-215. That may require Democratic votes as scores of conservative Republicans routinely vote against funding the government.\n\nOrdinarily, Democrats support short-term bills en masse. But this time, the GOP's insistence on protecting or codifying the cuts by DOGE has given Democrats a point of opposition to rally around — after they've seen grassroots anger from federal workers and veterans. Democrats see the Trump-Musk effort as trampling on Congress' power over spending, and some say they won't support a bill that would let it continue.\n\nIn addition, at least two moderate House Republicans have already blasted the idea of another continuing resolution.\n\nRep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, argued that Congress needs to pass regular appropriation bills rather than kick the can down the road with a CR.\n\n\"I am a NO on the CR. Congress needs to do its job and pass a conservative budget!\" he wrote on X. \"CR's are code for Continued Rubberstamp of fraud, waste, and abuse.\"\n\nRep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., an Afghanistan and Iraq war veteran, slammed the CR, saying it wouldn't allow for much-needed additional military funding.\n\n\"A continuing resolution (CR) is bad for our military and weakens our national security,\" Bacon wrote Sunday on X, without saying how he'd vote. \"A CR means new weapons programs cannot get started. A year-long CR means we are not serious about building a military that will deter China, Russia and Iran.\"\n\nBut Bacon said Monday that White House officials reached out to him after his post and acknowledged that \"anomalies\" were needed to \"plus-up\" military spending.\n\nJohnson huddled with his GOP leadership team as lawmakers returned to the Capitol on Monday evening and got support for the CR plan.\n\nRep. Andy Harris, R-Md., the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, said he was on board, even though the stopgap measure doesn't codify the DOGE cuts cheered by the ultraconservative group. All Freedom Caucus members voted last week to pass a budget resolution that calls for raising the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.\n\n\"I think we're charting new territory here with President Trump and his striving to get government efficiency going,\" Harris said as he left the speaker's office.\n\nAsked whether he's worried about a shutdown, Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., a Freedom Caucus member, replied: \"Nah.\"\n\n\"This town is very interesting. Deals seem to, like, fall out of the sky when they need to,\" Donalds told NBC News while saying \"the Dems are being ridiculous\" by opposing DOGE cuts.\n\nRepublicans are seeking to juggle a funding bill with an unrelated effort to pass a huge party-line package to advance parts of Trump's agenda, which has drawn unified Democratic opposition.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said Democrats will continue \"telling the truth about what the Republicans are trying to do\" and said it's the majority party's job to make a serious offer.\n\n\"The Republicans have the majority,\" Warren told reporters Monday. \"They need to put forward a package that can pass the House and the Senate. That's their job.\"",

Subscribe here.\n\nWelcome to the Logoff. Today I’m covering another purge at the Justice Department, where Donald Trump’s administration is taking revenge against high-ranking career prosecutors who prosecuted Trump allies over January 6 and in other criminal cases.\n\nWhat’s the latest? The head of the Washington, DC, US attorney’s office demoted seven high-ranking prosecutors on Friday, Reuters reports, moving them to entry-level positions in a bid to force them to quit. Those demoted include:\n\nThe leader of the “Capitol siege prosecution unit”\n\nA prosecutor who worked on criminal cases against Trump advisers Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro\n\nProsecutors who worked on criminal cases against the heads of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, two far-right extremist groups that worked to steal the 2020 election on Trump’s behalf\n\nThe experienced attorneys will now mostly handle misdemeanors and low-level crimes. The demotions follow the January firing of US attorneys who prosecuted Trump over his attempt to steal the 2020 election.\n\nWhy were they demoted? Ed Martin, the Trump-appointed new head of the DC office, claimed the moves reflected a shift in priorities and a focus on local crime in DC. But the Trump-related experiences of the officials selected — and the move of experienced prosecutors to entry-level jobs — make it difficult to believe this wasn’t an act of retribution.\n\nThe Logoff\n\nThe email you need to stay informed about Trump — without letting the news take over your life, from senior editor Patrick Reis.\n\nEmail (required)\n\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

The demotions send a strong signal to prosecutors that there will be consequences for officials who try to hold Trump and his allies accountable to the law. It’s also another blow against the DOJ’s independence, as Trump works to remake law enforcement as a tool he can wield for political ends. And the move weakens the US attorney’s office in Washington, which is tasked with prosecuting abuses of power by some of the country’s most powerful people.\n\nAnd with that, it’s time to log off…\n\nVox’s Gray Area podcast this week is about the science of changing one’s own personality — how, why, and if one should endeavor to fix the parts of ourselves that we don’t like.

Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,\" Trump said in an address to Congress on Tuesday while quoting from the letter. Trump also said he had been in \"serious discussions with Russia\" and had \"received strong signals that they are ready for peace\". \"Wouldn't that be beautiful?\" he said. \"It's time to stop this madness. It's time to halt the killing. It's time to end this senseless war. If you want to end wars you have to talk to both sides.\" Trump was expected to further outline his plans for Ukraine and Russia in the speech to Congress , but did not reveal any further details on how he plans to end Europe's biggest conflict since World War Two. Trump said Ukraine was ready to sign a minerals deal with the U.S., which Washington says is crucial to secure continued U.S. backing for Ukraine's defense. Four sources told Reuters that the Trump administration and Ukraine plan to sign the deal in return for military aid, which Trump has paused. But later on Tuesday U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News, \"There is no signing planned,\" according to a post on X by a Fox reporter. Trump gave no further details on the minerals deal, leaving its fate unclear. Early on Tuesday, Zelenskiy pledged to repair relations with the U.S. after what he described as a \"regrettable\" Oval Office clash with Trump last week. Zelenskiy said he wanted to \"make things right\" and was ready \"any time and in any convenient format\" to sign the minerals deal, which he left on the table during a visit to Washington after the Oval Office argument with Trump. His statement came a day after Trump halted military aid to Ukraine, his latest move to upend U.S. policy and adopt a more conciliatory stance toward Russia. \"My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump’s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts,\" Zelenskiy said in his statement on X. The statement made no mention of the pause in U.S. military supplies. Zelenskiy's statement was clearly aimed at stressing Kyiv's gratitude following the explosive confrontation at the White House, at which Trump and Vice President JD Vance scolded Zelenskiy as insufficiently appreciative. \"We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence,\" Zelenskiy wrote. \"Our meeting in Washington ... did not go the way it was supposed to be. It is regrettable that it happened this way. It is time to make things right.\" Zelenskiy outlined a path towards a peace agreement, which he said could begin with a release of prisoners and a halt to air and sea attacks, if Russia did the same. \"Then we want to move very fast through all next stages and to work with the U.S. to agree a strong final deal.\" U.S. President Donald Trump meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 28, 2025.

REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo , GEOPOLITICAL SHIFT Earlier, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukraine's forces could hold their own on the battlefield against Russian troops, but that Kyiv would do everything possible to continue cooperating with the U.S. \"We will continue to work with the U.S. through all available channels in a calm manner,\" Shmyhal said. \"We only have one plan - to win and to survive.\" In Moscow, the Kremlin said cutting off U.S. military aid to Ukraine was the best possible step towards peace, although it was waiting to confirm Trump's move. U.S. Democrats have raised an outcry over Trump's abrupt pivot towards Russia, the most dramatic geopolitical shift in generations for Washington, where governments under both parties since the 1940s have prioritized defending Europe from a hostile Moscow. The chart shows the five donors that have allocated the most bilateral aid to Ukraine across sectors between Jan. 24, 2022 to Dec. 31, 2024. PRESSURE ON EUROPE The pause in U.S. military aid puts more pressure on European allies who have publicly embraced Zelenskiy since the Oval Office blow-up. Britain and France, whose leaders both visited the White House last week, have offered troops to help guard a potential ceasefire. On Tuesday, Germany's conservatives and Social Democrats announced proposals to set up a 500 billion euro ($531 billion) fund to help ramp up defence spending. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen unveiled proposals to mobilise up to 800 billion euros for EU defence spending. The 27-nation bloc holds an emergency summit on Thursday. French President Emmanuel Macron's office said the president had spoken with both the U.S. and Ukrainian leaders and welcomed Zelenskiy's will to re-engage with Trump. But French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou was sharply critical of Trump's move to pause military supplies. \"Suspending aid during a war to a country under attack means abandoning the country under attack and accepting or hoping that the aggressor will win,\" he said during a parliamentary debate. Ukrainians were stunned and many described Washington's move as a betrayal. Oleksandr Merezhko, head of the Ukrainian parliament's foreign affairs committee, said it looked like Trump was \"pushing us towards capitulation\". \"Yes, it is betrayal, let's call it like it is,\" said lawyer Olena Bilova, 47, in Kyiv. \"But let's hope that American civil society and the elites of the European Union will not leave us alone.\" ($1 = 0.9418 euros) Reporting by Olena Harmash and Yuliia Dysa, Andrea Shalal, Gram Slattery; Additional reporting by Idrees Ali, Erin Banco, Steve Holland, Lidia Kelly, Mike Stone, Jasper Ward, Patricia Zengerle and Pavel Polityuk; Writing by James Oliphant, Peter Graff, Alex Richardson, Nia Williams and Michael Perry; Editing by David Gregorio and Stephen Coates . , Erin Banco Thomson Reuters Erin Banco is a national security correspondent focusing on the intelligence community.

        "full_text": "Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans are accusing one another of “lying” about what a House Republican budget resolution means for Medicaid, and both sides have made misleading or speculative comments. There’s little doubt the health care program would face cuts under the plan — and it would have to if Medicare cuts are off limits.\n\nDemocrats have seized on the resolution’s call for the Energy and Commerce Committee to cut $880 billion in spending over 10 years. The committee’s options for those reductions are almost entirely in spending for Medicaid, a federal-state program that provides health care for low-income people, and Medicare, the federal program that covers seniors.\n\nRepublicans have said the legislation doesn’t pinpoint any specific changes to Medicaid, which is correct but sidesteps the reality that the bulk of the spending cuts would likely be to that program. Democrats, meanwhile, have speculated that hospitals and nursing homes will close, impacts that aren’t known without details of how federal spending will be trimmed and how states will react.\n\nThe resolution that narrowly passed the House on Feb. 25 along party lines has several legislative hurdles to overcome before any spending cuts materialize. Most notably, it still needs to pass the Senate, where some Republicans want to change the legislation. The budget resolution is the first step to Congress using a maneuver called reconciliation to extend the 2017 tax cuts, most of which are set to expire at the end of this year. Reconciliation enables a tax and spending bill to pass the Senate with a simple majority, rather than 60 votes.\n\nThe House resolution lays out the broad parameters of extending the 2017 tax cut provisions and enacting some new cuts, at a cost of $4.5 trillion over 10 years, and reducing government spending by $2 trillion over the same time period. Both houses of Congress need to agree on this or another budget framework before lawmakers can then propose legislation on the specific ways they would cut and spend their way to those figures. (See slide 11 here for a flowchart on the process from the Committee on a Responsible Federal Budget.)\n\nWe’ll go through several claims about the resolution.\n\nSize of Medicaid Cuts\n\nLawmakers have made conflicting statements about how much would need to be cut from Medicaid under the House resolution.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Pete Aguilar, Feb. 25 press conference: Now some of our friends on the other side of the aisle will say, “This is just a procedural step. Please don’t hold this vote against me.” Here’s the truth: This vote doesn’t just open the door for Medicaid cuts, it guarantees them.\n\nRepublican Rep. Steve Scalise, Feb. 25 press conference: The word Medicaid is not even in this bill. This bill doesn’t even mention the word Medicaid a single time. And yet, all Democrats are doing is lying about what’s in the budget because they don’t want to talk about the truth of what we’re voting to start.\n\nAs we said, the Senate would still need to pass the resolution, and lawmakers then would need to agree on the specific spending cuts. But Aguilar has a point that the $880 billion would have to touch Medicaid, unless lawmakers wanted to find the reductions in Medicare — which may be even more politically challenging. Plus, House Republicans already have talked about some options for Medicaid cuts, such as adding work requirements and finding efficiencies in the program.\n\nScalise is correct in saying the legislation doesn’t include the word “Medicaid.” But, again, there’s little doubt that the program would face spending reductions — and they could be substantial, as we’ll explain.\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan budget watchdog group, said in a Feb. 20 post that “it would likely be nearly impossible to meet the [$880 billion] target without including some Medicaid reductions.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Brendan Boyle, Feb. 25 press conference: If Energy and Commerce Committee said, “We don’t want to cut Medicaid, instead we will cut literally everything else we possibly can 100%,” that only gets you about halfway to the $880 billion. So, by definition, they have to, as a minimum, cut hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicaid.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Feb. 27 press conference: Republicans are lying to the American people about Medicaid. The Republican budget authorizes up to $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid by directing the Energy and Commerce Committee to find those spending cuts. Everybody knows who has had any connection to the congressional budget that if you are directing the Energy and Commerce Committee to find up to $880 billion, if not more, in spending cuts, that means Medicaid.\n\nAll $880 billion over 10 years doesn’t have to come out of Medicaid, as Jeffries suggested in a Feb. 27 news conference, but Boyle is correct that there’s no way to get around sizable cuts to Medicaid — unless, again, lawmakers turn to cutting Medicare.\n\nOn Jan. 27, President Donald Trump said he would again “pledge,” as he did repeatedly during the campaign: “I will not sign any bill that cuts even a single penny from Medicare or Social Security for our great seniors.” He has said similar things about Medicaid, though he has left open the possibility of cutting waste or “fraud” from all three programs.\n\nRobin Rudowitz, a vice president and director for the program on Medicaid and the uninsured at KFF, a health policy research group, told us that “the large majority” of the $880 billion “is likely to come out of Medicaid,” and if Medicare cuts are off the table, there’s “no other way to get to that magnitude of savings” without Medicaid cuts.\n\nCJ Young, a spokesperson for the Democrats on the Energy and Commerce Committee told us: “Of the funding that’s available for the Committee to cut, approximately 98% percent of that is either Medicare or Medicaid funding. So if you take Trump at his word that he’s not touching Medicare, then the vast majority of the cuts will have to come out of the safety net health care program.”\n\nWe asked a spokesperson for the Republicans on the committee about this, but we haven’t received a response.\n\nIn breaking down the numbers of what the Energy and Commerce Committee can trim, the New York Times said that if the committee eliminates all non-health care spending, “it will still be more than $600 billion short” of that $880 billion target.\n\n“The reality is that this 880 number is targeting Energy and Commerce, and the place where they have the ability to make cuts is going to be in Medicaid,” Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, told us.\n\nMedicaid is jointly funded by the states and the federal government; the federal share over the next 10 years is estimated at $8.2 trillion. So, it would be about an 11% cut if all $880 billion came out of Medicaid.\n\nMedicare spending over 10 years is even higher — approximately $15.8 trillion, according to this New York Times analysis. The Energy and Commerce Committee oversees about another $600 billion that it could trim, including money for the Children’s Health Insurance Program.\n\nIf this budget resolution moves forward, the committee would have to find the entire $880 billion in deficit reduction, Chris Towner, CRFB’s policy director, told us in an email. “If push comes to shove and lawmakers don’t think they can meet those instructions, they would need to amend the budget resolution,” he said.\n\nImpact of Potential Cuts\n\nDemocrats have claimed that hospitals would close and people would lose health coverage, while Republicans have said any cuts would be to waste, fraud and abuse. Without the specifics on spending reductions, the impacts aren’t known, but experts told us that large cuts in federal funding would leave states with budget gaps and tough choices on what to do about them.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Frank Pallone, Feb. 25, CNBC: Well, I think the problem is that the Republican leadership is lying to the rank and file Republicans. In other words, they know that these Medicaid cuts will really take away health care from so many people and close hospitals and close nursing homes.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ted Lieu, Feb. 25 press conference: And what does $880 billion of Medicaid look like? It means the shutting down of community health clinics, the shutting down of hospitals, the shutting down of nursing homes.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, Feb. 27, CNN: We’re going to take care of those who are rightful beneficiaries of the programs. We’re going to cut the fraud, waste and abuse out of Medicaid, and that’s where we’re going to get part of the savings to accomplish this mission. … There’s about $50 billion estimated that are lost every year in Medicaid just in fraud alone.\n\nTrump, Feb. 26, Cabinet meeting: We’re not going to touch it [Medicaid, Medicare or Social Security]. Now, we are going to look for fraud. I’m sure you’re OK with that, like people that shouldn’t be on, people that are illegal aliens and others, criminals in many cases.\n\nMedicaid is funded jointly by states and the federal government, which provides matching funds of at least 50%, as KFF explains. An expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act provides a match of 90% in federal funding. About 21% of the U.S. population, or 83 million people, have Medicaid coverage, including those with low income and disabilities, as well as seniors. Medicaid, not Medicare, covers long-term care expenses for the elderly.\n\nRudowitz at KFF told us that changes the federal government makes to Medicaid financing “really gets transferred to the states,” which then “have to figure out how they’re going to respond to those cuts.” She said states could raise revenue, make cuts to other parts of their budgets or cut their Medicaid programs — and the latter option could mean cutting coverage or benefits, or the payment rates to health care providers. “All states might respond differently,” she said.\n\nShe noted that while most of Medicaid’s enrollees are children and adults, most of the spending is for people with disabilities and seniors, because of their high health care costs.\n\nCuello at Georgetown told us an $880 billion cut is “gigantic” and “orders of magnitude too large to not be destructive.” He, too, said that the “final cuts might be made by states.”\n\n“So in other words, you might reduce state funding by some gigantic number, and then the state has to react to that, and we can’t predict, we can’t tell you exactly what they’re going to do,” Cuello said.\n\nWe asked if he thought the potential impact would be as severe as community health centers, hospitals or nursing homes closing, as Democrats have claimed. “Yes, I do,” he said. “I don’t think we can predict that that is going to happen exactly in every state. Those things are the downstream consequences.”\n\nCuello noted that rural hospital closure is already a problem. “And if you defund the system … there are going to be hospitals that go over the brink,” he said.\n\nIn a Feb. 20 post, CRFB identified what it called “state financing gimmicks” that it said could be changed or eliminated to save federal dollars. It said that “incremental policy changes could improve the integrity of the Medicaid program and prevent states from unfairly gaming Medicaid’s financing laws while also leading to savings.” One example is lowering or banning Medicaid provider taxes, which are now capped at 6%.\n\n“As we have discussed, states often tax providers up to 6 percent of providers’ revenue and then use those funds to remit payments back to providers, reporting the payments to the federal government in the process to collect matching funds,” which “essentially” boosts the Medicaid match, CRFB said. It estimated savings of $240 billion to $610 billion over a decade if provider taxes were restricted or eliminated, respectively.\n\nTowner told us his organization’s post showed that “finding Medicaid savings also does not necessarily mean slashing Medicaid or even benefits – there are lots of non-benefit savings options available that could be used to fulfill this savings.”\n\nRudowitz and Cuello, however, said that a reduction in provider taxes would still leave states with a budget gap for their Medicaid programs. Some could argue that there should be more transparency and restrictions on provider taxes, Rudowitz said, but on the other side, “there are tradeoffs and consequences” to states getting less in federal matching funds.\n\nAs for Johnson’s and Trump’s claims about finding fraud, that’s unlikely to result in a sizable amount of savings — and certainly not $880 billion, these experts said. Johnson referred to $50 billion in fraud in Medicaid each year, but the Government Accountability Office estimated that amount for “improper payments” in fiscal year 2023 not solely “fraud.”\n\nThe GAO said that improper payments include overpayments and underpayments or payments that shouldn’t have been made. That can include fraud, “but not all improper payments are the result of fraud,” the report said. It didn’t give an estimate for fraud, saying that “estimates of improper payments cannot be used to determine the extent of fraud in a particular program.”\n\nJohnson’s office hasn’t responded to our inquiry about his claim.\n\nOften improper payments are missing some documents or paperwork, Rudowitz and Cuello said, and it doesn’t necessarily mean the payment shouldn’t have been made.\n\nAndy Schneider, also a research professor at Georgetown’s McCourt School of Public Policy, wrote a January blog post about Medicaid fraud. He said that fraud does occur — mostly on the part of unscrupulous providers, who, when caught, are charged with crimes. But there isn’t a good estimate of how much fraud there might be.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services also provides estimates on improper payments and recommendations on how to reduce them, Schneider explained. HHS’ fiscal year 2024 report estimated Medicaid’s improper payment rate at 5.09%, or $31.1 billion for the year. Of this amount, 74.3% was classified as improper due to “insufficient documentation.” The report said: “The insufficient documentation errors include claims where information was missing, or states did not follow appropriate processes to determine if a payment was proper or improper.”\n\nAs Schneider said, “had the information been available, the claim may have been payable (or not).”\n\nIn his interview on CNN on Feb. 27, Johnson said adding work requirements was one possibility for cutting Medicaid spending (which would save about $100 billion over 10 years, according to the Times). But a per-capita cap on funding or reducing the federal match (measures that would save hundreds of billions more) weren’t being considered, he said.\n\n“Look, everybody needs to watch the process play out,” Johnson said. “It’s going to take us five or six weeks, probably, to dig through all those details and come up with the final proposal.”",

        "full_text": "This time, it’s Democrats who are itching for a fight — over the Department of Government Efficiency cuts that Trump has blessed and deputized mogul Elon Musk has gleefully carried out.\n\nSenior House Democrats have spent recent days privately surveying their members about whether they’d be willing to shut the government down over DOGE cuts, according to multiple well-placed Democratic sources I spoke to over the weekend.\n\nSo far, they’re encountering little resistance.\n\nDemocrats of all persuasions, even some centrists who have long been firmly anti-shutdown, feel that voting for a “clean” spending bill would be tacitly blessing Musk’s controversial work. Denying Republicans the votes they’ll need to keep the agencies open, they believe, would be the lesser evil.\n\n“Nobody wants a shutdown, but they don’t feel like aiding and abetting what’s happening, with Musk and Trump taking a wrecking ball to health care in particular,” said one senior House Democratic aide, who like others I spoke to was granted anonymity to speak candidly about internal party conversations. “Why would we be complicit in that?”\n\nA senior Democratic lawmaker was blunter: “At some point you’ve got to have a goddamn backbone. I am not giving them a blank check until September.”\n\nThat’s a big pivot from just a few weeks ago. In early February, I pooh-poohed the left’s push to use the March 14 government funding deadline to make a stand against Musk — and then heard from a number of senior Democratic officials on both sides of the Capitol who privately agreed with my assessment.\n\nA Democrat-induced shutdown, they agreed, would backfire on their party politically and only empower Musk even more to slash and burn his way through federal agencies. And they were frustrated with the base for not seeming to understand that playing with fire wasn’t the answer.\n\nNow, with the funding deadline less than two weeks away?\n\n“People now feel like the more perilous position is giving votes without the perception there’s been any change in accountability,” a second senior House Democratic aide told me. “The incentive structure right now is not to provide votes for them.”\n\nSure, you can chalk some of the shift up to negotiating tactics. Democrats want Republicans to put some policy handcuffs on Musk, something Republicans are firmly rejecting. House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole called it “a non-starter and battle they lost to the American people” on Monday.\n\nAnd Democratic leaders have every reason to amp up pressure on their GOP counterparts to deliver as many votes as possible, given their control of the House, Senate and White House. No reason to make it easy on them, even if there’s no real shutdown threat, right?\n\nBut that’s not how House Democrats are talking, even in private. During a recent meeting between Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and his committee leaders, top appropriator Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut steamed about how Speaker Mike Johnson was going to try to make them swallow the clean funding extension.\n\n“No fucking way!” she shouted, a person in the room told me. Jeffries didn’t push back, and now his leadership team is gauging whether his members are willing to take this fight all the way.\n\nUsually shutdown saber-rattling originates on the fringes of the two parties and gains momentum until leaders just can’t ignore it, lest they risk their own jobs. This time, however, the foment is coming from the leadership table itself — where there is growing anger over the lightning-fast Trump-Musk campaign to gut federal agencies and the glacial pace of court action to stop it.\n\nSome senior House Democrats believe the impacts of the DOGE cuts have already created a shutdown of sorts and that passing a clean funding extension would effectively green-light the status quo and potentially undercut pending court cases challenging Trump and Musk.\n\nMoreover, I am told, Democrats have been emboldened by recent polling showing that the public has started to shift against DOGE, as Americans hear more about potentially losing benefits and veterans getting kicked out of jobs. That’s to say nothing of the recent town-hall protests, where Republican lawmakers took an earful from constituents raging against DOGE.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Democrats up and down the leadership chain are hearing not only from the liberal base but people they consider more mainstream — donors, strategists and constituents who believe they need to show some fight, and fast.\n\n“It’s very hard to go back to those people and say, ‘Yeah, I voted for the status quo here and did nothing to stand up,’” the second House Democratic aide said.\n\nWhat might be even harder for House Democrats, though, is figuring out an endgame.\n\nSay Democrats vote against a clean spending bill in the House and allow a shutdown to occur: Musk might have dismissed tens of thousands of federal workers, but Uncle Sam still employs more than 2 million more who would be furloughed without pay.\n\nAmid the finger-pointing, Republicans would call vote after vote to reopen government agencies — casting Democrats as the ones who are repeatedly choosing to keep agencies shut and employees home without paychecks.\n\nThat’s tough terrain to fight from, politically speaking, and especially tough when you consider how a shutdown might undercut Democrats’ core message right now — that Trump and Musk are undercutting the services and benefits that millions of Americans rely on.\n\nRight now, senior party leaders are posturing, trying to cast Republicans as the unreasonable ones. “The only one who wants a shutdown right now is Elon Musk,” Senate Appropriations Vice Chair Patty Murray of Washington said Monday, calling for a “short-term” stopgap instead of the six-month bill Trump and Johnson want.\n\nJeffries over the weekend accused GOP leaders of “walking away” from funding talks, arguing that it’s on the GOP alone to fund the government since they control everything.\n\nTop Democrats know as well as anyone that’s not exactly true: Appropriations has to be bipartisan given the 60-vote threshold in the Senate, which is the leverage they have long used to counter Republicans’ proposed spending cuts. And that argument isn’t the kind of resonant message that’s capable of ultimately winning over the public.\n\nBut it turns out Democrats might have learned a lesson from the most recent GOP-instigated shutdowns — the multi-week affairs seen in 2013 and 2019 waged over health care and border policy, respectively: Winning isn’t always the point — sometimes, when dealing with an angry base, you just have to tilt at the windmill.",

The Nasdaq is down about 6.5% since since Trump took office on January 20.\n\n“Tomorrow, tariffs — 25% on Canada and 25% on Mexico,” Trump said during a press conference at the White House. “And that’ll start. … What they have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United States, in which case they have no tariffs.”\n\nTrump said the two trading partners had “no room” left to negotiate to avoid the levies and that he was using tariffs to “punish” countries that, as he put it, were taking from the US economy without giving enough in return.\n\n“They’re all set. They go into effect tomorrow,” he said.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Ottawa would immediately respond with tariffs on $30 billion of US goods if the Trump administration’s measures go into effect.\n\n“Canada will not let this unjustified decision go unanswered,” he said in a statement.\n\nTrump also signed an executive order on Monday raising tariffs on imports from China to 20%, up from 10%. Trump said the tariffs, aimed at bringing China to the table on curtailing fentanyl entering the United States, will be raised because Beijing has not done enough to stem the flow of illegal drugs.\n\nThe VIX, Wall Street’s fear gauge, surged to its highest point this year after Trump’s comments.\n\n“Due to the uncertainty surrounding the tariffs, the stock market has erased the gains from the ‘Trump bump’ following the presidential election and the expected upward pressure on prices is giving investors pause,” said Gustavo Flores-Macias, a professor of government and public policy at Cornell University.\n\n“For investors, 2025 can still be a positive year for stocks, but it may take all year to realize gains. And they may be modest,” said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group.\n\n“I’m still a bull,” Bolvin said.\n\nThe import taxes Trump imposed are significant — the largest in US-China history. The initial tariffs, which went into effect February 4, set in motion tariffs on $1.4 trillion of imported goods. That’s more than triple the $380 billion worth of foreign goods that were hit with tariffs during Trump’s first term, according to estimates from the Tax Foundation.\n\nChinese response\n\nA spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce said Tuesday the country was “strongly dissatisfied” and “firmly opposed” the additional tariff.\n\n“(China) will take countermeasures to firmly safeguard its own rights and interests,” the spokesperson added in a statement.\n\nBefore he became president, Trump pledged a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods, so the tariff level could rise still.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said at the press conference about tariffs on Canada and Mexico that global companies can avoid tariffs if they invest into production in the United States, like TSMC, the Taiwanese chipmaker at the White House on Monday to announce a $100 billion US investment.\n\nTrump’s tariffs will raise prices of imported goods, which could boost demand for goods produced in the US, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs. But they also noted that tariffs will have negative effects on some American businesses.\n\n“Tariff increases will also raise production costs for some domestic producers and will likely prompt foreign retaliation against some US exports, both of which could hurt domestic production,” they wrote in a note.\n\nUS stocks are “likely to be volatile” until Trump’s policies point toward being more growth-focused, said Jason Draho, head of asset allocation for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note Monday.\n\nDraho said he does expect future growth and maintains a “positive medium-term outlook.”\n\n‘Extreme fear’\n\nThe stock market began to slide Monday morning to begin the new month, as investors digested the latest manufacturing survey from the Institute for Supply Management. The survey showed economic activity in the manufacturing industry remained in expansion territory, yet slowed last month. Tariff fears dominated write-in responses to the survey.\n\nMarkets slid Monday afternoon after Trump posted on Truth Social that he plans to implement tariffs on “external product[s],” potentially including agricultural products. Trump’s post referred to his plan for reciprocal tariffs, set to take place on April 2, according to a person familiar, though it was not immediately clear how these tariffs would be implemented.\n\n“To the Great Farmers of the United States: Get ready to start making a lot of agricultural product to be sold INSIDE of the United States. Tariffs will go on external product on April 2nd. Have fun!” Trump said in the post.\n\nThe sentiment driving markets on Monday dipped into “extreme fear” after Trump’s confirmation that tariffs will go into effect on Tuesday, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed Index.\n\nThe stocks dragging markets lower on Monday included Nvidia (NVDA), which fell 8.7%.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury slid to 4.16%, signaling concerns about uncertainty and future economic growth.\n\nBitcoin traded around $85,600 on Monday afternoon, down 8.6% in the past day and largely erasing gains made after Trump on Sunday announced a strategic crypto reserve that would include bitcoin.\n\nMeanwhile, shares in defense companies in Europe soared to record highs on Monday as European leaders consider the need to re-arm amid less US support for Ukraine.",

        "full_text": "Authored by Nick Bryant\n\nWe’ve been bombarded by rumors of the Epstein List, which is thought to be the Holy Grail of the Epstein case. On Wednesday, March 26, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced on national television that the “Epstein files” were on her desk, and she was releasing them to the public the following day. She also declared that the “files” contained “a lot of flight logs” and “a lot of names.”\n\nUnfortunately, Bondi’s declaration was much ado about nothing. So, either she lied on national television, or she didn’t look at the documents on her desk before releasing them. In either case, her behavior was egregious.\n\nI uploaded Epstein’s Black Book to the internet in 2015, and I believe that’s the closest we’ve come to an Epstein List, because the Black Book contains the names of numerous perps. I also uploaded passenger manifests from Epstein’s various sojourns, which, I believe, contain the names of various perpetrators, too. The documentation I released in 2015 had exponentially more information on the particulars of Epstein case than the redacted dreck Bondi released on Thursday.\n\nIn the \"Epstein List\" or \"Epstein Files\" narrative, each acts like Epstein kept a list of his child molesting clients as if were a travel agent at the Jeffrey Epstein Travel Agency. The Epstein list narrative is problematic because the idea he just kept their names and numbers in his black book at best the Epstein list is wishful thinking, at worst it's a contrived meme.\n\nAccording to a New York Times Article from July 8th, 2018, federal authorities seized hundreds, possibly thousands, of sexually suggestive photographs of girls who appear underage as well as hand-labeled compact discs with titles like \"girls pics nude\" and with the namess redacted like \"young [redacted] plus [redacted]\". Judging by the titles on the discs Epstein was a purveyor of child rap material. The latter disc named by the New York Times is perhaps an indication of blackmail.\n\nA New York Times article from August 29th, 2019 names Ghislaine Maxwell, Sarah Kellen Leslie Groff, Adriana Ross Nadia Marcinkova, and Haley Robson as procurers or otherwise pimps for the Epstein criminal enterprise. The case that put Maxwell in prison was truly a travesty of Justice. Two of her indictments consisted of conspiracy to entice miners to travel and engage in illegal sex acts and also conspiracy to transport minors with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity. Though Maxwell was indicted on two conspiracies none of her criminal cohorts were indicted, which makes absolutely no sense.",

        "full_text": "The takeover of the Kennedy Center may seem like an afterthought in the furious drama of President Donald Trump’s first month in office. The abandonment of the transatlantic alliance, proposals to annex territory on multiple continents, the evisceration of national institutions, and overt claims to kingship are such eye-popping departures from precedent that the leadership of a somewhat stuffy, self-consciously elite performing-arts venue seems negligible by comparison. But Trump’s peculiar preoccupation with the Kennedy Center is symptomatic of a profound change in the nature of American power since his inauguration: America is undergoing a cultural revolution. “This is going to be great television,” Trump said at the end of Friday’s stormy session with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. It may as well be the motto of his administration.\n\nIt is a new kind of cultural revolution. Unlike the totalitarian regimes of the 20th century, which imposed ideology on their populaces by means of culture and entertainment, America’s current reality is the overturning of the political order by the country’s entertainers. The American culture industry has overwhelmed politics: Washington today can be understood only as a product of show business, not of law or policy.\n\nThe Trump administration has been consistent in its veneration of show business, if in nothing else. The president has put a WWE executive in charge of education, made a Fox News talking head his secretary of defense, installed a celebrity conspiracy theorist to lead the National Institutes of Health, handed control of Medicare to a TV doctor, and appointed a right-wing podcaster as deputy director of the FBI. Elon Musk is running government reform because he can live-post it. Dr. Phil accompanies ICE on raids. Trump’s Cabinet picks resemble the cast of a reality-television show by design: Trump understands, by instinct and through experience, that the line between entertainment and power in American life has effectively dissolved.\n\nIn his farewell address, President Joe Biden described the incoming administration as an oligarchy. He was mistaken. It is rule by performers: a “histriocracy.” Anyone who wants to understand what is happening in American politics needs to understand it on those terms.\n\nIn 2016, a reality-TV star’s rise to the presidency was novel, and seeing that surprise triumph as an anomaly was still possible. No longer. The 2024 election was not just evidence of a rightward shift among traditionally Democratic voters, or of rising anti-government patriotism, but a clarification of how fundamentally American politics has shifted the ground from which its meaning derives.\n\nPolitics has become an offshoot of spectacle. Trump has left intellectuals grasping for historical analogies: Is he a fascist or a populist? Is he a latter-day Know Nothing or a modern demagogue? The analogies are unsatisfying because they fail to account for popular culture as a political force, the way it has scrambled traditional dividing lines. Trump has Orthodox Jewish grandchildren and is a hero to the white-power movement. He won a record percentage of Arab American votes, then appointed an ambassador to Israel who claims that “there is no such thing as Palestinians.” He enjoys fervent support among evangelicals despite the fact that his character is a living contradiction of every value they revere. These paradoxes would not be possible in a politics that selects the country’s leadership on the basis of ideas and character. They make sense if brute exposure determines who wins.\n\nAs the grand soap opera of this American presidency unfolds, displays of rage and wonder fill every moment: get-rich-quick schemes, rigged games, vengeful punishments. The audience is hurried from one hustle to another. The distinction between a con and a joke has blurred. The great circus showman P. T. Barnum prophesied the rise of Trump when he declared: “Let me furnish the amusements of a nation and there will be need of very few laws.” The connection between Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and John F. Kennedy is more than genetic. Norman Mailer, in his famous essay on the 1960 Democratic Convention, “Superman Comes to the Supermarket,” noticed a mysterious sadness that gripped the spectators, which made sense only when he saw the future President Kennedy in the flesh: “The Democrats were going to nominate a man who, no matter how serious his political dedication might be, was indisputably and willy-nilly going to be seen as a great box-office actor, and the consequences of that were staggering and not at all easy to calculate.” Trump’s Cabinet is the staggering consequence that Mailer could not calculate.\n\nRonald Reagan in the 1980s made the connection between celebrity and power even more explicit; he rose after a career in which perhaps his most famous role was starring opposite a chimpanzee. The “Great Communicator” told corny jokes and knew that television was everything. The Republican Party “won one for the Gipper,” as Reagan’s campaign slogan had it. When his administration abolished the Fairness Doctrine in 1987, releasing news media from any obligation of impartiality, it prepared the way for histriocracy without government interference.\n\nRule by performers is distinct from autocracy. The ruling performers serve the narrative needs of their fans first and foremost. Policy will always be an addendum to the show. The overturning of Roe v. Wade had compelling emotional heft for Trump’s base, a soul-stirring final scene to the movie that had been playing in their minds for generations: “We beat the cosmopolitan elite to save babies.” The happy ending was that abortion became illegal in much of the United States.\n\nBut winning for show is very different from having a desired effect on the world. Since 2018, the rate of abortions has, by most accounts, kept rising—not that anybody seems to care, because the narrative impulse is the primary political driver. In fact, the restrictionist policy’s failure provides an opportunity for endless sequels. Trump has served the pro-life movement’s storyline needs by creating the conditions for an increase in abortion numbers: so many more bad people to punish, so many more babies who need saving. In a politics determined by performance, outcomes are epilogues that nobody reads.\n\nThe reality of rule by performers is profoundly disconcerting to American intellectuals’ self-conception of their government’s dignity. This is the message of the Kennedy Center’s takeover that the D.C. political elite has been so slow to register. If you think it’s a joke to have RFK Jr. in office, that’s the point. Jokes gather attention. Attention creates exposure. Exposure drives power. The greatest asset for any politician today is a bottomless narcissism that requires unremitting attention to satisfy.\n\nRule by performers doesn’t need to impose an autocrat’s lies on the people; people do it to themselves through their entertainments. In 1984, George Orwell described doublethink as the kind of intellectual gymnastics demanded by a totalitarian society: “To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies.” Reality television and the WWE demand similar distortion-effect gymnastics; their audiences willingly suspend their disbelief and gladly accept events they know are artificial as real. The audiences come to political debate already prepared for the blurring of illusion and reality. “The public appears disposed to be amused even when they are conscious of being deceived,” Barnum understood, which is why they called him the “Prince of Humbugs.” In Trump, they have a king.",

        "full_text": "President Trump announced Monday that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. plans to spend $100 billion on new manufacturing plants in Arizona.\n\nTSMC is the world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer. Companies such as Apple and Intel use its chips in computers, smartphones, cars and medical equipment.\n\n“This will create hundreds of billions of dollars in economic activity and boost America’s dominance in artificial intelligence and beyond,” Mr. Trump said. “Semiconductors are the backbone of the 21st-century economy, and really, without the semiconductors, there is no economy.”\n\nThe money will go toward five facilities in Arizona, which Mr. Trump said will create 20,000 to 25,000 jobs.\n\n“The most powerful AI chips in the world will be made right here in America,” he said.\n\nThe president called the move “a matter of economic security, it’s also a matter of national security.”\n\n“We must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here in American factories with American skill and American labor,” he said. “That’s exactly what we’re doing.”\n\nC.C. Wei, the CEO of TSMC, said he was “happy” to announce the $100 billion investment and thanked Mr. Trump for his support.\n\n“It’s going to create thousands of high-paying jobs,” Mr. Wei said.\n\nTSMC chips manufactured in the U.S. will not be subject to tariffs.\n\nMr. Trump said these and other new factories will increase the U.S. manufacturing share to close to 40% of the chips in the global market.\n\nTSMC benefited from President Biden’s CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which promised $6.6 billion in funding. The company spent more than $65 billion to build three facilities in Arizona, and the first started producing 4-nanometer chips late last year.\n\nMr. Trump has threatened up to 100% tariffs on semiconductor chip imports if production isn’t moved to the U.S.\n\nHe has bashed the CHIPS Act for giving money to a company that already had plenty. He has also raised concerns about Taiwan’s dominance in the industry.\n\n“They left us and went to Taiwan,” Mr. Trump told congressional Republicans in January. “And we don’t want to give them billions of dollars like this ridiculous program that Biden has given everybody billions of dollars. They already have billions of dollars. They’ve got nothing but money. … They didn’t need money. They needed an incentive. And the incentive is going to be they’re not going to want to pay a 25, 50 or even a 100% tax.”\n\nCritics of the Taiwan-based company say it has a monopoly on the worldwide microchip market. More than 90% of the most advanced chips come out of the island, which is the target of constant invasion threats by China.\n\nAnalysts see risks to TSMC operating only out of Taiwan, as it has largely done to date.\n\nAttacks on the island leading to destroyed facilities could leave America shorthanded, putting at risk some of the country’s most important technology and affecting the U.S. military. The company has some facilities in mainland China, which could be susceptible to hacking and sabotage.\n\nLawmakers and other officials have suggested that TSMC’s fabrication plants should be destroyed to prevent them from falling into China’s hands if the communist power follows through with its threat to take over Taiwan, which it views as a renegade province.\n\nThe notion was criticized because the absence of production on Taiwan, regardless of political control, would badly damage economies worldwide.\n\nThe TSMC announcement is just one of several investment announcements Mr. Trump has made since he took office.\n\nThe heads of OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank plan to spend up to $500 billion in artificial intelligence infrastructure. DAMAC Properties said it will spend $20 billion to build data centers.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook has announced plans to invest $500 billion in the U.S. and move manufacturing plants from Mexico to the U.S.\n\nHonda announced Monday that it will produce its next-generation Civic hybrid in the U.S. instead of Mexico to avoid any tariffs.",

        "full_text": "In February 2025, claims (archived) circulated on social media and news outlets including Fox News and Newsweek that 70 Christians were beheaded in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nMedia reports and posts (archived) on X (archived), Facebook and Instagram (archived) said the bodies of the victims were found in a church in Kasanga after the victims were kidnapped from Mayeba, both villages in North Kivu province in the country's northeast.\n\nReports from two religious persecution awareness groups claimed attackers beheaded some or all of the bodies.\n\nSeveral reports accused the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in the Democratic Republic of Congo, also known as the Allied Democratic Forces, of carrying out the attack. The ADF is an armed group designated by the United States as a terrorist organization.\n\nSome Snopes readers asked whether the reported killings happened in Congo without specifying which of the two nations bearing this name — the Republic of Congo, formerly a French territory, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly a Belgian territory — they were referring to. The two are separate countries bordering the Congo River.\n\nThough the story that 70 Christians were beheaded in the DRC was widely reported in local media, it was not possible to independently verify the claims.\n\nLocal media reports featured varying dates for the kidnapping and killing of the alleged victims. Though some stories featured named sources, it was difficult to adequately back up the sources' credentials. Open Doors UK, a charity raising awareness of the prosecution of Christians, told Snopes it was \"100% confident\" that the reported attack occurred. Meanwhile, MONUSCO, the United Nations peacekeeping mission in the DRC, said in a Feb. 24 statement that the reports \"remain unverified.\" The International Committee of the Red Cross in the DRC declined to confirm or deny the claims.\n\nIn a statement, MONUSCO said (emphasis ours):\n\nMONUSCO acknowledges the serious allegations received from a civil society source regarding the reported discovery of over 70 bodies, including those of women, children, and elderly individuals, found on 15 February in a church building in Maiba village, Lubero Territory, North Kivu. According to these initial claims, the victims were allegedly tied up and decapitated, possibly killed with bladed weapons by unidentified armed elements men.\n\nAt this stage, however, it is important to clarify that these reports remain unverified. Our colleagues from the Joint Human Rights Office (JHRO), in coordination with the MONUSCO field office in Beni, are actively investigating the allegations. In line with our established methodology, these claims can only be substantiated once they are corroborated by at least two independent sources.\n\nFor a story to be substantiated it must be corroborated by at least two independent sources, MONUSCO said.\n\nHowever, MONUSCO did confirm that \"at least 40 civilians\" were abducted by \"elements of the Allied Democratic Forces\" from Mayeba, the same village named in the beheading reports, on Feb. 10.\n\nLocal media reports used hard-to-verify sources\n\nLocal media sources widely reported the story, including Radio Okapi, a MONUSCO-supported outlet, that reported that the 70 bodies were discovered on Feb. 15. However, a report from news site 7sur7 citing a phone interview with Vianney Vitswamba, the head of the local \"community protection committee,\" said the bodies were discovered on Feb. 14.\n\nAnother news site, Actualite.cd, reported the alleged victims were abducted on Feb. 11-12, also citing Vitswamba. Afrik.com, a news site reporting on African affairs in French, cited Vitswamba for the Feb. 11-12 abductions but reported, without an attribution, that the bodies were discovered on Feb. 14.\n\nA Google search for Vitswamba's name from Jan. 1, 2000, until Feb. 10, 2025, brought up two articles from 7sur7 about another alleged ADF attack in Lubero in January 2025. This is the same territory as the reported February 2025 attack. The 7sur7 articles also cited Vitswamba. There were no results for Vitswamba's name in news reporting prior to 2025, and it was not possible to find credible contact details for him.\n\nAnonymous sources formed backbone of charity reports\n\nSeveral religious charities also reported on the incident. Open Doors UK, a charity raising awareness of the persecution of Christians worldwide, cited Muhindo Musunzi, the director of a local primary school, who said the \"chaotic security situation\" in the area had caused schools and other public institutions to cease operations. A Google search of Musunzi's name did not bring up credible results prior to the February 2025 story.\n\nBen Cohen, spokesman for Open Doors UK, told Snopes via email that the organization was \"100% confident\" that the incident occurred. According to Cohen, the group's Africa team spoke to Musunzi about the attack and contacted local church leaders as well.\n\n\"We are gathering more information all the time and expect to have a list of the names of those killed. However we have cross checked and can confirm they were all members of local churches. It is a largely Christian area,\" Cohen said.\n\nBoth Open Doors UK and Aid to the Church in Need, a Catholic organization supporting persecuted Christians, cited unnamed sources in their reports.\n\nAid to the Church in Need cited an anonymous source who said the 70 bodies were discovered on Feb. 15. The source was unnamed for their safety, ACN said. Snopes does not rely on anonymous sources to confirm claims. We have reached out them for more information and await their reply.\n\nThere were no reports at the time of this writing that ISIS or the ADF had claimed responsibility for the attack.",

Kim Reynolds, trans people in Iowa will no longer be considered a protected category under state law.\n\nThe bill’s supporters were clear: They want to be able to discriminate against trans people — and don’t want any barriers like pesky civil rights protections in the way.\n\n“If signed, Iowa will become the first state in American history to remove a protected class from its Civil Rights Act,” wrote Erin Reed, a journalist and trans rights advocate, “setting a dangerous precedent for broader rollbacks of anti-discrimination protections.”\n\nIntroduced last week, the new legislation was pushed through at breakneck speed. The Republican-led Iowa Legislature voted 60 to 36 in the House and 33 to 15 in the Senate to pass the bill, which now heads to Reynolds’s desk for signing. Reynolds has been a keen participant in the Republicans’ anti-trans onslaught so is unlikely to push back.\n\nIowa included gender identity in its civil rights code since 2007 with the aim of protecting against employment, housing, health care, education, and other widespread discrimination that trans people face.\n\nA 2024 study from the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law found that 82 percent of trans people reported experiencing discrimination or harassment at work due to their gender identity or sexual orientation — nearly double the number of cis LGBTQ+ individuals who reported experiencing discrimination. One in 5 trans people have experienced homelessness at some point in their lives.\n\nThe move to revoke civil rights — and remove “gender identity” as a protected category — is directly at odds with the Supreme Court’s 2020 decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, which held that the 1964 Civil Rights Act protects employees against discrimination based on sex and gender identity. In line with the Trump administration’s anti-scientific enforcement of two strictly binary sexes, the Iowa bill defines sex as assigned by anatomy at birth.\n\nThe Republicans behind the law were unambiguous that civil rights protections were a barrier to enforcing other anti-trans laws on their traditionalist, pro-natalist agenda. It is harder to ban people from bathrooms, from educational spaces, from the public and professional sphere, when those people are understood to have rights.\n\n“All of these common-sense policies are at risk so long as gender identity remains in the Iowa civil rights code,” state Rep. Steven Holt, a Republican supporter of the bill, said on the House floor.\n\nHolt was, of course, referring to the sort of policies that have led to the harassment of both trans and cis people in women’s bathrooms. Such measures have opened the door to proposed genital inspections for children who want to play sports, not to mention the denial of potential lifesaving health care — all in the name of a “common-sense” gender fascism that, for all its alleged naturalness, takes an extraordinary amount of effort and violence to enforce.\n\nIt should not need repeating that trans women have never been found to pose a higher risk of perpetrating an assault in a women’s bathroom than cis women; there is no correlation between trans-inclusive policies and a rise in safety risks. Rather it is trans people, particularly trans people of color, who are at significantly elevated risks of violence, including deadly violence.\n\nI only restate this here because much mainstream coverage of anti-trans attacks like the Iowa legislation — including in the New York Times — depicts these discriminatory assaults as if they represent a debate with two reasonable opposing sides, without clarifying the truth: Republican claims to women’s safety concerns are based on a phantasma of threat, and part of a broader drive to erase bodily autonomy.",

        "full_text": "The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) upcoming Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee meeting on March 13 was abruptly canceled via email on Wednesday. The committee was to consider the selection of strains to be included in the influenza virus vaccines for the 2025–2026 flu season. This is the second vaccine-related advisory meeting canceled since Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. took over at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\nNo reason for the cancellation was given, and the committee members were warned against forwarding the email. It suggested that members decline to answer questions from media.\n\nSo much for Kennedy's pledge earlier this month of \"radical transparency.\" He added, \"We will make our data and our policy process so transparent that people won't even have to file a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request.\"\n\nIn addition to suggesting members of the FDA's vaccine committee stifle themselves, the HHS will publish a notice next week in the Federal Register to eliminate public comment on that agency's plans and decisions. While past meetings have been open to public scrutiny and participation, it is not clear if the new limits will apply to future meetings of the committee. Radical transparency, indeed.\n\nWith respect to the normal processes for evaluating and developing annual flu vaccines, the FDA has previously explained:\n\nThe job of producing a new vaccine for the next flu season starts well before the current season ends. For the FDA, it's a year-round initiative.\n\nFlu viruses are constantly evolving. The flu viruses that circulate and cause disease in people often change from one year to another, necessitating a new vaccine every year.\n\nTo accomplish this, the FDA, World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other partners collaborate by collecting and reviewing data on the circulating flu strains from around the world to identify those likely to cause the most illness in the upcoming season.\n\nIn late February/early March — well before the new influenza season begins, the FDA convenes its vaccines advisory committee to review data about which flu viruses have caused disease in the past year, how the viruses are changing, and disease trends so they can recommend the flu virus strains to include in the vaccines for the upcoming U.S. flu season.\n\nOnce the strains are selected, vaccine manufacturers begin the manufacturing process to include the newly selected flu strains in their FDA-approved vaccines. The different virus strains are combined to formulate the vaccine into standard dosages. The vaccine is then filled into vials, syringes and, for the nasal vaccine, sprayers.\n\nFlu vaccine effectiveness varies from year to year depending, among other things, on whether the FDA guessed right about which strains will be circulating each season. The current vaccine is around 40 percent to 60 percent effective against influenza-associated hospitalization.\n\nNoting that the U.S. is currently experiencing one of the worst flu seasons in a decade, Infectious Diseases Society of America president Tina Tan warns that \"cancelling a critically important Food and Drug Administration meeting that is vital to the development of effective flu vaccines for next flu season is irresponsible.\" She adds, \"Cancelling this meeting means vaccine makers may not have the vital information and time they need to produce and distribute targeted vaccines before the next flu season. If the FDA meeting is not immediately rescheduled, many lives that could be saved by vaccination will be lost.\"\n\nRFK, Jr.'s HHS promises that the FDA \"will make public its recommendations to manufacturers in time for updated vaccines to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season.\"\n\nWe'll see.",

Police detained the driver, who appeared to have ploughed intentionally into the crowd given the speed at which he was driving, prosecutors said in an act Interior Minister Nancy Faeser labeled \"horror in broad daylight\". He did not appear to have been politically or religiously motivated, but there were reasons to believe he was psychologically unwell, said Mannheim Chief Public Prosecutor Romeo Schluessler. Prosecutors have initiated investigative proceedings against the suspect, a 40-year-old German man from the neighbouring state of Rhineland-Palatinate, on two counts of murder and multiple counts of attempted murder. The suspect has not been questioned yet as he had to undergo medical treatment after shooting himself in the mouth with a blank-firing gun after the attack. He appeared to be a landscape gardener who lived alone, prosecutors said, adding that they were now investigating his home for clues. Security has been a key concern in Germany following a string of violent attacks in recent weeks, including deadly car rammings in Magdeburg in December and in Munich last month, as well as a stabbing in Mannheim in May 2024. \"The incident — like the terrible acts of the past months — serves as a stark reminder: we must do everything possible to prevent such acts,\" said Germany's likely next leader, Friedrich Merz, whose conservatives won a national election last month. \"Germany must once again become a safe country. We will work with full determination to achieve this.\" Police officers work at the site where a car drove into a crowd, in Mannheim, Germany, March 3, 2025.

REUTERS/Heiko Becker , Messages of solidarity were sent from across Europe. \"To all the people of Mannheim, especially to all the relatives of the victims of the attack, to the German people. France is at your side,\" French President Emmanuel Macron wrote on the social media platform X. Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said \"attempts to destabilize democratic nations will not prevail\". The two who died were an 83-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man. NERVOUS CARNIVAL Police were on high alert for this year's carnival parades after social media accounts linked to the Islamic State militant group called for attacks on the events in Cologne and Nuremberg. There did not appear to be a connection between Monday's incident and the carnival celebrations, the interior minister of the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Thomas Strobl, told reporters. Those festivities culminated on Rose Monday with a number of parades, although not in Mannheim, which held its main event on Sunday. Rose Monday, the culmination of the annual carnival season celebrated in Germany's mainly Catholic western and southern regions, features parades of floats that often include comical or satirical references to current affairs. This year's carnival has included floats featuring U.S. President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin, tech billionaire Elon Musk and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Dressed in traditional jester costumes and sporting colourful makeup, thousands of partygoers danced through the streets of Cologne, Dusseldorf and other cities in western and southern Germany ahead of the fasting season of Lent.

Speaker of the House Mike Johnson speaks during a House Republican members conference meeting in Trump National Doral resort, in Miami, Florida, U.S. January 27, 2025. , Summary Republicans, Democrats at odds over Trump spending cuts Both sides say they want to keep government funded until October WASHINGTON, March 3 (Reuters) - With less than two weeks to go before a March 14 deadline, Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. Congress appear to be nowhere close to a deal to avert a government shutdown that would throw Washington into deeper turmoil. The talks have been complicated by President Donald Trump , who has ignored spending laws passed by Congress, suspended foreign aid and fired tens of thousands of federal workers. Both sides say his actions are the biggest sticking point as they seek to reach a deal that would provide government funding beyond March 14, when it is due to expire. Democrats say they are trying to secure guarantees that would prevent Trump and his budget-slashing point person, billionaire Elon Musk , from firing more workers or cancelling more government programs. \"We will continue to make clear that the law has to be followed,\" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters late last week. Republicans say Democrats are trying to undo Trump's actions, which they call a nonstarter. \"The bigger issue is the Democrats' insistence on putting poison pills into the bill that would restrict the president’s abilities,\" Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine told reporters last week. Collins said she is \"very close\" to an agreement with Democrats that would fund the government at current levels through September 30, the end of the fiscal year. Trump has said on social media that he supports that approach. Democratic Senator Patty Murray of Washington said that would give Trump more power to shift funding as he pleases and would create shortfalls for some safety net programs. Both she and Collins have said a flat-line extension would also pose problems for the U.S. military at a time when the United States is confronting challenges from Russia, China and other parts of the world. The spending deal only covers a portion of the budget, funding agencies like the Department of Defense and the Environmental Protection Agency. It would not address the country's rising borrowing costs or rapidly growing benefit programs like Social Security and Medicare. Republicans are separately pushing to extend the tax cuts that Trump signed into law in 2017. One version, which narrowly passed the House last week, would cut taxes by $4.5 trillion and reduce spending by $2 trillion over a decade. Independent analysts say that would further add to the nation's $36 trillion debt load. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson said in a Sunday interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that he was aiming to pass a stopgap funding bill. \"We are working hard to do our responsibility to keep the government open,\" said Johnson, of Louisiana. \"We need our Democrat colleagues to come to the table and be reasonable about that.\" Johnson leads a slim 218-215 majority and last year had to repeatedly turn to Democrats to pass legislation through his chamber, where a simple majority suffices. Democratic votes are needed to pass most bills in the Senate, where Republicans currently hold a 53-47 majority, short of the 60-vote threshold for most legislation. Trump's administration has made clear that its budget cutting efforts will continue. Officials last week ordered federal agencies to lay the groundwork for further layoffs, beyond the 100,000 who have already been fired or offered a buyout. The government employed 2.3 million civilian workers last year. Failure to reach a spending deal by March 14 would force the government to furlough hundreds of thousands of workers and shutter \"nonessential\" operations , such as financial regulation and trash pickup at national parks. The last government shutdown was also the longest, ending in January 2019 after 35 days, as Trump during his first term in office and lawmakers clashed over his effort to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. With no clear resolution in sight, lawmakers have already begun pointing fingers. \"Republicans have a responsibility to fund the government,\" Jeffries said last week, pointing out that Republicans control both chambers of Congress and the White House. Representative John Rutherford, a Florida Republican, said if Democrats vote against the \"clean\" extension of spending through September, \"they're the ones voting for the shutdown, not us.\" Reporting by Richard Cowan and David Morgan, additional reporting by Katharine Jackson; editing by Andy Sullivan and Chizu Nomiyama . , United States category Combative Trump declares 'America is back'.

        "full_text": "If you think your energy bill is already high, brace yourself. Labour may have promised a Net Zero electricity system that would cut average bills by £300 — but as new research reveals, the opposite is going to happen. We can expect the cost of electricity to increase by at least 75%.\n\n“I have absolute faith,” energy secretary Ed Miliband has said, that Net Zero will “do great things for our country and our world.” Inconveniently, an investigation by one of Britain’s leading energy experts provides evidence that our growing reliance on Miliband’s beloved renewable forms of energy, not the “rollercoaster” fossil fuels market, is more likely to have a devastating economic effect.\n\nFor the past two months, Professor Gordon Hughes, a senior fellow at Washington’s National Centre for Energy Analytics and Edinburgh University’s former head of economics, has been working with UnHerd to develop a sophisticated computer model of the UK’s electricity system which provides a robust picture of power generation and why the economic pain is only set to continue.\n\nMiliband, according to Hughes, is starting from a false premise. He is “unambiguously wrong” to claim that the principal cause of rising bills to date has been the price of natural gas. In fact, the wholesale price of electricity, which is where changes in fossil fuel prices are most clearly seen, has generally been constant for the past 20 years. And yet in that same period, electricity bills paid by businesses have almost quadrupled, while those of domestic households have more or less trebled.\n\nIt’s true that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 saw the European natural gas price surge briefly by up to 500%, while there was a smaller, short-lived spike in 2008, caused by an imbalance between supply and demand. But to blame, as Miliband does,“petrostates and dictators” for the fluctuations is, according to Hughes, just a “convenient scapegoat”. In fact, it’s the ever-growing thicket of taxes, levies and subsidies, stemming from the switch to renewables, which has caused the price increase, for these added extras now comprise more than three-quarters of the cost of electricity on household bills. According to Hughes, “the steady increase in inflation-adjusted electricity prices over the last two decades is largely a matter of self-inflicted harm”.\n\nAnd his model reveals that under the Government’s 2030 clean power plan, much worse is yet to come.\n\nFor true believers like Miliband, this would be a price worth paying if Britain really could become a net-zero paradise. But unfortunately, given the basic inefficiency of renewables, and the fact they often don’t generate power for hours or days at a time, fossil fuels are destined to remain part of our energy mix for many years. This means that if we want to keep the lights on, we are going to have to spend billions of pounds well before 2030 to build new, back-up gas-fired power plants that Miliband claims will only be used 5% of the time, simply because so many in our existing fleet are worn out.\n\nThe single biggest element in the coming increase projected by the model is the cost of the planned expansion in renewables. Official estimates of its cost, says Hughes, are too low, and judging by recent market data, the price for constructing new wind and solar farms is likely to be around £150 billion over the next five years — all of which will be added to bills.\n\nAnother factor is Britain’s increasing dependence on electricity supplied via undersea cables from abroad. According to the Hughes model, the more electricity we import, the more we pay. But without it, there will be blackouts. In 2024, after all, Britain was a net electricity importer 91% of the time. Yet foreign energy cannot be relied on. Norway has already passed a law allowing its government to block the sale of electricity when its own supply is scarce. Other countries may well follow suit.\n\nYou might argue that high prices from European supplies are, in turn, caused by spikes in the natural gas market. But that, Hughes’s model shows, would once again be false: gas accounts for less than 15% of Germany’s energy mix, and less than 5% of France’s. And while Miliband claims his Net Zero plans are needed because gas prices are always bound to rise, that’s also untrue. In Europe, the long-term trend has been stable for 25 years, while in America, the fracking boom has seen costs fall. In other words, to insure against another 2022 — an unusually bad year — Miliband wants to transform British energy in ways that Hughes’s model shows will incur much long-term hardship. That, he notes, “seems like rather a bad bargain”.\n\n“While Miliband claims his Net Zero plans are needed because gas prices are always bound to rise, that’s untrue.”\n\nWorse is to come, especially once Labour’s green revolution really kicks in. It’s certainly true that wind and solar farms can generate energy from nature, saving operators on fuel costs. But the “full system costs” of renewables wipe out these gains. If, for example, the wind doesn’t blow, turbines will need backup generators. And though Miliband says he wants an eightfold increase in large-scale batteries to store electricity when the weather doesn’t cooperate, the technology only functions for around two hours. This winter, we’ve had days on end without wind, and Hughes’s model suggests batteries would make up just 10-15% of the shortfall.\n\nHow, then, would Britain secure the rest of the energy it needs? With natural gas! While Miliband claims gas-powered plants will only need to operate 5% of the time by 2030, Hughes suggests the real figure will be at least three times as high — bearing in mind that the Government says growth in electric vehicles, heat pumps and immigration will increase demand for electricity by 11%. To create a reserve big enough to cope when renewables aren’t functioning and parts of the system “trip off” because of a fault, Hughes says that by 2030, Britain will need some 50 gigawatts (GW) of gas or diesel generating capacity, up from 30 GW now, partly because nuclear stations are due to shut, and we cannot rely on electricity always being available from abroad.\n\nOf course, existing gas plants could remain operational, but only run when needed. But this would ignore another problem. The “open cycle” variety of gas-powered turbines that can be fired up quickly, making them suitable for occasional use, have a lifespan of around 30 years — and almost all in Britain have already reached this limit. By 2030, two-thirds of the less adaptable “closed cycle” type will be similarly aged. Even if we make generous assumptions about how many old facilities might still be available, this means building a whole new fleet over just five years, even though these plants would often lie idle.\n\nAll this will obviously cost billions. Current turbine prices come in at some £60 million per GW, so building new back-up plants with a total capacity of 30 GW would cost £18 billion, and 50 GW £30 billion. This implies a further question. With the economy in the doldrums, and the Treasury under pressure to fund budget increases in health and defence, how exactly would Miliband pay for his net-zero dreams? Here, again, the answer is levies on bills, the fees that have already raided pockets so dramatically. Contracts for backup power plants are issued by the Government through what it calls the “capacity market”. This is already skyrocketing, from £120 million in 2017 to £1.1 billion in 2024. With renewables continuing to crowd out reliable alternatives, the capacity market is increasingly needed. And Hughes’s model says these levies are likely to reach an eyewatering £7.4 billion by 2030 — a conservative estimate.\n\nThe model identifies still further costs. One is the permits operators must buy to burn gas and other fossil fuels, and whose prices are constantly rising. Then there’s the so-called “balancing mechanism” — whereby operators are paid to generate energy in an emergency, or else cut off production entirely in the case of grid bottlenecks. Taking in all these factors, Hughes’s model suggests the cost of electricity production could reach almost £60 billion by 2030, between 70 and 80% higher than it would be if the UK stuck with its current, non-Net Zero system.\n\nNor is this even the whole story. All told, electricity generation only accounts for about half your bill. Most of the rest is formed of “network charges” — paid to the National Grid and energy firms for ensuring the power gets from producers to end users. The exact numbers are more difficult to calculate. But the National Electricity System Operator (NESO), the Government-owned company that runs the grid, has said that to create a Net Zero system, it will need to vastly expand its network to link up new wind and solar farms. The upshot? A potential outlay of £65 billion by 2030, with network charges rising from between 80 and 117%.\n\nThe economic impact of all this, it hardly needs stating, would be disastrous. “It is a tax on all of us,” is how Hughes puts it. “Electricity-intensive industries which compete in world markets can only meet it by reducing wages or profits. Since workers are unwilling to accept reductions in their incomes, the result has been that they have closed their activities in the UK and moved elsewhere.” The evidence is already in, with the recent demise of the Bridgend steelworks, the pending closure of the Grangemouth refinery and the likely end of car manufacturing at the BMW factory in Oxford. Vauxhall, Hotpoint, JCB and niche manufacturers of items such as mattresses are also cutting jobs and have warned they may soon leave Britain too.\n\nNot that Ed Miliband seems to mind. Only last week, he reiterated his commitment to Labour’s net-zero targets, stating that “the single most important thing we can do is stick to our clean power mission”. It seems that to a man seeking to build a world-leading utopia, something as transient as Britain’s future prosperity doesn’t mean very much.\n\n***",

        "full_text": "There is the theory that President Trump is still bitter about his Canadian hotel ventures that went bust.\n\nSome, on social media, have speculated that a 2019 photograph in which Justin Trudeau appeared poised to kiss Melania Trump, the first lady, at a Group of 7 gathering in France, left Mr. Trump with a grudge against the dashing Canadian prime minister.\n\nAnd then there is the transactional view, that Mr. Trump sees the acquisition of Canada as the 51st state as the ultimate real estate deal that would seal his presidential legacy.\n\nAs Mr. Trump prepares to push ahead with a new round of tariffs on the United States’ neighbors to the north and south, he has expressed a special brand of loathing for Canada. The bullying of a country whose most prominent stereotype is that its people are “nice” has led to political upheaval in Canada and created both consternation and speculation about why Mr. Trump wants to engage in a trade war with one of America’s biggest trading partners.\n\n“I can’t quite figure it out,” said Stephen Moore, the Heritage Foundation economist and former adviser to Mr. Trump. “Whether it’s some kind of strategic leverage, I don’t know.”\n\nNoting that there is “no love lost” between the president and Mr. Trudeau, Mr. Moore added: “With Trump, politics is personal.”\n\nMr. Trump has threatened to hit Mexico and Canada with 25 percent tariffs on all imports on Tuesday unless the countries do more to prevent migrants and drugs from flowing into the United States. On Saturday, the president picked another trade fight with Canada, this time over lumber.\n\nIntrigue abounds in Canada about why Mr. Trump has repeatedly belittled a neighbor and threatened to destabilize its economy with tariffs, a process that has brought relations between the two countries to a low point not seen in decades.\n\nIn contrast to the close and supportive relationship that Mr. Trudeau, who is entering his final week in office, enjoyed with another U.S. president, Barack Obama, his relationship with Mr. Trump has been fractious.\n\nWhile Mr. Trudeau was generally circumspect in his public remarks about Mr. Trump during the president’s first administration, the two men have dramatically different personal and political styles. Mr. Trump bombastically denigrates people he perceives as opponents, whereas Mr. Trudeau often speaks about the value of bringing people together, what he once called a “sunny ways” approach to political life.\n\nIn candid remarks to a group of business leaders last month that was captured by a microphone, Mr. Trudeau offered a theory for Mr. Trump’s Canada obsession that is widely shared in the country.\n\n“Not only does the Trump administration know how many critical minerals we have, but that may be even why they keep talking about absorbing us and making us the 51st state,” Mr. Trudeau told the gathering in Toronto.\n\n“They’re very aware of our resources,” Mr. Trudeau said, “of what we have, and they very much want to be able to benefit from those.”\n\nHe added: “But Mr. Trump has it in mind that one of the easiest ways of doing that is absorbing our country. And it is a real thing.”\n\nMr. Trump does have a particular affinity for minerals. He has been pushing to broker a deal to secure access to Ukraine’s supply of rare earths as he seeks to broker an agreement to end its war with Russia.\n\nAs a businessman, Mr. Trump had two dealings with Canada that, while relatively limited, were both failures. The Toronto hotel and condominium project, owned by a Toronto investor who licensed the Trump name and hired a Trump company to manage it, went into receivership in 2016. The following year, a hotel owned by Malaysian investors bearing the Trump name, again under license and with a similar management contract, opened in Vancouver, British Columbia. (Promotional material exaggerated the building’s height.) It failed, as well.\n\n“Trump’s name and brand have no more place on Vancouver’s skyline than his ignorant ideas have in the modern world,” Mr. Robertson wrote.\n\nBefore delving into politics, Mr. Trump expressed little ill will toward Canada.\n\nIn 2012, when the Obama administration was delaying a decision on approving the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would have transported oil from Canada to the United States, Mr. Trump declared on social media that the project must move forward.\n\n“We need to use our resources and support allies like Canada,” Mr. Trump said.\n\nBut by 2015, his perceived failings of the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico became a central issue of Mr. Trump’s first presidential campaign. Mr. Trump routinely called the deal a “disaster” for American workers, and prioritized scrapping the pact as a first order of business if he won the election.\n\nAn agreement to overhaul the trade deal was signed in 2020 after fraught negotiations between the three countries that often grew contentious. At one point, Mr. Trump suggested leaving Canada on the sidelines and proceeding with a deal between the United States and Mexico.\n\nNow back in office, Mr. Trump has made clear that the agreement he signed did not do enough for the United States and must be rewritten. In recent days he has lashed out at Chrystia Freeland, the Canadian official who negotiated it on behalf of Canada.\n\n“She’s a whack,” Mr. Trump said of Ms. Freeland, who was Canada’s deputy prime minister and finance minister during the president’s first term, in an interview with The Spectator.\n\nAs Mr. Trump has wielded the threat of new tariffs on Canada over the last month, his tone toward the departing prime minister has been even more derisive. He has nicknamed Mr. Trudeau “governor” amid persistent suggestions that the United States might annex Canada.\n\nMr. Trump even called for the former Canadian hockey player Wayne Gretzky to run for prime minister, suggesting late last year that he would “win easily.” Mr. Gretzky, who does not support Canada’s joining the United States, has faced backlash at home from citizens who view him as a traitor because of his association with Mr. Trump.\n\nThe insults have led to a boom in nationalism in Canada, including “Made in Canada” Facebook groups. In one group, which has more than a million members, Canadians compared notes on pancake mixes that are made in Canada and offered recommendations on flavors of Cove Soda, a potential alternative to Coca-Cola.",

        "full_text": "Ukraine is ready to sign the minerals deal with Washington, despite the heated argument between him and his US counterpart on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters late Sunday.\n\nMere days after leaving the White House without signing the deal with US President Donald Trump, Zelenskyy said, \"I just want the Ukrainian position to be heard. We want our partners to remember who the aggressor is in this war.\"\n\nThe meeting turned into a terse exchange of words live on TV, with Trump concluding the raw minerals deal — which brought Zelenskyy to the White House to begin with — was off.\n\n\"I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations,\" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform Friday.\n\n\"I don’t want advantage, I want peace. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for peace,\" he announced.\n\nUS access to Ukraine's rare earth minerals was first presented to Zelenskyy by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent earlier in February.\n\nWashington is asking for a 50% cut of all revenues generated from Ukraine's mineral and natural resources in what US officials have said is payment for previous military support.\n\nAccording to the deal, Ukraine will contribute the proceeds to a fund, which will then be invested to \"promote the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine.\"\n\nZelenskyy has said that the deal must include real security guarantees for Ukraine and warned against further Russian aggression if these were not put into place.\n\nHis comments about the deal came at the end of a two-day summit in the United Kingdom, where UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the UK and France would gather a \"coalition of the willing\" that would draw up a peace plan for Ukraine.\n\n“We are at a crossroads in history today,” Starmer said.\n\n“This is not a moment for more talk. It’s time to act. Time to step up and lead and to unite around a new plan for a just and enduring peace.”\n\nPrior to this, Bessent told CBS News that the Ukrainian leader had \"thrown off the sequencing\" of how the minerals and peace deal were supposed to play out, insisting the discussions should have taken place in private.\n\nIt was \"impossible to have an economic deal without a peace deal,\" Bessent said.",

        "full_text": "When President Trump threatened tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China in January, saying those countries needed to do more to stop the flow of drugs and migrants into the United States, Canadian and Mexican officials raced to Washington, bearing charts and videos detailing their efforts to toughen their borders.\n\nCanada created a “fentanyl czar” and committed fresh resources to combating organized crime, while Mexico dispatched troops to the border and delivered cartel operatives into U.S. custody. As a result, Mr. Trump paused tariffs on America’s North American neighbors for 30 days.\n\nChina never made these kinds of overtures and, in Mr. Trump’s view, did not take any big moves to stop the flow of fentanyl into the United States. So on Feb. 4, Mr. Trump moved forward with imposing a 10 percent tariff on all Chinese imports. Last week, the president said that on March 4 he would add another 10 percent on top of all existing Chinese tariffs.\n\nMr. Trump is moving quickly to transform the U.S.-China trade relationship. The Chinese are moving much more cautiously and deliberately as they try to assess Mr. Trump and determine what it is he actually wants from China. Some of Mr. Trump’s advisers, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have held calls with their Chinese counterparts. But a call between Mr. Trump and Xi Jinping, China’s leader, has failed to materialize.\n\nThe situation underscores the quandary for foreign leaders in dealing with a president as unpredictable and unconventional as Mr. Trump, who is making substantial changes to trade terms with little advance notice or preparation.\n\nThe Chinese do not want to initiate a conversation because they do not want to be seen as pleading, and are wary of offering concessions before they understand the parameters of the debate, people familiar with the discussions said. Instead, Chinese officials, academics and others close to the government have been holding discreet conversations to try to determine Mr. Trump’s motives, while floating various aspects of a potential trade deal between the countries to assess the Americans’ reaction.\n\n“With my experience with the Chinese, they are suspicious in the initial rounds of a negotiation that there are hidden traps or other reasons to be cautious,” said Michael Pillsbury, a China expert who advises the Trump administration on dealing with the country.\n\nThe Chinese side has conveyed they would like to work with the United States on mutually beneficial measures. But they have been struggling to identify people in the United States that they see as reliable channels for communication, according to a person close to the Chinese government.\n\nThey are also trying to assess the significance of some recent steps by the administration, like a memorandum that proposed strict limits on investment between the countries. Mr. Trump publicly contradicted that memo days after he signed it, saying he welcomed Chinese investment.\n\n“I think the Chinese are in a wait and listen mode,” said Myron Brilliant, who has spent years working with businesses to understand the Chinese and recently returned from a trip to China. “They’re taking in all kinds of input, they’re beginning their consultations, they’re not pushing the panic button just yet.”\n\n“There is a willingness, an appetite to do a deal with the Trump administration, but China doesn’t want preconditions on that, and seeks more clarity on the parameters of a deal,” said Mr. Brilliant, a senior counselor at DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group, an advisory firm.\n\nThey called for treating China as an equal partner and criticized past measures taken by the Biden administration to “contain” China, like export controls. The delegation also threatened that, if further U.S. tariffs went into effect, China could withdraw a law enforcement package that it had put together to combat the fentanyl trade, which included information that could be used to prosecute Chinese companies, one of the people said. They acknowledged that the Chinese economy was struggling and that more tariffs could hurt it.\n\nCurrent and former advisers and others familiar with Mr. Trump’s thinking say he has expressed interest in striking a wide-ranging deal with Mr. Xi, which could involve Chinese purchases and investment, as well as cooperation on issues like nuclear security.\n\nBut Mr. Trump also believes that China reneged on the deal he signed with it in 2020 by not purchasing enough products. Mr. Trump also has no aversion to ramping up the pressure on Beijing by imposing tariffs, seeing them as a source of leverage in negotiations.\n\nMr. Trump has said he has a great relationship with Mr. Xi and would like the Chinese to invest in the United States. When asked in February if he would do a trade deal with China, Mr. Trump responded, “It’s possible.”\n\nIn an interview on Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures, Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, said that instead of stopping the manufacturing of fentanyl, the Chinese were giving “the maximum subsidy” to people making the ingredients.\n\n“The Chinese need to stop this murder of Americans,” he said.\n\nThe tariffs that Mr. Trump has threatened to impose on China since coming into office are already roughly comparable to those he imposed during his first administration, said Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. In 2018, Mr. Trump put tariffs ranging from 7.5 to 25 percent on more than $350 billion of Chinese imports, levies that remain in effect.\n\n“It’s still early days,” Mr. Kennedy said. “This should be seen as the floor of what’s imposed, not the ceiling.”\n\nBeijing has so far been cautious in retaliating, answering Mr. Trump’s first volley of tariffs with a more limited number of its own. But it has signaled that it is willing to go further, possibly using its dominance in the global supply chain to exact pain.\n\nThe Chinese delegation that included Mr. Cui had come to New York as China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, visited the United Nations. While Mr. Wang did not continue on to Washington, according to one source, the Chinese embassy helped to arrange meetings for Mr. Cui in the nation’s capital.\n\nSenior Communist Party officials including Fang Xinghai, the former deputy chief of China’s markets regulator, and the economist Zhu Min, also traveled to Washington and met with some members of the think tank community and government.\n\nThe Chinese appear to be exploring the best points of contact for their government. In the previous Trump administration, the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, served as an important go-between, as did private sector figures. Recently, the Chinese have been probing the role that Elon Musk — who has extensive business interests in China through Tesla — will play in the Trump administration.\n\nPrivately, the Chinese have indicated a willingness to start negotiating a deal but want to know that they have direct access to Mr. Trump.\n\n“There seems to be a sense that Beijing is blaming what has happened on the poor communication channels,” said Yun Sun, the director of the China program at the Stimson Center, a research group in Washington.",

        "full_text": "watch now\n\nLONDON — The European Union is expected to announce \"concrete\" measures on boosting defense financing this week, sources told CNBC, as Europe and the United States clash over support for Ukraine.\n\nThe 27 EU leaders will gather in Brussels on Thursday for a meeting dedicated to defense and support for Ukraine. It follows two particularly tense moments in U.S.-Europe relations: Vice President JD Vance's speech in Munich in mid-February when he criticized European leaders; and the on-the-record clash between the U.S. administration and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on Friday.\n\nEuropean leaders are trying not to alienate President Donald Trump after he criticized Zelenskyy for \"gambling\" over a potential World War III. At the same time, Europeans know they have to take immediate action to ensure that Ukraine continues to receive the support it needs — and any further aggression from Russian President Vladimir Putin is prevented.\n\n\"There will be intense work in the coming days,\" an EU official, who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the discussions but is part of the preparations for Thursday's meeting, told CNBC Monday.\n\nThe same official said the aim is to announce \"concrete deliverables\" on the financing of defense.\n\nTraders will be watching the talks between EU officials closely. The European Stoxx Aerospace and Defense index has risen almost 23% in the year to date as investors bet on spending hikes, and was over 6% higher in Monday morning trade.\n\nwatch now\n\nTrump has often criticized European nations for failing to spend 2% of their GDP on defense, as stipulated by NATO rules. Since Trump's first term, several countries have increased their defense spending and the latest NATO figures indicate that 23 of the 32 members are expected to have achieved the 2% target in 2024.\n\nNow, many NATO members are looking to increase spending even more, with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte telling CNBC in February that the figure will have to be \"much more than than 2%.\" Trump, meanwhile, has called for 5% of GDP as the NATO contribution target.\n\nHow to spend more on defense\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced in February that EU fiscal rules will be updated to allow countries to spend more on defense without being constrained by specific debt and deficit targets.\n\nThe unnamed EU official told CNBC that the next announcement will go even further. \"We are looking at additional funding for defense at the EU level, including through flexibility in the use of structural funds and adaptation of the EIB mandate,\" the official said.\n\nThe European Investment Bank, which is targeting 95 billion euros ($99.26 billion) in investments in 2025, is currently constrained to only financing dual-use defense projects, which means they have to have both civil and military purposes.\n\nA second EU official, who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the talks, confirmed to CNBC Monday that Von der Leyen is expected to present \"concrete measures\" in terms of defense financing in the coming days. These will then be discussed by EU leaders on Thursday.\n\nRoman Pilipey | Afp | Getty Images\n\n\"We urgently have to rearm Europe. And for that I will present a comprehensive plan to the leaders on how to rearm Europe on 6 March when we have our European Council,\" von der Leyen said at a summit in London on Sunday.\n\nIn a recent report called \"Defending Europe without the U.S.,\" Brussels-based think tank Bruegel calculated that Europe could need \"300,000 more troops and an annual defence spending hike of at least 250 billion euros in the short term to deter Russian aggression.\"\n\nGoldman Sachs, meanwhile, said in a note Sunday that \"in the absence of offsetting fiscal measures, the Euro area needs to fund an additional 0.6% of GDP annually to meet the defence spending target at 2.5%.\"\n\nOne key question is whether the EU will go so far as to agree to common borrowing for defense projects. The bloc decided to take that unprecedented step in 2020 in the wake of the pandemic (known as NextGenerationEU) and some member states believe this should be replicated for defense spending. However, more fiscally conservative nations want to exhaust other options before taking that step.\n\nAccording to Goldman Sachs, EU leaders could \"repurpose\" the outstanding financial capacity from the NextGenerationEU funds for defense. They could then look at a new program, which \"could provide stable funding shielding defence spending from idiosyncratic national factors,\" the analysts added.",

        "full_text": "If there was a silver lining in Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy handing a victory to Vladimir Putin on Friday with the failed minerals deal, it was President Donald Trump effectively luring Putin to the negotiation table through what Putin might see as a more neutral arbiter in Trump.\n\nFriday's Oval Office blowup was \"extremely frustrating\" and a \"missed opportunity for everybody,\" Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., said, because \"Ukraine is still in a precarious position\" before potential talks to end Russia's war on Ukraine.\n\n\"This ultimately, obviously, there needs to be a negotiated settlement,\" Lawler told NPR. \"I think what President Trump is trying to do is get Vladimir Putin to the table for a negotiation.\n\n\"In order to have the strongest possible hand in that negotiation, I think the objective is to have an economic cooperation agreement with Ukraine and the United States, which will strengthen that ability to negotiate.\n\n\"And in order to negotiate a settlement, you need to get both sides to the table. Joe Biden's administration did not engage with Putin for over three years. That obviously complicates the ability to get someone to the table to have an initial discussion.\"\n\nZelenskyy balked at the minerals deal because it did not come with security guarantees, but Lawler noted economic cooperation with Trump's America is de facto security against further Putin aggression.\n\n\"In order for Ukraine to have a very strong hand in the negotiation, the greater the economic cooperation with the U.S. moving forward, the more investment guarantees from the U.S., the easier it will be long term to have security guarantees, and that's important,\" Lawler said.\n\nTrump is playing chess, while Zelenskyy was sticking to his old war-aid talking points he had used during the Biden administration, and Lawler rejected the NPR interviewer's suggestion Trump was scoring an economic prize out of Ukraine.\n\n\"It's not about giving to the U.S.: They're going to need significant economic investment to rebuild when this conflict is over like the rest of Europe during World War II in the aftermath,\" Lawler said.\n\n\"So, having this economic cooperation agreement is critical for the rebuilding efforts moving forward.\n\n\"And by having that level of U.S. investment and engagement, when there is a final agreement, it's going to be a lot harder for Vladimir Putin to renege on it and invade Ukraine again with U.S. investment on the ground.\n\n\"The only winner the other day was Vladimir Putin, that this deal did not happen.\"\n\nBut it just might be the moment that lures Putin to talk a settlement of his war on Ukraine.",

        "full_text": "On a random Tuesday in February, a conservative provocateur and talk radio host made a bold proclamation about the state of the Democratic Party. Donald Trump had won over young men, and nearly a majority of young voters overall in November, because “Democrats, for men, are pussies.”\n\n“There are no masculine men in the Democrat Party right now,” Clay Travis, the Trump-supporting sports and politics commentator, said while speaking on a panel hosted at the University of Chicago. “Who’s the most masculine Democrat right now in America? Mayor Pete?”\n\nHis audience gasped in response. The moderator intervened. And so began a week of debate and commentary about the relationship — or lack thereof — between the Trump-era Democratic Party and the Gen Z men who abandoned them last year.\n\nIn hindsight, all the signs were there that the 2024 election would feature a yawning gender gap between Trump-curious men, and more liberal women. What polls predicted came true: a shift of Gen Z voters toward Republicans, driven by young men voting for Trump. Since then, plenty of postmortems have tried to wrestle with just what went wrong with the Democratic pitch. Still, the question remains: Will this dynamic linger? And if so, how worried should Democrats be?\n\nA month into the second Trump presidency, the alarm bells are still ringing. While the president’s honeymoon is fading, he remains quite popular with the youngest cohort of men.\n\nAs Democrats attempt to redefine themselves ahead of next year’s midterm elections, they’ll need to accurately diagnose why young men have jumped ship in large numbers.\n\nIn reviewing the data and talking to experts, three main explanations emerge.\n\nFirst, there’s the structural: the effects and aftermath of the Covid pandemic and economic pressures that explain the shift of young men to the right.\n\nThen, there are Trump-specific dynamics, related to his persona, his campaign and media strategy last year, and his ability to define himself independently of the two-party, liberal-conservative spectrum.\n\nAnd finally, there are cultural, education, and gender dynamics that explain the divide — which Democrats have driven, and can still fix.\n\nBut if Democrats are to make any progress, their first step must be rooting out denial: When it comes to young men, the party has a real problem.\n\nWhat the Democrats’ young male problem looks like\n\nThe Gen Z gender gap isn’t easy to map out, so it’s helpful to look at a few factors — vote choice, political ideology, partisan identification, and favorability ratings — to try to figure out what’s going on.\n\nThe first, vote choice, is the easiest, but also bluntest, tool to use. Using estimates from AP VoteCast surveys, in 2024, young men backed Trump by a 14-point margin; young women backed Harris by a 17-point margin. Trump’s share of the young male vote increased from 41 percent in 2020 to 56 percent in 2024 per AP VoteCast data by CIRCLE at Tufts University. And it’s young white and Latino men who shifted most dramatically to the right, by 22 points and 38 points respectively.\n\nPartisan identification shows some of this change too. Over the last 20 years, it’s young men who have been more likely to identify as Republicans, according to Gallup polling data. The share of young women, aged 18-29, who identify as or lean toward Democrats has remained steady since about 2003, while the share of young men who identify with Republicans has steadily grown since 2015.\n\nPuzzlingly, the change in partisan leaning has not been accompanied by a corresponding self-reported change in young men’s political ideology. They have not been calling themselves more “conservative” over that same timeline. Instead, it’s young women who have gotten much more liberal over the last two decades, while the share of men who call themselves conservative has remained steady. According to Gallup polling, women 18 to 29 who call themselves liberal are now at the highest level they’ve been since 1999, a trend that picked up during the second Obama term and the first Trump presidency. A plurality of young men, meanwhile, have called themselves moderate over the last 20 years, with shares of young conservatives and young liberals also remaining steady.\n\nWhat this all suggests is two opposite shifts: Young women are identifying as more liberal, but not necessarily more Democratic. Young men, meanwhile, are identifying as more Republican, but not more conservative. It’s a point that Daniel Cox, the director of the American Enterprise Institute’s Survey Center on American Life, was trying to make on the same panel that Travis blew up at the University of Chicago. His argument is that issues, and the positions the political parties are taking, only explain so much.\n\nYoung women are identifying as more liberal, but not necessarily more Democratic. Young men, meanwhile, are identifying as more Republican, but not more conservative.\n\n“You have a slow decline. This didn’t happen in just one election. There’s been a deterioration of Democratic identity among young men for over 10 years,” Cox said. “This group looks a lot more liberal on paper. You had six in 10 young men who are moderates vote for Trump, and more than one in five liberal young men vote for Trump…There’s something about Trump that was attractive and then there’s something about the Democratic Party, at least in its current manifestation, that was repellent.”\n\nExplanation No. 1: It’s bigger than America\n\nThere is no one explanation for these dynamics, but breaking out a few theories can help explain the situation.\n\nWe can start with structural, post-Covid explanations. The shift of young people to the right in general isn’t only happening in the United States, but all over the world. Something about this generation’s experiences, regardless of gender, is causing a rightward shift.\n\nThat shift mirrors the anti-establishment, anti-incumbency trend that democracies have been experiencing since the start of the coronavirus pandemic: frustration with the economic prospects; the squeeze of inflation and prices, and distrust in institutions, which in the US were represented by the Democratic Party. This theory would explain the dramatic shift in vote choices and partisan representation of young men over the last decade, and it is boosted by the fact that both young men and young women swung to Republicans last year — despite those swings being uneven.\n\nOutside of the US, it’s young voters who drove some of the surges of far-right and right-wing political parties across Europe in 2024. As the Atlantic’s Derek Thompson put it recently:\n\nIn France, Germany, Finland, and beyond, young voters are swinging their support toward anti-establishment far-right parties “in numbers equal to and even exceeding older voters.” In Germany, a 2024 survey of 2,000 people showed that young people have adopted a relatively new “gloomy outlook” on the future. No surprise, then, that the far-right Alternative für Deutschland has become the most popular party among Germans under 30. Like most interesting phenomena, this one even has a German name: Rechtsruck, or rightward shift.\n\nThompson points to political science research that has tracked a negative effect on trust in scientific authorities and political leaders as a result of pandemics and epidemics, particularly with those people between the ages of 18 and 25. Declining trust in American institutions — such as the Supreme Court, news media, the presidency, Congress, and big business — all make sense under this view.\n\nThe economics writer Kyla Scanlon argues something similar: that the youngest cohort of Gen Z faces a world of AI-driven disruption and institutional distrust and instability. They’re surrounded by echo chambers that feed their anxiety, and feel looser social connections. In response, they’re embracing more extreme, polarized identities and approaches to the economy and politics.\n\n“Many younger Gen Zers came of age watching political gridlock, rising inequality, and a system that seemed increasingly detached from their lived reality. They saw institutions that refused to adapt (and as of recently, have shown a lack of resilience). They were locked inside during their formative years,” she argues, and so view reality much differently than even the older range of Gen Z.\n\nIn the context of the 2024 election, this theory explains why young Democrats in particular were so down on Joe Biden, and eventually distrustful of Harris and the establishment she came to represent. My own conversations with youth Democratic activists during the election cycle and in its aftermath brought forth many of the same takeaways — that young Democrats found themselves talking to young people who were distrustful of the status quo, of incumbents, and of an older generation of politicians promising change.\n\nBut while these explanations do a solid job explaining the overall shift of Gen Z, they’re less strong on explaining the dramatic lurch right by young men specifically.\n\nExplanation No. 2: There’s something unique about Trump\n\nWhether it was the issues Trump talked about, the salience of those issues to young people, or his campaign strategy and appeal to traditional masculinity, these candidate-specific factors are more persuasive in explaining how a group that reads more liberal on paper could be willing to swing so drastically to the right.\n\nAs Cox of AEI told me, “They’re Trump Republicans, they’re not [traditional] Republicans.” They hold much more progressive views on a range of issues, and are much less aligned with the traditional Republican orthodoxy than standard conservatives, but were Trump-curious, or felt less stigma in being open to voting for him.\n\nMuch of that was due to the media and messaging apparatus Trump and his allies built over the last year, specifically to reach young men. Whether through specific advertising, social media and influencer outreach on YouTube and TikTok, podcast interviews, or other campaign events, Trump saturated the feeds and platforms that young people, especially men, love to consume.\n\nIt worked. Trump posted his strongest gains with groups of young voters who fall into two buckets: those who prioritized the economy and “low-propensity” voters. That second category can be further divided into youth who were least interested or engaged with political news and youth who were voting for the first time.\n\nThese aren’t hardcore conservative, reactionary, or ideological voters. They’re just “not dug in when it comes to politics,” Cox told me. “You look at where young women are on gun control and climate change and reproductive health and LGBTQ rights, and they prioritize these things. Young men are less likely to prioritize any of them. They support some amount of gun control, they’re more pro-choice than pro-life, but it’s not that central to their politics or political identity.”\n\nIn other words, the Trump pitch was persuasive enough to win over a group that might have been destined to break with a Democratic Party that was using the wrong message to try to hold onto their support. But this explanation is unique to Trump and his personal brand and doesn’t necessarily apply to the Republican Party in general or to other Republican politicians.\n\nExplanation No. 3: Democrats are doing something to turn off young men\n\nIf Trump was able to win over young men through his media presence and appeal to masculinity, it suggests Democrats failed to counter that influence — or even did something to make it worse.\n\nCox told me that beyond the specific candidates, there has been a general cultural drift of the Democratic Party’s identity, or perception, among young men that may be a missing piece. Beyond not being “masculine” enough or “too feminine,” there are cultural, class, and educational divides making it harder for the party to hang onto younger men — a party moving left faster than young men are.\n\n“If you look back to George W. Bush and his affect — he went to Yale, he was from an elite pedigree, but he leaned into the blue-collar identity, going out and scrubbing brush and clearing land in his Texas ranch,” Cox said. “This was true then, and it’s more true now, but in an era where people don’t trust slick-talking politicians, the idea of someone using their hands for a living, or pretending to do so, is really resonant. It’s not just a gender gap, but an education divide.”\n\nThis education polarization — of Democrats becoming more of a party of wealthier and better-educated white voters — applies not just to its base, but to its leadership as well. When the messengers, and staffers, running campaigns and formulating the pitches to young voters look less like the people they are trying to reach, “you have just fewer people who are immersed in culturally conversant in ways that can help you craft a winning and effective political message,” he said.\n\nThat cultural shift among Democrats, which includes the party’s embrace of identity politics and progressive social justice-speak, Cox has found, has led to some serious branding problems with young men on a small but influential set of beliefs, specifically affirmative action, LGBTQ, and DEI policies.\n\n“For young white men, their attitudes on various policies related to race are far more conservative than for young white women. There was a really significant divide in perceptions,” Cox said, about privilege and discrimination.\n\nHere, a theory from Vice President JD Vance might actually speak to something that goes beyond ideology or partisanship. Speaking at CPAC last week, Vance argued that “our culture sends a message to young men that you should suppress every masculine urge … don’t allow this broken culture to send you a message that you’re a bad person because you’re a man, because you like to tell a joke, because you like to have a beer with your friends, or because you’re competitive.”\n\nYoung men, especially young white men, over the last 10 years, have grown to feel like underdogs as Democrats and the national culture moved to prioritize marginalized groups or minority communities, the Gen Z writer and strategist Rachel Janfaza explained in the fall. “The left has increasingly focused on uplifting marginalized groups — especially women. But the unintentional consequence of this focus has left young men feeling like no one is speaking to them and that there is no home for them in the Democratic Party.”\n\nStepping into that void are conventional voices like Vance’s or radical ones, like the podcaster Andrew Tate. “Young men are seeing these content creators, podcasters, even politicians, telling them that society is cutting white men out of the picture, or even just all men. And they point to DEI initiatives as this form of wokeness,” Cameron Kasky, a former March for Our Lives gun control and progressive activist, told me. “They say this is an attack on men and white men, and we gotta fight back” by offering alternative models of masculinity that put economic and educational opportunities first.\n\nOn that front, part of the Democratic issue in 2024 might have been that it did not offer an effective alternative “masculinity,” a pro-social, community-focused pitch shared by a credible messenger, instead of mocking young “bros” as “mediocre” or denying that young men feel more isolated.\n\n“Multiple things can be true at once,” Gen Z Democratic strategist Annie Wu Henry told me about this relationship between progressive Democrats and young men last year. “We can acknowledge that white men have historically been the ones given the most privilege and power in society, while also not creating an environment where they feel completely alienated and then turn to spaces like the manosphere online — where they feel seen and accepted — but we also know lead to radicalization and validation of harmful viewpoints of other groups of people.”\n\nDemocrats did not offer an effective alternative “masculinity,” a pro-social, community-focused pitch shared by a credible messenger, instead of mocking young “bros” as “mediocre.”\n\nTo do that, Kasky says, “Democrats need to figure out how to get some swagger back,” and move beyond “Ivy League, fancy” communications.\n\nEven something as small as making a tonal shift will be important. Trump’s favorability among young men, though still higher than with young women, is beginning to trend down, suggesting that last year’s rightward shift might be moderating already.\n\nNone of this has to be permanent\n\nThe fundamental point these theories all make is that none of these attitudes, shifts, or realignments are ironclad — some were specific to the post-pandemic moment, some to the peculiarities of specific candidates, and some to cultural shifts that seem to have stalled. And while voters’ attitudes and perceptions of political parties tend to get ironed out in their youth, this moment of ideological and identitarian tumult might be different.\n\nImportantly for electoral politics and next year’s midterms, the 2024 results suggest that Trump benefited from a youth coalition that isn’t firmly Republican or consistently engaged in politics. The crossover support he received from young moderates and liberals, for example, might not come out to vote in a midterm election, or a non-Trump candidate. And many of their underlying beliefs are still liberal, or progressive on the issues.\n\n“These are not your traditional GOP voters, so whether they come up for a GOP governor or a Senate candidate is very much an open question,” Cox said. “The idea that these voters are not winnable in 2026 and 2028 is crazy. They absolutely are, and I don’t see JD Vance being particularly appealing to them. So the Democratic Party should really think hard about those kinds of voters and the voters that they lost to Trump in 2024.”\n\nBut that Democratic soul-searching will likely create some tensions with other parts of their base and coalitions. Particularly because the most progressive or activist-minded members of the party feel ideologically committed to continue prioritizing minority groups, party leaders may be wary of catering to straight white men. But caring for this demographic will be necessary if they want to reverse Trump’s 2024 gains — and win future elections.",

        "full_text": "Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino.\n\nQuick Take\n\nElon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency have been tasked by President Donald Trump with slashing federal spending. But social media posts falsely claim that as part of that effort, DOGE stopped “royalties” to former President Barack Obama related to the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. The claim came from a satirical website.\n\nFull Story\n\nOn Jan. 20, his first day in office, President Donald Trump established by executive order the new Department of Government Efficiency “to implement the President’s DOGE Agenda,” which has included efforts led by billionaire Elon Musk to reduce government spending and cut the federal payroll.\n\nBut as we’ve written, some of the claims made by DOGE and the Trump administration about overpayments in the Social Security system have been exaggerated, and some claims about spending by the U.S. Agency for International Development have been inaccurate or unsupported.\n\nIn recent days, some social media posts have repeated a fabricated claim that DOGE had halted millions in supposed royalty payments to former President Barack Obama.\n\nA Feb. 27 Threads post falsely claimed, “DOGE stopped an annual payment to Barack Obama for $2.6 million for ‘royalties associated with Obamacare.’ He’s been collecting it since 2010, for a total of $39 million in taxpayer dollars.”\n\nThe posts are referring to the Affordable Care Act, the health care law enacted in 2010 under Obama that became known as Obamacare.\n\nBut the claim that the former president had been receiving royalty payments for the health care law he championed was the invention of America’s Last Line of Defense, or ALLOD, which publishes fabricated political stories and claims on its websites and social media pages that it describes as satirical. ALLOD posted the claim about Obama this month, and the image shared on social media included a stamp labeling the claim as satire.\n\nThe ALLOD website says, “Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined.”\n\nThe other social media posts sharing the claim did not identify the content as satire.\n\nWe could find no evidence that DOGE had stopped any payments to Obama, who as a former president does receive an annual pension payment from the government. Obama has received about $10.5 million from his presidential pension and other government benefits, such as travel and office space, since leaving the White House, The Hill reported. Since he left office at the end of his first term, Trump had received more than $3 million.\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Meta to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

(SAMUEL CORUM/PRESS POOL)\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said President Donald Trump will “meet in the middle” with Mexico and Canada after 25% tariffs on America’s continental neighbors went into effect Tuesday.

        "full_text": "United States immigration officials on Saturday arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian Columbia University graduate who played a leading role in organising the 2024 campus protests at the Ivy League school last year.\n\nAccording to Khalil’s lawyer Amy Greer, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents told her that they would revoke his permanent residency — popularly known as the green card — in the US.\n\nKhalil’s detention and the apparent attempts to deport him represent the most prominent instance of the US government crackdown on student protesters under President Donald Trump, who repeatedly threatened to target universities that are hubs of protests even before his election in November.\n\nSince he was sworn in on January 20, Trump has taken steps to back his plans, including executive orders.\n\nLast week, Trump launched a new tirade, threatening to halt federal funding for schools, colleges, and universities if they allow “illegal protests”.\n\n“Agitators will be imprisoned/or permanently sent back to the country from which they came. American students will be permanently expelled or, depending on the crime, arrested,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n\nOn Friday, the Trump administration pulled $400m in funding from Columbia University, accusing it of failing to combat anti-Semitism.\n\nSo what do we know about Khalil’s arrest, what has Trump done so far, can he compel universities to act against student protesters, and how might higher education institutions respond?\n\nWho are the intended targets?\n\nUS Ambassador-designate to the United Nations Elise Stefanik shared Trump’s remarks last week in a post on X, saying “antisemitism and anti-Israel hate will not be tolerated on American campuses”, confirming that pro-Palestinian protesters and speech critical of Israel are the targets of the president’s threat.\n\nTrump’s announcement comes after he signed a series of executive orders in January targeting alleged anti-Semitism on campuses.\n\nIn one directive, he pledged to deport foreign university students and staff involved in pro-Palestinian protests as part of the crackdown.\n\nHe also created a task force through the attorney general’s office devoted to combating alleged anti-Semitic speech, investigating universities that do not do enough to crack down on such speech.\n\nThe orders and threats come months after huge pro-Palestine, student-led protests swept the country last year as Israel’s genocide raged in Gaza. Students demanded an end to Israel’s military offensive, an end to US support for Israel, and for their universities to divest from companies with ties to Israel.\n\nColumbia University was widely seen as the epicentre of the protests, which resulted in mass arrests and student suspensions, ending in the resignation of the university’s president, Minouche Shafik, several months later.\n\nThe demonstrations also spread to other universities, including Harvard, Yale, and the University of California.\n\nOn Friday — a day before Khalil’s arrest — the Trump administration announced that it was withdrawing $400m in research funding for Columbia.\n\n“Today, we demonstrate to Columbia and other universities that we will not tolerate their appalling inaction any longer,” Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in a statement.\n\nWho is Khalil, and how was he arrested?\n\nKhalil, a Palestinian refugee raised in Syria, graduated in 2024 from Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA). He is married to a US citizen, and his wife is eight months pregnant.\n\nHe was arrested from his university residence on Saturday by ICE agents, the Student Workers of Columbia union said in a statement.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has confirmed the arrest, and in a statement to multiple media organisations, said Khalil was taken into custody as a part of moves made by the agency “in support of President Trump’s executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism”.\n\nIn the statement, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said Khalil “led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization”.\n\nIn a post on X on Sunday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio linked to a news report on Khalil’s arrest and said: “We will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.”\n\nGreer told The Associated Press news agency that ICE agents who arrived at Khalil’s residence initially threatened to arrest his wife too. She said the agents had suggested that Khalil was being held at a facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey. But on Sunday, when his wife tried to visit him there, she was told he was not being kept there.\n\nKhalil was a prominent negotiator on behalf of student protesters as they demanded that the university divest from companies linked to Israel. An encampment set up by student protesters on the campus last year became the epicentre of a nationwide campaign at US universities demanding that Washington stop its unconditional support for Israel, amid the devastating war on Gaza.\n\nCan Trump legally compel universities to stop protests?\n\n“It’s complicated,” said Jenin Younis, a civil liberties and free speech lawyer.\n\n“It’s hard to say that the tweet itself is unlawful since it alone isn’t enforceable,” Younis told Al Jazeera of Trump’s latest post threatening funding. “So, it depends [on] how the administration executes this particular threat, and it has not yet given details.”\n\nRadhika Sainath, a senior lawyer at Palestine Legal, a US-based nonprofit, said the executive orders are not binding rules for universities to follow.\n\n“This executive order sets up a framework to encourage – but not require – schools to spy on and report their non-citizen students and staff,” Sainath told Al Jazeera. “As far as we can tell, these will be non-binding guidelines with no enforcement power or pressure.”\n\nStill, Trump’s directives are extremely concerning, experts said.\n\n“The strength of these orders lies in their chilling effect,” Younes said, adding they are clearly intended to silence First Amendment-protected speech.\n\nFearing consequences, some universities may voluntarily clamp down on speech they believe will subject them to funding cuts, she said, and pressure students and professors alike into silence.\n\nUniversities received $60bn in funding for research and development in 2023, constituting 55 percent of their total budget for science and engineering research.\n\nAccording to Sainath, this is the “most significant escalation in McCarthyite tactics from the Executive Branch regarding Palestine since October 7, [2023]”.\n\nMichael Schaeffer Omer-Man, director of research for Israel-Palestine at the nonprofit DAWN, says Trump’s threats are a “twisted new form of transnational repression”.\n\n“Restricting free speech and expression by cutting state funds, or more accurately, creating a chilling effect by threatening to do so, is a hallmark of autocratic takeovers,” Omer-Man told Al Jazeera, adding that in his view, such tactics can be “as effective as outlawing unpopular political views outright”.\n\nWere universities targeted under Biden’s administration?\n\nYes. Universities that witnessed pro-Palestine protests across the country were also targeted in multiple ways under former US President Joe Biden, who was critical of the student encampments.\n\nUniversity heads had tried, and largely failed, to quell the demonstrations, which often saw the police intervening violently, with videos emerging from different states showing hundreds of students and even faculty members being arrested.\n\nAt Columbia University, several deans resigned, as well as Shafik, who stepped down as president after she was summoned to a congressional committee over allegations the university had failed to protect students and staff from rising anti-Semitism.\n\nAfter the questioning, Shafik allowed police on the campus to arrest students and faced angry calls to resign.\n\nTrump now appears to be doubling down on targeting universities and students. He is “escalating the crackdown” on the Palestine movement and attempting to undermine the students’ and staff’s constitutional rights to speak out and organise, Sainath said.\n\nWill the threats work?\n\nNot on protesters, according to the experts.\n\nOmer-Man said the unprecedented support for Palestine on US campuses was “so powerful precisely because students and faculty already faced consequences for speaking out against Israeli apartheid and stood up anyway”.\n\nStudents have continued to speak up for Palestine ever since Trump unveiled his executive orders.\n\nUniversities, though, are under pressure. This week, Columbia University was forced to reiterate its commitment to “combating anti-Semitism” after Trump’s administration said it could pull more than $50m in contracts between the university and the federal government.\n\nA statement by federal agencies cited the school’s “ongoing inaction in the face of relentless harassment of Jewish students”.\n\nHowever, Omer-Man said young Americans have “never been dissuaded by violent attempts to bury the nation’s conscience”.\n\nSainath agreed.\n\n“Students – and faculty – are continuing to speak out, often at great personal risk, as people of conscience have done throughout history,” she said. “Their voices are key in ending US support for Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza, which is why Israel’s supporters are doing everything they can to stop this growing movement.”\n\nHow might universities respond?\n\nIt might be difficult for universities to legally challenge these executive orders, Younes said.\n\nIt could be “easier to challenge them in a specific case” once the government withholds funds or implements policies pursuant to the executive order, she said.\n\nSainath said it was important for schools to “stay on the right side of history here – they do not have to cooperate and indeed should not cooperate” with these orders.\n\nUniversities should resist pressure to engage in “racist, anti-Palestinian censorship campaigns and protect the right to academic freedom and free speech”, Sainath added.",

        "full_text": "Best Moment\n\nBinyamin Appelbaum Representative Al Green’s stand in defiance of a president who has governed in defiance of the law. Green’s civil disobedience was the behavior of a man who believes that Trump is a threat to American democracy. Why did he stand alone?\n\nJosh Barro Trump boasted of the sharp drop in migrant encounters at the southern border and mocked President Joe Biden’s insistence that better enforcement would require new laws, declaring, “It turned out that all we really needed was a new president.” An effective line on his strongest issue.\n\nFrank Bruni Trump is on solid political ground — and in his comfort zone — when he talks about cracking down on illegal immigration. Among many lies, he truthfully said that fewer migrants were unlawfully crossing the border: “They heard my words, and they chose not to come.” Hard to dispute that.\n\nMichelle Cottle When Trump had the director of the Secret Service make a 13-year-old boy diagnosed with brain cancer an honorary agent. It was a heartwarming plug for the president’s Make America Healthy Again agenda — and a clever way to gloss over the problematic views of his health and human services chief.\n\nMichelle Goldberg Green’s heckling. Democrats shouldn’t have shown up at all, but if they were going to be there, noisy protest made more sense than holding up dumb little paddles. There’s nothing dignified about quietly playing the foil to an autocratic thug gloating about stripping America for parts.\n\nKatherine Mangu-Ward I have long dreamed of a president dedicating a significant portion of a major speech to cuts to the federal government. Alas, the cuts cited by Trump were relatively small, unlikely to withstand scrutiny from the courts or (as in the case of his promises to stop Social Security payments to 129-year-olds) fictional.\n\nDaniel McCarthy The State of the Union and presidential addresses to Congress like Tuesday night’s have become ritualized partisan performances, so when Trump said there was nothing he could do to get Democrats to stand, applaud or smile, he exposed the theatricality of their opposition. (Not that occasional bipartisanship isn’t theatrical, too.)\n\nMatthew Schmitz Trump’s recitation of improbable-sounding expenses he claimed to have cut was funny. More important, it dramatized the growing conviction on the right that too much public money is going to NGOs that operate without direct political accountability.\n\nFarah Stockman Trump is good at made-for-TV moments that celebrate ordinary people — a kid with cancer gets deputized as a U.S. Secret Service agent, a high schooler finds out he got into West Point, a mother is told that her dead daughter has a wildlife refuge named after her.\n\nWorst Moment\n\nAppelbaum It was 90-plus minutes of bad moments — a typical Trump medley of fabrications, provocations and insults. But the worst part was the perversity of Trump performing a democratic ritual even as he breaks this nation’s laws and destroys its institutions.\n\nBarro The section on inflation, which Trump seemed eager to get past because he has nothing to offer. He blamed Biden, he proposed inflationary policies like new tax cuts, and he touted his massive tariffs, despite the “disturbance” they will cause. Voters elected Trump to cut prices, and he is raising them. No wonder he’d rather talk about girls’ volleyball.\n\nBruni What nerve Trump has — accusing Democrats of being too causelessly meanspirited and ceaselessly ungenerous to applaud him as he delivered remarks that, like his entire political career, hinged on mocking and savaging them. Unbelievable. And yet not.\n\nCottle His repeated, literal finger-pointing at the Democratic lawmakers in attendance, as he gloated, trashed Biden and indulged in his characteristic name-calling. “Radical. Left. Lunatics.”\n\nGoldberg Trump’s barrage of easily debunked lies about millions of dead people who could be collecting Social Security checks. The best-case scenario is that he was simply demonstrating, once again, his contempt for the truth, but it seemed like propaganda to justify Social Security cuts.\n\nMangu-Ward Trump’s promise to balance the federal budget was a lie, and everyone in the room knew it. In the coming days, the people in that room will probably pass a continuing resolution that utterly fails to take seriously the real drivers of the deficit: entitlements, military spending and debt service.\n\nMcCarthy The Democrats set themselves up to have the worst moment of the night with their jeering and heckling, especially since it reached full fury as Trump was recounting his popular-vote victory. That made it sound as though the opposition was angry at the American public.\n\nSchmitz The opening section of an overlong speech was wasted on hollow boasting.\n\nStockman When he walked into the Capitol, a place he incited his supporters to storm, cheered by many of the very people who were forced to flee. A very surreal moment.\n\nWhat Else Mattered\n\nAppelbaum The frat boy glee on the Republican side of the aisle.\n\nBarro Trump made good use of Skutniks, especially DJ Daniels, a 13-year-old with cancer whom Trump named as an honorary Secret Service agent. Even though his speech felt interminable — far longer than any State of the Union or joint address to Congress since at least 1964 — these bright moments are what casual observers are likely to see as highlights.\n\nBruni Everything in Trump’s world is extreme, absolute, unnuanced, superlative. Worst ever. Best ever. “Like nothing that has ever been seen before.” Over and over. It’s juvenile. It’s narcissistic. It’s exhausting — like his speech, which made Sunday night’s Oscars seem succinct.\n\nCottle Much of the speech was geared toward painting Democrats as knee-jerk champions of a deeply flawed federal government in which much of the American public has lost faith. Clever.\n\nGoldberg Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has been floating the idea that Trump could reverse his destructive tariffs on Canada and Mexico as soon as Wednesday, but that’s not the message Trump sent on Tuesday night. “Tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs,” he said. “They are about protecting the soul of our country.”\n\nMangu-Ward Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, brought the Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht as his guest. Ulbricht recently received a pardon from Trump, the culmination of years of advocacy by Ulbricht’s mom, Lyn, to free her unjustly imprisoned son.\n\nMcCarthy Trump has become a master of drawing battle lines that put Democrats at a disadvantage, which he did here by weaving guests’ stories of suffering and injustice into his calls for border controls, stronger policing and children’s safety. As controversial as his policies may sound at first, he turns them into common sense.\n\nSchmitz Various European countries have tried Trump’s “gold card” idea to sell citizenship, and several are now backing away from it. It’s a scheme the United States will also come to regret.\n\nStockman Trump didn’t gloat as much as I would have expected when he read a message from President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine offering to sign a mineral deal that was derailed last week after a testy press availability with Trump and his entourage.",

        "full_text": "Fact-checking Trump's address to Congress\n\n5 March 2025\n\nLucy Gilder, Jake Horton & Ben Chu\n\nBBC Verfiy\n\nIn his address to Congress, which ran for more than an hour and a half, President Donald Trump made a series of claims about the state of the US under his predecessor Joe Biden and the achievements of his first weeks in office.\n\nHe returned to key campaign themes including illegal immigration, rising prices and what he called \"appalling waste\" in government spending.\n\nBBC Verify has looked into the facts behind some of his key claims.\n\nDid Trump inherit an economic catastrophe?\n\nTrump said he inherited an \"economic catastrophe\" from Biden.\n\nThis is misleading. The US economy was growing at an annual rate of 2.3% in the final quarter of 2024 under the previous administration. It expanded by 2.8% over 2024 as a whole according to official US statistics.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund estimates that the US growth rate in 2024 was faster than any other nation in the G7.\n\nOn rising prices, Trump added \"we suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country\".\n\nInflation under Biden peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 - the highest level since 1981 - so not quite as far back as Trump claimed.\n\nThe 2022 peak was in the context of high inflation in the rest of the world in the wake of the Covid pandemic and a global energy shock. The inflation rate had dropped to 3% by the time Trump took office.\n\nInflation has also been much higher than 9% at several other points in US history, including the 1940s and 1920s.\n\nDid Biden let egg prices get out of control?\n\nTrump went on to blame Biden for egg prices, claiming he \"let the price of eggs get out of control\".\n\nPrices are high, but this has been linked to a bird flu outbreak in the US.\n\nEgg prices rose under Biden in 2023, and in January a dozen eggs averaged over $5, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). That is 53% above the average for the whole of 2024.\n\nThe USDA has said a bird flu outbreak has led to US farmers having to kill millions of chickens, creating egg shortages, and has announced a $1bn (£780m) plan to help combat the issue.\n\nThe outbreak started in February 2022 and last year the Biden administration allocated more than $800m to tackle it.\n\nThe Trump administration recently fired a number of USDA officials who worked on the government's response to bird flu as part of cost-cutting measures by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). They are now reportedly attempting to rehire some of them.\n\nHas Doge found hundreds of billions in fraud?\n\nTrump praised Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) and claimed the advisory body had found \"hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud\" in federal government spending.\n\nNo evidence has been provided for this figure.\n\nOn its official website, Doge states that it has saved an estimated $105bn, from fraud detection, contract and grant cancellations, real estate lease terminations, asset sales, workforce reductions, programmatic changes, and regulatory savings.\n\nHowever, that figure cannot be independently verified as, so far, Doge has only published \"receipts\" for contract, grant and real estate lease cancellations on the website. These add up to about $18.6bn. We have asked the White House for evidence of the remaining $86bn of savings.\n\nUS media outlets have also highlighted some accounting errors. For example, Doge initially listed its largest saving of $8bn from scrapping an immigration agency contract - it later corrected this to $8m.\n\nWas February the lowest ever month for border crossings?\n\nSpeaking about his actions to tackle illegal immigration, Trump said that \"as a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded\".\n\nThis is true.\n\nIn February 2025, 8,326 encounters of migrants at the south-west border with Mexico were recorded by US Border Patrol.\n\nThis is the lowest level since monthly records began in 2000.\n\nBy comparison, there were 140,641 encounters by US Border Patrol at this border in February last year under Biden.\n\nNumbers fell to 47,316 in December 2024.\n\nDid 21 million migrants enter US under Biden?\n\nContinuing with illegal migration, Trump claimed: \"Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States\".\n\nThere is no evidence for a figure this high.\n\nEncounters with migrants at the borders - a measure of illegal migration - reached 10 million under Biden but this does not mean this many people stayed in the US.\n\nIt is impossible to know exactly how many illegal immigrants have come to the US, as many will have evaded law enforcement agencies, but several estimates put the number at around half what Trump stated.\n\nA report published by the Office of Homeland Security last year estimated the number of illegal immigrants living in the US, as of January 2022, at 11 million.\n\nIt says about a fifth of them arrived in 2010 or later but the majority arrived before this time, some as early as the 1980s.\n\nHas the US spent $350bn on Ukraine?\n\nCorrection: an earlier version of this article stated that migrant encounters at the south-west border fell to 96,000 at the end of 2024. While this is correct for overall encounters here, the number recorded by Border Patrol was 47,316.\n\nAdditional reporting by Shayan Sardarizadeh & Anthony Reuben.",

Al Green for disrupting President Trump’s joint address to Congress.\n\nMr. Green, Texas Democrat, stood up during the first few minutes of the address Tuesday night and shook his cane at the president in response to Mr. Trump declaring he has a mandate from voters to carry out his agenda.\n\n“You have no mandate,” Mr. Green shouted.\n\nHis attempts to disrupt the president prompted warnings from Mr. Johnson and when he did not relent, the speaker had the House sergeant-at-arms remove Mr. Green from the chamber.\n\nMr. Johnson said on Fox News after the speech that he would not tolerate such “shameful” behavior on the House floor, noting Mr. Green’s attacks on the president violate the body’s rules on decorum.\n\n“I suspect that there’ll be a censure resolution brought on the floor to discipline him,” the speaker said. “We have to do that inside the House.

        "full_text": "Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino.\n\nSummary\n\nIn his first address to a joint session of Congress in his second term, President Donald Trump distorted the facts on fraud, immigration, aid to Ukraine, the economy, autism and more.\n\nTrump claimed that the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has “found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud.” However, the DOGE website currently states that the department has only generated $105 billion in savings, and only purports to provide evidence to support $19.8 billion of that total. It’s unclear how much, if any, of that is related to fraud.\n\nThe president read data purportedly showing that millions of dead individuals were incorrectly labeled as alive in the Social Security database, and misleadingly claimed that “money is being paid to many of them.” Social Security Administration internal audits show that the number of dead recipients still being sent benefits is likely in the thousands, not the millions.\n\nIn talking about aid to support Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s invasion, Trump inflated U.S. aid by about double when he claimed that the U.S. has “spent perhaps $350 billion,” and he wrongly claimed Europe had spent only $100 billion. European aid is larger than that from the U.S.\n\nTrump exaggerated when he claimed to have “inherited … an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare” from his predecessor. Economic growth was strong, and inflation had fallen significantly.\n\nHe also wrongly said that inflation was “perhaps” the worst in history under President Joe Biden, and he ignored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic while claiming that the Biden administration “drove up” prices on energy, groceries and other necessities.\n\nTrump misleadingly claimed that “not long ago” just 1 in 10,000 children had autism. Estimates that low are from many decades ago, before the definition and awareness of the condition expanded.\n\nHe misleadingly said Biden’s administration had “closed more than 100 power plants.” According to the Department of Energy, the total number of electric power plants increased by 2,187 from 2020 to 2023. Coal- and petroleum-powered plants decreased.\n\nWhile talking about building up America’s military might, Trump claimed that “now we have the technology” for an air defense system to protect the U.S. like Israel’s Iron Dome. But that technology has not been developed yet, and weapons experts question its feasibility for protecting the entire U.S.\n\nTrump repeated his unsupported claim that “people from mental institutions and insane asylums were released into our country,” and he exaggerated when he again claimed that under Biden “21 million people poured into the United States.”\n\nThe president misleadingly lumped Canada in with Mexico as a significant source of fentanyl in the U.S., claiming those countries have “allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before.” Less than 1% of fentanyl seized by border officials comes through Canada.\n\nIn pushing for more oil and natural gas drilling, Trump, again, falsely claimed that “we have more liquid gold under our feet” than all other nations. There are several countries that have larger estimated oil and natural gas reserves than the U.S.\n\nHe repeated his false claims that 38,000 American lives were lost during construction of the Panama Canal and that Panama had ceded control of the canal to China.\n\nWhile this address, coming early in a new term, technically isn’t a State of the Union address, Trump’s March 4 speech was longer than any prior SOTU, clocking in at an hour and 39 minutes, as measured by the American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\n\nAnalysis\n\nDOGE Savings\n\nTrump claimed that the Department of Government Efficiency, led by White House adviser Elon Musk, has “found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud.” However, the most recent update on DOGE’s website from March 2 reports that the department has only created an estimated $105 billion in savings thus far. Although Trump ticked off several examples of what he called “appalling waste” found by DOGE, it’s unclear if any of the savings touted by DOGE are related to actual fraud.\n\nWe also cannot verify DOGE’s savings figure, as the department has not yet uploaded evidence of each transaction it has conducted. The website includes a “Wall of Receipts” described as “a subset of contract, grant, and lease cancellations, representing ~30% of total savings.”\n\nHowever, the “subset” of transactions listed on the website does not meet this 30% threshold. In total, DOGE’s “Wall of Receipts” lists about $19.8 billion in estimated savings, which is less than 19% of the $105 billion in total savings claimed by the department. Of this $19.8 billion in savings, $8.9 billion comes from the cancellation of contracts, $10.3 billion comes from the termination of grants, and $660 million comes from the termination of government leases.\n\nDOGE has faced scrutiny for inflating and miscalculating the savings figures posted on its website. The New York Times reported that DOGE deleted hundreds of transactions previously posted to its “Wall of Receipts” and also found that DOGE incorrectly claimed credit for canceling government contracts that had already been terminated before Trump entered office. Other errors by DOGE identified in media reports include a typo mislabeling $8 million in savings as $8 billion and triple-counting the cancellation of a single contract.\n\nSpeaking about DOGE’s efforts on Feb. 11, Musk said, “We will make mistakes, but we’ll act quickly to correct any mistakes.”\n\nTrump went on to cite a Government Accountability Office report that estimated annual fraud losses to the government of between $233 billion and $521 billion. But we could not verify how much, if any, of the DOGE savings identified to date includes instances of fraud. Rather, most of the savings appears to be related to spending that it deemed wasteful.\n\nOverstating Social Security Fraud\n\nIn a Feb. 16 post on X, White House adviser Elon Musk shared a screenshot of a spreadsheet denoting that the Social Security database categorizes nearly 21 million people over the age of 99 as alive. Trump read the data from Musk’s post during his speech and misleadingly claimed that “money is being paid to many of” the centenarians still listed as alive.\n\nAs we’ve written, internal audits conducted by the Office of Audit in the Social Security Administration’s Office of the Inspector General have identified that millions of deceased individuals were still listed as living in the Social Security database. However, the number of dead recipients still being sent benefits is likely in the thousands, not the millions.\n\nIn total, the SSA distributed payments to 89,106 individuals aged 99 and older in December 2024.\n\nA July 2023 report published by the Office of Audit found that there were 18.9 million people with Social Security numbers born in 1920 or earlier with no record of their deaths. The vast majority of these records are clearly outdated, as the Pew Research Center estimated that there were only 101,000 Americans who were 100 and older in 2024.\n\nHowever, very few of these dead individuals incorrectly labeled as alive still receive Social Security benefits. Among this group of 18.9 million, the report found that only 44,000, or 0.2%, were still receiving Social Security benefits. The report did not specify how many of these benefit payments were believed to be improper. A portion of the 44,000 recipients were likely living Americans over the age of 103 who continued to receive payments in July 2023.\n\nThe Office of Audit provided a more specific estimate of improper payments to deceased individuals in a November 2021 report. That report concluded that the “SSA issued approximately $298 million in payments to about 24,000 deceased beneficiaries in suspended payment status.” The report also noted that while the SSA did recover some of the funds, $214 million of the improper payments remained unaccounted for.\n\nIn a statement published on Feb. 19, Lee Dudek, the newly appointed acting commissioner of the SSA, explained that the data posted by Musk does not reveal millions of dead individuals who continue to receive benefits.\n\n“I also want to acknowledge recent reporting about the number of people older than age 100 who may be receiving benefits from Social Security,” he said. “The reported data are people in our records with a Social Security number who do not have a date of death associated with their record. These individuals are not necessarily receiving benefits.”\n\nIn September 2015, the SSA began a process that automatically designates individuals aged 115 and older as deceased and ends payments to them.\n\nExaggerating Ukraine Aid\n\nTrump repeated a claim he’s made frequently in recent weeks – telling the joint session of Congress that “we’ve spent perhaps $350 billion” to support Ukraine’s fight against the Russian invasion since 2022, while Europe has spent $100 billion. Those figures are wrong.\n\nAs we’ve written before, the total amount that Congress has appropriated since 2022 is $174.2 billion. According to a report from the special inspector general who is overseeing the U.S. support for Ukraine, the U.S. has made a total of $182.75 billion available for the broader response.\n\nFigures from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German research organization that tracks funding for Ukraine, show that the U.S. has so far allocated about $121 billion compared with about $140 billion from Europe. Additionally, the institute shows that Europe has committed another $122 billion that hasn’t yet been allocated, while the U.S. has committed another $5 billion. The institute’s figures include direct, bilateral aid.\n\nWe didn’t get an immediate response from the White House to an email asking where Trump had gotten his numbers.\n\nWhat Trump Inherited\n\nTrump exaggerated the state of the economy when he took office earlier this year, and he misleadingly placed the blame for higher consumer prices solely on the Biden administration.\n\n“As you know, we inherited, from the last administration, an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare,” Trump said. “Their policies drove up energy prices, pushed up the cost of groceries, and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions of Americans. We suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country — they’re not sure.”\n\nAs we wrote in January, before Trump began his second presidential term, he inherited a “resilient economy that has grown by at least 2.5% every year since he left office in early 2021,” as well as a “post-pandemic jobs boom that has driven the unemployment rate well below the historical norm.”\n\nWe also noted that inflation “has come down significantly” from the annual inflation rate of 9.1% in June 2022. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said that was “the largest 12-month change since the period ending November 1981” — not in history, as Trump said. Most recently, the Consumer Price Index increased 3% for the 12-month period ending in January.\n\nIt’s also wrong to suggest that Biden administration policies alone increased prices on energy, food and other consumer goods. As we’ve also written, economists primarily blame the COVID-19 pandemic, the supply chain disruptions that followed and rising labor costs, among other reasons, for the dramatic price increases while Biden was president.\n\nAutism\n\nShortly after introducing DJ Daniel, a 13-year-old who was diagnosed six years ago with brain cancer, Trump cited two autism prevalence figures that need context.\n\n“Our goal is to get toxins out of our environment, poisons out of our food supply, and keep our children healthy and strong,” the president said. “As an example, not long ago — and you can’t even believe these numbers — 1 in 10,000 children had autism. 1 in 10,000. And now it’s 1 in 36. There’s something wrong. 1 in 36 — think of it.\n\n“So we’re going to find out what it is and there’s nobody better than Bobby and all of the people that are working with you,” he continued, referring to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., “to figure out what is going on.”\n\nTrump made nearly identical remarks about the autism rate on Feb. 13 when swearing in Kennedy as the new health secretary.\n\nTrump’s higher figure of 1 in 36 is correct. That’s the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s latest estimate, in 2020, of the number of U.S. children who have been identified with autism.\n\nThe 1 in 10,000 number, however, is decades old — and isn’t directly comparable to today’s figure. As we’ve explained before, some studies in the 1960s and ’70s estimated autism affected about 1 to 5 in 10,000 kids. But these studies used a much more stringent definition of autism. Awareness and recognition of autism has also dramatically improved since then.\n\nMuch of “what is going on,” then, is actually a broader clinical definition of autism capturing more mild cases, along with better awareness. There may be a slight true increase in the condition, researchers say, in part due to known risk factors, including parents having children at older ages and more babies surviving birth complications. Autism is largely a genetic disease.\n\nKennedy and others around him have previously used the same or similar statistics to falsely suggest that vaccines may be behind the surge in autism diagnoses. Numerous studies have failed to find any link between autism and vaccines.\n\nPower Plants\n\nTrump said the Biden administration had “closed more than 100 power plants.” That’s misleading. The number of electric power plants went up by 2,187 since the last full year of Trump’s first administration to 2023, according to the latest data from the Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration.\n\nThe number of power plants fueled by coal did decrease by 57 plants, from 284 in 2020 to 227 in 2023. Plants powered by petroleum and other fossil gas also declined by 23 plants. But the number of other types of electric power plants, including natural gas and renewable energy, went up.\n\nIn April 2024, a rule finalized by the Biden administration to limit the pollution from existing coal power plants required those plants, and any new natural gas-fired power plants, to capture 90% of their carbon emissions by 2032, if they intend to operate after 2039. The rule was contested by some Republican states and industry groups, but in October the Supreme Court decided that the rule could go into effect while legal cases work their way through the courts. During his campaign, Trump promised to kill Biden’s power plant rules.\n\nEnergy Secretary Chris Wright recently advocated for the need for coal-fired power plants, Bloomberg reported. In February, the EIA reported that electricity generators plan to retire about 8 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity this year.\n\nDuring his address to Congress on Tuesday night, Trump said, “We are opening up many of those power plants right now.”\n\nGolden Dome Defense System\n\nTrump said he is focused on “building the most powerful military of the future,” and one of the first steps will be building a “Golden Dome missile defense shield to protect our homeland.”\n\n“Ronald Reagan wanted to do it long ago,” Trump said, “but the technology just wasn’t there, not even close. But now we have the technology. It’s incredible, actually. And other places, they have it. Israel has it. Other places have it, and the United States should have it too, right?”\n\nBut the technology for the U.S. isn’t there yet.\n\nTrump said repeatedly during his campaign that during his presidency the U.S. would develop a missile defense system similar to Israel’s Iron Dome. Israel has used that air defense system since 2011 to shoot down short-range rockets fired from neighboring Gaza. Israel’s Iron Dome, along with its Arrow 3 system — an air defense system that can intercept ballistic missiles — and with help from the U.S. and others, shot down nearly 300 drones and missiles launched at Israel by Iran in April 2024.\n\nIsrael’s system, developed by an Israeli company and the U.S. weapons manufacturer Raytheon, can detect and intercept “a variety of shorter-range targets such as rockets, artillery and mortars,” Raytheon’s website explains. The system can target threats launched from 2.5 to 43.5 miles away.\n\nBut “against the normal threats to U.S. security, the Iron Dome is not a useful system,” Stephen Biddle, adjunct senior fellow for defense policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, told us when we wrote about this issue last year. “Iron Dome is designed to deal with short-range threats, especially unguided rockets,” not long-range ballistic missiles that could be launched by China, Russia or North Korea.\n\n“If the North Koreans launched intercontinental ballistic missiles at the U.S., an Iron Dome would not be able to intercept reentry vehicles,” explained Biddle, referring to the parts of intercontinental ballistic missiles carrying warheads back into Earth’s atmosphere before hitting a target.\n\nThe defense technology company Lockheed Martin is apparently working on a “Golden Dome” system that Trump referred to in his remarks to Congress, and the Pentagon is seeking proposals from other defense contractors. The Lockheed Martin website says, “[W]e will bring in the best and brightest of American innovation to rapidly develop game-changing tech – like space-based interceptors and hypersonic defenses – that will ensure America’s Golden Dome stays well ahead of adversary threats.”\n\nBut the Golden Dome technology is still being developed, and defense experts are skeptical that a missile defense system will be able to protect the entire U.S.\n\nImmigration\n\nTrump made several misleading and unsupported claims about immigration.\n\nTrump began by boasting that after declaring a national emergency on the southern border and cracking down on illegal immigration, by February, his first full month in office, apprehensions of those crossing the border illegally “were by far the lowest ever recorded.”\n\nAlthough U.S. Customs and Border Protection has not yet released its official February apprehensions data, the agency reported via X on March 1 that February “saw just 8,326 encounters at the Southwest border—the lowest documented by U.S. Border Patrol.” That eclipses the figure of 11,127 in April 2017, Trump’s third full month in office during his first term — and previously the lowest month going back to at least 2000. However, it’s not the lowest “ever recorded.” Government data going back to 1925 shows entire years in the 1920s and 1930s that were close to the February figure.\n\nTrump went on to say that under Biden, “there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month.” Illegal immigration did soar through most of the years Biden was in office, with apprehensions by Border Patrol averaging about 150,000 per month. Apprehensions reached a monthly high of 251,178 in December 2023.\n\nBut the numbers dropped dramatically after Biden enacted emergency measures in June 2024 to restrict asylum eligibility for those illegal border-crossers. Between July and December, the last full month under Biden, apprehensions of people crossing the border illegally averaged about 55,000 per month. That’s lower than the average during the last few months of Trump’s first term.\n\nWe should note that after tough talk on immigration in the 2016 campaign, the number of apprehensions plummeted in the first few months of Trump’s first term as well, what some referred to as “the Trump Effect.” After that dip in the months immediately after he took office, apprehensions of illegal border-crossers steadily increased over the next two years, reaching a peak of 132,856 in May 2019. The figures then began to steadily decline again, going to 16,182 in April 2020 at the height of the pandemic.\n\nTrump also made his oft-repeated but unsupported claim that “people from mental institutions and insane asylums were released into our country.” As we have written, immigration experts in the U.S. and in countries in South America where Trump has alleged that kind of activity have told us they have seen no evidence of that.\n\nAnd finally, Trump claimed that “over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States.” As we have written, that’s double the total number of people caught trying to enter the country illegally (7.3 million, which includes repeat attempts), those who came to legal ports of entry without authorization to enter (1.2 million), and the estimated number who evaded capture (2 million). Comprehensive Department of Homeland Security data on the initial processing of these encounters show that 2.9 million were removed by CBP and 3.2 million were released with notices to appear in immigration court or report to Immigration and Customs Enforcement or given other classifications, such as parole.\n\nFentanyl Smuggling\n\nWhile talking about his reasons for putting new 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, Trump claimed that both countries have “allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens.” But comparing Canada to Mexico is misleading.\n\nNo one knows exactly how much illicit fentanyl comes into the U.S. each year because comprehensive data is not available. U.S. Customs and Border Protection does publish drug seizure statistics, which are often used as a proxy for how much gets into the country undetected.\n\nThe 43 pounds of fentanyl seized by authorities at the northern border in fiscal year 2024 is more than the 2 pounds seized in fiscal 2023 and the 14 pounds seized in fiscal 2022. But that is significantly less than the 21,148 pounds of fentanyl seized by officials at the southwest border with Mexico during the 2024 fiscal cycle.\n\nAs we’ve written, for at least the last three full fiscal years, the amount of fentanyl captured coming into the U.S. from Canada has made up less than 1% of the fentanyl seized nationwide by the Border Patrol and the Office of Field Operations.\n\n‘Liquid Gold’\n\nTrump repeated a false claim about the oil and natural gas reserves in the U.S.\n\n“As you’ve heard me say many times, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on earth, and by far,” Trump said. “And now, I fully authorize the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it. It’s called drill, baby, drill.”\n\nAs we’ve written before, Trump is wrong. The Brookings Institution has noted that while “estimating reserves is an inexact science and methodologies differ,” the U.S. generally ranks between ninth and 11th in the world in the size of its crude oil reserves, and it ranks fourth or fifth in recoverable natural gas reserves.\n\nAnd although Trump would like oil and gas companies to do more drilling, it’s worth noting that oil and gas production in the U.S. already reached new record levels in 2024.\n\nPanama Canal\n\nTrump wrongly repeated his claims that 38,000 American lives were lost during construction of the Panama Canal and that Panama had ceded control of the canal to China.\n\nThe canal was “built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure, 38,000 workers died building the Panama Canal. They died of malaria. They died of snake bites and mosquitoes. Not a nice place to work,” Trump said.\n\nAs we have written, Trump grossly overstates the number of American lives lost building the canal. About 7,600 people died during the more than decade-long American phase of the construction of the Panama Canal, which started in 1904, according to Noel Maurer, an associate professor of international affairs and international business at George Washington University, and co-author of the book, “The Big Ditch: How America Took, Built, Ran, and Ultimately Gave Away the Panama Canal.”\n\nMost of those deaths weren’t Americans, Maurer told us via email. “Rather, about two-thirds of them were either West Indian (mostly from Barbados), and a smaller unknown share of Spanish laborers who were hired at the start of construction.” In total, fewer than 1,000 Americans died due to accident or infectious disease during the canal’s construction phase, he said.\n\nTrump also continued to falsely suggest that China has been operating the canal.\n\nThe canal “was given away by the Carter administration for $1 but that agreement has been violated very severely,” Trump said. “We didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.”\n\nIt’s not accurate to say the canal was given to China. A Hong Kong-based company managed ports at either end of the canal, which has raised concerns among some in the U.S., including the head of U.S. Southern Command, who last year warned Congress the ports could be used by the Chinese military as “points of future multi-domain access.” But canal experts and Panamanian officials have said China had no involvement in operation of the canal.\n\nAnd in any case, as Trump noted in his speech, an American investment group led by BlackRock has agreed to purchase both ports owned by the Hong Kong company.",

        "full_text": "When the 2024 election turned an ex-president into the next president, most Americans — no matter their feelings about Donald Trump — must have quite reasonably assumed they knew exactly what they were getting.\n\nIt turns out they didn’t know — not exactly.\n\nThe 43 days of his second term have revealed a president in the grip of a set of large ideas that were an occasional but far from a paramount feature of his first term. This version of Trump is more serious — determined to dismember large parts of the federal government and upend relations between the United States and the rest of the world on trade and security. He is ready to pursue these ideas in a sustained and pitiless way, all the while asserting vast new powers for himself as president.\n\nThis version of Trump cherry-picked examples of federal spending that sounded dubious or even inane, like a purported $20 million to subsidize an Arab version of “Sesame Street” in the Middle East. He asserted that Social Security databases supposedly include many millions of people over the age of 120. He waged cultural warfare, promising to stand up to school systems allegedly proselytizing on behalf of gender fluidity for confused young adolescents against parental wishes.\n\nThe speech, infused with a MAGA-brand overhaul of conservatism, was as if a classic Ronald Reagan speech were recrafted for late-night delivery at a tavern in Queens. He made a dozen or so references to his immediate predecessor, calling Biden “the worst president in American history.” He accurately noted that attempted border crossings from Mexico have plunged dramatically since he came into office and asserted that Democrats allowed “murderers, drug dealers, gang members and people from mental institutions and insane asylums … into our country. Who would want to do that?”\n\nThis was above all a speech aimed at communicating with Trump’s 2024 coalition. That includes large numbers of voters who share his grievances and are zealously devoted to him, combined with just enough additional voters who might not be crazy about Trump but think the Democrats are too out of touch to be an acceptable alternative.\n\nThe speech included almost no language aimed at persuading Democrats that there are some issues on which they could work with him. It’s clear that the only pathway to that would be them admitting they were wrong for all these years and Trump is great after all. His aim, instead, was to use the opposition party as speech props.\n\n“I look at the Democrats in front of me, and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy, or to make them stand or smile or applaud,” Trump taunted. “I could find a cure to the most devastating disease, a disease that would wipe out entire nations, or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history, or the stoppage of crime to the lowest levels ever recorded. And these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements.”\n\nTrump is so aggressive in his rhetorical style that it can be easy to overlook that he can also be a shrewdly defensive-minded politician. He called out Elon Musk in the House gallery but didn’t offer any extended defense of the most controversial dimensions of the administration’s efforts to use the Department of Government Efficiency to sharply cut the federal workforce, or the White House’s campaign to strip the independence of federal agencies that have been historically insulated from politics. These efforts are already immersed in legal battles, most likely to be settled by the Supreme Court justices who watched Trump’s speech from the front row.\n\nInstead, he offered himself as an evangelist for common sense and kept the argument on examples of foreign aid spending that he knows is unpopular with many Americans, such as “$8 million to promote LGBTQI+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of.”\n\nHe was eager to talk about cultural issues, such as his executive orders making English the country’s official language or that federal policy is that “there are only two genders — male and female.” But he didn’t make a mention of opposition to legal abortion, the cultural issue that sustained the conservative movement for a half-century.\n\nLast week, Trump dominated conversation in Washington and around the world when he and Vice President JD Vance denounced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy before cameras in the Oval Office as an ingrate and threatened to abandon further U.S. support for Ukraine’s effort to fight a Russian invasion. In the speech, however, Trump announced that Zelenskyy wrote him a letter of appreciation and is ready for Trump’s mediation in peace talks.\n\nFor as long as Trump has been a national figure — dating to the 1980s, decades before he formally entered politics — he has some enduring political instincts. He has consistently warned that America risks decline by letting other countries take unfair advantage and has rarely hesitated to engage in hot-button cultural debates.\n\nEven in the first term, however, these instincts didn’t always coalesce into a fully developed ideological program. He appointed conservative judges. He started but did not finish a promised wall on the southern border. But his interests could seem episodic, bouncing around with the news.\n\nIt is now clear that the four years he spent out of power were devoted — by him and by key lieutenants in his administration — to a detailed plan for what they would do if and when he got back in. And it is clear from Tuesday night’s speech that he is confident in his ability to sell a breathtakingly ambitious and divisive agenda to a majority of Americans.",

        "full_text": "President Trump delivered the first congressional address of his second term on Tuesday evening.\n\nIt was a chance for the president to underscore the sweeping changes he has wrought in the six weeks since he returned to the White House — and to defend those moves from his many critics.\n\nThe days preceding the address were dominated by two issues: Ukraine and the economy.\n\nThe first topic is in a state of flux amid reverberations from last week’s fractious meeting between Trump, Vice President Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nOn the economy, stock markets swooned Tuesday amid concerns about Trump’s newest tariffs, aimed at Mexico, Canada and China.\n\nOn Tuesday night, there was much other news too.\n\nHere are the big takeaways.\n\nTrump set out his case from the speech’s opening moments, characterizing his first weeks back in office as being marked by “swift and unrelenting action.”\n\nIn the roughly 100 minutes that followed, he put flesh on that argument, referencing his restrictions on illegal immigration, his executive orders assailing “wokeness,” the work of billionaire ally Elon Musk and Trump’s own assault on what he calls Washington’s bureaucratic “swamp.”\n\nMusk was present for the address — dressed, uncharacteristically, in a suit — while some Democrats held signs proclaiming “Musk steals.”\n\nTrump claimed popular opinion is the wind at his back: “Americans have given us a mandate for bold and profound change.”\n\nBut have they?\n\nTrump defeated former Vice President Kamala Harris by just 1.5 percentage points in the popular vote last November, polls show Americans closely split on his performance thus far, and Musk, a central figure, seems to grow more divisive by the day.\n\nTrump adopted a taunting tone toward Democrats during much of the address.\n\nThe president called former President Biden “the worst president in American history,” referenced the criminal cases that he had faced, asking, “How did that work out?” and resurrected an old derogatory nickname for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) when she applauded in support of continued aid for Ukraine.\n\n“Do you want to keep it going for another five years? Yeah? You would say — Pocahontas says yes,” Trump said, nodding in Warren’s direction.\n\nWarren, asked a short time later if she was surprised by the jab, said, “No. The whole speech was a fantasy that Donald Trump tries to construct.”\n\nTrump took a less hostile tone toward Zelensky than he has during the past week. But it remains unclear exactly how the president sees the path forward.\n\nThe president said he had received a letter from Zelensky earlier Tuesday, though he appeared to be referencing the same message the Ukrainian president had posted on social media.\n\nNonetheless, Trump characterized the message as “important” — especially with respect to the Ukrainian willingness to make peace and to sign on to the mineral rights deal the U.S. has sought.\n\nBut the president made no promises of security guarantees, which the Ukrainians regard as vital.\n\nTrump contended his administration had held “serious discussions with Russia and have received strong signals that they are ready for peace.”\n\n“Wouldn’t that be beautiful?” he added.\n\nHe provided no specificity on what those “signals” might be, nor on what, if anything, Russian President Vladimir Putin might be prepared to concede to end the war that his February 2022 invasion started.\n\nTrump’s pause of military aid to Ukraine, which has caused tremors across Europe, remains in place.\n\nImmigration was Trump’s single strongest issue during last year’s election campaign, with polls showing voters preferred his harder line over the Democrats’ approach by a wide margin.\n\nIt was, therefore, no surprise that Trump leaned hard into the issue Tuesday night.\n\nOne of his loudest applause lines came when he mocked those who had suggested that significant reductions in unauthorized migration could only come through the passage of major legislation.\n\n“It turned out all we really needed was a new president,” he said, sparking a roar of approval from Republicans in the chamber.\n\nTrump also emphasized the most emotive elements of the issue, paying tribute to Laken Riley, the 22-year-old college student killed by an unauthorized migrant in Georgia in 2024, and to Jocelyn Nungaray, a 12-year-old girl killed in Texas, also in 2024. Two unauthorized migrants have been charged with Nungaray’s murder.\n\nRiley’s sister and mother attended the speech, as did Nungaray’s mother. All three were acknowledged directly by Trump.\n\nMore broadly, Trump contended that his “most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history” was helping to achieve “the great liberation of America.”\n\nOne of the most telling passages in the address came with Trump’s defense of his tariffs — and the notably tepid response it received even from Republicans.\n\nTrump’s rationale for the tariffs appeared rather meandering at times.\n\nHe contended they were necessary to stop the United States being taken advantage of by other nations, would help American farmers stave off foreign competition, and would boost the nation’s finances.\n\nBut the fact that his speech took place on a second day of steep stock market falls — and amid consternation from some conservatives — took the luster off those arguments.\n\n“Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it’s happening, and it will happen rather quickly,” Trump said.\n\n“There’ll be a little disturbance, but we’re OK with that. It won’t be much,” Trump insisted.\n\nRepublicans duly applauded but with notably less zest than when Trump was on safer ground, defending his immigration restrictions or weighing in on the culture wars.\n\nRep. Al Green (D-Texas) interrupted Trump with heckling early in the speech.\n\nGreen was hitting back at Trump’s assertion that he had a broad mandate, protesting that the president had no “mandate to cut Medicaid.”\n\nAfter a warning from Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) that Green was engaging in a “breach of decorum,” the Texas congressman — who filed articles of impeachment against Trump several times during his first term, and said he would do so again last month — continued to voice his objections.\n\nGreen was ultimately escorted from the chamber without resistance.\n\nSoon after, Green told reporters he had launched his protest because it was the most effective method to “get across to a person who uses … his incivility against our civility.”\n\nGreen also acknowledged he might face some form of sanction for his protest.\n\n“Whatever the punishment is, I’m not fighting the punishment,” Green said.\n\nAlexander Bolton and Jared Gans contributed.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc.

        "full_text": "In a few weeks, Donald Trump has done what his prevaricating predecessor declared to be impossible: he has brought the border under control. Those of us who watch the goings and comings of illegal border crossings are familiar that Donald Trump 45 did a stellar job of taking a border crisis and bringing it within appropriate management.\n\nFor instance, in the Yuma sector alone, Trump 45 brought encounters with illegal aliens to a previously unheard of 8600 in the last year of Trump’s first term. That was astounding, especially in light of Biden’s border crisis which often saw more encounters in a weekend than in Trump’s entire last year.\n\nBut now, under Trump 47’s policies, the number of encounters has dropped to about 8600 for the entire border—north, south, land, and sea. Miraculous, some would say. ICE’s arrests of illegals have increased over 600% compared to Biden. Migrant shelters have shut down due to a lack of use. I say it is a monumental change. Unheard of. What President Trump 47 has done is to demonstrate clearly that enforcing the law is the biggest inducement for illegal aliens to stay away or to go home.\n\nDuring one briefing I had with top CBP leaders, I was told that caravans that had formed during Biden’s last days in office, and were trying to get to the border before President Trump was inaugurated, had turned around the day of his inauguration. Simply promising to enforce the law and prevent entry had caused caravans of those intent on breaching our border to disband.\n\nThis kind of border control has never been established under any previous presidential administration. And what do the Leftists who control some of our major cities have to say?\n\nIn Denver, the Mayor promised a “Tiananmen Square moment” to prevent enforcement of our laws. Of course, his promise of obstruction of legal enforcement activities shows his contempt for the law.\n\nHe joins the mayors of Chicago, Boston, Tucson, and the governors of Arizona and California in proclaiming their jurisdictions off limits to enforcement of immigration laws. They are the last holdouts of lawlessness in a nation that has been ravaged by an invasion of illegal aliens under the malevolent Biden Administration.\n\nNever forget that Biden and his Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas insisted that the borders should be open and humane. The result was millions of illegal aliens poured into America, many hundreds of thousands were criminals who preyed upon American citizens.\n\nBiden and Mayorkas claimed that there was no way to stop the onslaught, so they created programs to facilitate illegal entry into the United States, prevent law enforcement from doing its job, and launder billions of dollars to cartels through nongovernment organizations (NGOs).\n\nBiden and Mayorkas attempted to kill our border and American sovereignty under the guise of humanity. They didn’t care about human smuggling, trafficking, child trafficking, and sex trafficking. They didn’t care about the rapine imposed upon most women and girls and many men and boys by the violently evil criminal cartels who controlled our southern border. They didn’t flinch at the hundreds of thousands of Americans who died due to fentanyl poisoning.\n\nThe policies of Joe Biden and Alejandro Mayorkas will forever be a stain on America.\n\nThe border is now almost completely controlled by America, not Mexican drug and human trafficking cartels.\n\nThat only has happened because President Trump has the will and leadership skills to allow our law enforcement to actually enforce the law. Trump said he would do it. He is doing it. Kudos to him, the leadership at the Department of Homeland Security, and its enforcement agencies. And thanks to the frontline CBP agents and ICE officers.\n\nAmerica is safer now. Our borders are better now. Trump is delivering on one of his signature campaign promises. While the Left in America is face-melting, the majority of us recognize the success on the border of President Trump.",

        "full_text": "A federal appeals court on Wednesday allowed the Trump administration to remove a top federal ethics watchdog from his office while a lawsuit challenging his termination plays out.\n\nThe order permitting the removal of Hampton Dellinger as head of the Office of Special Counsel came four days after a federal district court judge ruled that President Donald Trump's attempt to boot Dellinger was \"unlawful, and as the special counsel opposes the terminations of probationary employees throughout the government by the Trump administration.\n\nHowever, the order by a unanimous three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit left open the question of whether Dellinger will be able to return to his position pending the outcome of the Trump administration's appeal in the case.\n\nThe panel, which said it would issue an opinion explaining its order \"in due course,\" also expedited the case, setting a briefing schedule that will end April 11.\n\n\"The Clerk is directed to calendar this case for oral argument this term on the first appropriate date following the completion of briefing,\" the panel wrote.\n\nSince being filed by Dellinger, the case has already landed in the lap of the Supreme Court once, albeit briefly. And the high court is likely to have the final say on whether Trump has the power to dismiss the special counsel.\n\nCNBC has requested comment from Dellinger and his attorneys.\n\nDellinger, who had a five-year term, was appointed as special counsel in March 2024 by then-President Joe Biden, and later confirmed by the Senate.\n\nTrump fired Dellinger by email last month as part of a wide-ranging effort to reduce the number of federal workers.\n\nDellinger's office is responsible for protecting federal employees who act as whistleblowers about illegal or unethical conduct.\n\nDellinger sued the Trump administration in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., over his termination.\n\nHe argued his dismissal was illegal because of a federal law that says special counsels can only be removed by the president \"for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance of office.\"\n\nDistrict Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson on Feb. 10 issued an order barring Dellinger's removal as the case continued.\n\nThe Trump administration then appealed to the Court of Appeals, which in a 2-1 ruling declined to overturn Berman's order.\n\nThe Department of Justice then asked the Supreme Court to rule that Trump had the power to fire Dellinger. But the Supreme Court declined to do so, for now, letting the case wind its way through lower federal courts.\n\nBerman then ruled on Saturday that Trump's firing was unlawful.\n\n\"The Special Counsel's job is to look into and expose unethical or unlawful practices directed at federal civil servants, and to help ensure that whistleblowers who disclose fraud, waste, and abuse on the part of government agencies can do so without suffering reprisals,\" Jackson wrote in her ruling.\n\n\"It would be ironic, to say the least, and inimical to the ends furthered by the statute if the Special Counsel himself could be chilled in his work by fear of arbitrary or partisan removal,\" Jackson wrote.\n\nThe DOJ immediately asked the Court of Appeals in an emergency motion to stay Jackson's ruling pending the outcome of its appeal of that decision.\n\nIn its order Wednesday, the three judges on the appeals court panel said the Trump administration had \"satisfied the stringent requirements for a stay pending appeal.\"\n\n\"This order gives effect to the removal of appellee [Dellinger] from his position as Special Counsel of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel,\" the order noted.\n\nIn the weeks since Trump first tried to fire Dellinger, the special counsel had opposed the president's efforts to fire probationary employees across several federal agencies.",

        "full_text": "Washington — House Republicans are pursuing a stopgap measure to keep the government funded through September, looking to shore up support for the continuing resolution with less than 10 days to prevent a government shutdown.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson has outlined plans for the measure, which is expected to extend funding at current levels through the end of the fiscal year, Sept. 30, and has the backing of President Trump.\n\n\"Conservatives will love this Bill,\" Mr. Trump said Wednesday on social media, calling the continuing resolution \"very important.\"\n\n\"Let's get this Bill done!\" Mr. Trump added.\n\nBut Republicans are facing pressure to do so without support from Democrats. And whether Johnson can get the measure through the House, with a razor-thin Republican majority, remains to be seen.\n\nMembers of the House Freedom Caucus, who often oppose the temporary funding measures, met with the president at the White House Wednesday as Republicans move forward with the funding plan, which could be voted on early next week. After the meeting, Rep. Lauren Boebert said they're ready to move forward with a continuing resolution, called a CR for short, so that the president's agenda can move forward. But other caucus members said they need to see the text first.\n\n\"Look, we haven't seen the final form of the CR,\" said Rep. Andy Harris. \"In concept, the president has said he needs this for his agenda. We support the president's agenda.\"\n\nJohnson told reporters Tuesday that he's hoping to release the text of the continuing resolution by the end of the week.\n\nIn recent years, funding the government has created a headache for Johnson and his predecessor, former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, because of the narrow GOP majority in the House and opposition to temporary funding measures by a group of conservative hardliners. The dynamic has repeatedly forced Republicans to rely on Democrats to keep the government funded, fueling frustration among members of the House GOP ranks.\n\nBut Democrats, now in the minority in both chambers and with few opportunities for leverage, are in a different position. As the Trump administration works to dramatically and quickly downsize large swaths of the executive branch, Democrats have been seeking guardrails on Mr. Trump's ability to withhold funding approved by Congress and are intent on including language in the funding measure. Without the guardrails, Democrats argue that the stopgap measure would give the administration more opportunities to cut federal programs.\n\nJohnson told reporters Tuesday that he thinks what Democrats are requesting is \"unconstitutional,\" saying \"this should be a conversation about numbers, and not about limiting the other branch of government.\"\n\nWithout support from Democrats, House Republicans must keep their conference in line to approve the stopgap measure. Johnson has touted the approach in recent days, which he billed as one that would keep the government open while House Republicans work to incorporate savings from the DOGE effort and revenue brought in by Trump administration policies. He noted on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" Sunday that the DOGE cuts wouldn't be included in the forthcoming continuing resolution, while promising a \"very different process\" on next year's funding.\n\nDuring the last funding fight in December, Johnson pushed for an extension until March to set Republicans up to reach an agreement on new spending bills with a GOP trifecta in Washington. And he noted at the time that House Republicans were aiming to resolve the government funding fight earlier in the year, before the March 14 deadline. But the existing dynamics have persisted, even with Republican majorities in both chambers.\n\nAmid the standoff and approaching deadline, Republicans and Democrats have begun blaming each other. While Republicans say Democrats are flirting with a shutdown with their demands, Democrats argue that the GOP majorities would be responsible for any possible shutdown, and they claim Republicans have left the negotiating table.\n\nSen. Patty Murray, the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, said Tuesday that she's urging Republican leadership to work on new, full-year funding bills and prevent a shutdown with a shorter continuing resolution. She stressed that Democrats \"cannot stand by and accept\" what she called a \"power grab CR that would help Elon take a chainsaw to programs that families rely on.\"\n\n\"I'm ready to pass a short-term CR immediately to take down the risk of a shutdown so that we can finish our negotiations and write our full-year spending bills, which is our job to do,\" Murray added.\n\nEven if House Republicans can approve the six-month funding measure along party lines, a 60-vote threshold in the Senate means the measure would require the backing of at least seven Democrats to be approved in the upper chamber. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, however, who has said \"Republicans are responsible for funding the government,\" called for collaboration on a solution.\n\n\"We believe, we've always believed, the only solution is a bipartisan solution,\" Schumer said.\n\n, and contributed to this report.",

        "full_text": "A terrorist from the Islamic State – Khorasan Province (ISIS-K), who was extradited to the United States in the early Wednesday morning hours, confessed to the FBI that he played key roles in the infamous bombing of Abbey Gate at the Kabul, Afghanistan airport that took the lives of soldiers and civilians, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. He also claimed taking part in a deadly attack on a concert hall in Moscow, and a blast targeting Canadian embassy security guards in Kabul.\n\nMohammad Sharifullah's capture in a joint raid between Pakistani intelligence and the Central Intelligence Agency was announced by President Donald Trump at a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night, revealing that the U.S. had captured Sharifullah, also known as “Jafar.” Trump also told the nation that Sharifullah is believed to be one of the ISIS-K terrorists responsible for the August 2021 Abbey Gate terrorist attack that killed 13 American troops during the bungled withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nJafar landed in U.S. custody at Washington Dulles International Airport and has an initial court appearance Wednesday in Alexandria, Virginia. New FBI court documents shed further light on the slew of attacks in which Sharifullah has claimed a role.\n\nSharifullah was read his \"Miranda rights\" by the FBI and he proceeded to tell them he was recruited into ISIS-K around 2016. The FBI said the terrorist was imprisoned in Afghanistan from approximately 2019 until two weeks before the Kabul airport attack. An ISIS-K suicide bomber named Abdul Rahman al-Logari — who had been freed by the Taliban from a prison at Bagram Air Base in mid-August 2021, mere weeks after the U.S. abandoned the base — has been identified as having carried out the suicide attack at Abbey Gate. The FBI said Sharifullah recognized Logari as an ISIS-K operative he had known while in prison.\n\nLead-up to the Kabul airport attack\n\nThe FBI said Sharifullah was contacted by another ISIS-K member upon being freed from prison in mid-August 2021 who linked Sharifullah up with the ISIS-K plot to attack U.S. forces at Hamid Karzai International Airport. The bureau said ISIS-K members provided Sharifullah with a motorcycle, funds for a cell phone, and instructions on using social media to communicate with them in the lead-up to the attack.\n\nSharifullah said he “was tasked with scouting a route near HKIA for an attacker,” the FBI said, and Sharifullah “conducted surveillance on a route, specifically checking for law enforcement and American or Taliban checkpoints.” The terrorist told his ISIS-K associates that the route seemed clear and that he didn’t believe Logari would be detected when approaching HKIA.\n\nThe Abbey Gate attack killed eleven Marines, one Army soldier, one Navy corpsman, and an estimated 170 Afghan civilians, while wounding dozens of other U.S. troops and scores of Afghans in the crowd, on August 26, 2021.\n\nPatel: \"The FBI will never forget\"\n\nGold Star family members of the fallen U.S. soldiers pleaded with the Biden administration for more answers about the attack, Fox News reported, including during a roundtable before the House Foreign Affairs Committee in 2023, where the Biden White House sought to place the blame for the debacle on the first Trump Administration.\n\nEarlier this year, the family members condemned the Biden administration for doing \"nothing but attempt to take victory laps and thumb their noses at the sacrifice our children made on that fateful day,\" and the families called upon the Trump administration to pursue answers. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said last week that \"we’re taking a very different view obviously than the previous [Biden] administration — and there will be full accountability.\"\n\nSharifullah has been charged with providing material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization resulting in death, and he faces a potential life sentence. FBI Director Kash Patel vowed that “the FBI will never forget the loss of these American heroes, we will continue to hunt down those who viciously murdered our warriors, we will find all responsible and bring them to justice.” Attorney General Pam Bondi said that “under President Trump’s strong leadership on the world stage, this Department of Justice will ensure that terrorists like Mohammad Sharifullah have no safe haven.”\n\nAnd CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Wednesday that “my second day on the job, I spoke with the head of Pakistani intelligence. I shared with him intelligence we had indicating that Jafar was located in the Afghan-Pakistan border region.”\n\nThen-President Joe Biden announced the unconditional withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in an April 2021 speech, setting the withdrawal deadline for the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attack. The Taliban conducted a rapid takeover of the country in the ensuing months and swept into the Afghan capital of Kabul on August 15, 2021. The chaotic and deadly non-combatant evacuation operation by the U.S. was conducted while the U.S. military relied upon a hostile Taliban to provide security outside the airport.\n\nTrump said Tuesday that \"we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity, and he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice.\"\n\nThe \"fake mastermind\"\n\nSarah Adams, a writer and an alum of the CIA who has investigated the Abbey Gate attack, argued on X that Trump was being misled and that Sharifullah was a “fake mastermind.” She contended that the Abbey Gate attack instead “had two joint Masterminds” neither of which were Sharifullah. She said that Sirajuddin Haqqani, the current Taliban interior minister and the leader of the terrorist Haqqani Network, and Sanaullah Ghafari, believed to be a former mid-level Haqqani commander and the current leader of ISIS-K were the \"real\" masterminds.\n\nMastermind or not, the FBI said Sharifullah further confessed to playing a role in the March 2024 attack by ISIS-K against the Crocus City Hall near Moscow, Russia, which killed approximately 130 people. The Biden State Department said it had collected intelligence indicating that ISIS-K was planning an attack in Moscow and contended that it had warned the Kremlin about it.\n\nSharifullah said he received an order from an ISIS-K senior leader to teach would-be attackers in Moscow on how to use AK-style rifles. He added that he later recognized two of perpetrators as men to whom he had provided the online firearms training.\n\nDeath at the Canadian embassy\n\nThe FBI said Sharifullah also confessed to a role in facilitating a June 2016 suicide bombing attack which intended to target U.S. Embassy personnel in Kabul but which actually killed more than ten guards tasked with protecting the Canadian embassy. Sharifullah said he conducted surveillance ahead of that attack and transported the bomber, who he said was named \"Irfan,\" to the site of the attack.\n\nAt the time, that suicide bomber was widely reported to have been part of the Taliban, and the Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid had even touted the deadly bombing on then-Twitter, saying it was carried out “against the forces of aggression” in Afghanistan.\n\nThe UN sanctions monitoring team said in a May 2020 report published by Security Council Report that some of the attacks claimed by ISIS-K may have arisen via “tactical accommodation” with the Haqqani Network. The UN team also said that some countries noted that most ISIS-K attacks include “involvement, facilitation, or the provision of technical assistance” by the Haqqani Network. The UN team also said it had “viewed communication intercepts in the wake of attacks that were claimed by ISIS-K that were traceable to known members of the Haqqani Network.”\n\nOne UN member state said in June 2021 that Ghafari’s ongoing relationship with the Haqqanis provided ISIS-K with “key expertise and access to [attack] networks.” The UN team said that some attacks by ISIS-K may have been “joint ventures” with the Haqqanis.\n\nNeither the FBI nor any of the involved governmental agencies have been able to fully answer the many unanswered questions raised by lawmakers about the attacks and withdrawal, but Sharifullah may very well provide answers — if they can be relied upon — as his case moves through the judicial system.",

FEMA claimed it rescinded the funds over concerns a violent gang had taken over a city shelter.\n\nFEMA approved and awarded the funds during the final months of President Joe Biden’s administration but didn’t disburse them until after Trump took office, the city said.\n\nCity lawyers argued the Trump administration’s gang concerns were a “hastily-constructed facade” and that its real goal was to thwart implementation of the congressionally-authorized shelter funding program.\n\n“Defendants’ money-grab — after FEMA review, approval, and actual payment, without notice or process of any kind — was, simply put, lawless,” the city argued in its lawsuit.\n\nAttorney Emily Hall, representing the US Government, told the judge during an hour of oral arguments on Wednesday that the money would be available once the lawsuit is fully adjudicated, unless Congress revokes it.\n\nJoshua Rubin, a lawyer for the city, told Rearden that it came as “a real shock to us” when the money was taken back.\n\nHe said the money was provided to house individuals who FEMA had decided could be in the country.\n\nRubin said he knew it was an “extraordinary request at the outset of the case” to ask that the funds be immediately restored, “but these are extraordinary circumstances.” He said it was unconstitutional that the money was taken back when Congress had appropriated it.\n\nThe judge, though, said in an oral ruling that the city had cited “no irreparable harm to warrant extraordinary relief.”",

        "full_text": "In an unprecedented move to funnel more public tax dollars toward groups that oppose abortion, Republican lawmakers in Missouri are advancing a plan to allow residents to donate to pregnancy resource centers instead of paying any state income taxes.\n\nThe proposal would establish a 100% tax credit, up from 70%, and a $50,000 annual cap per taxpayer. The result: Nearly all Missouri households — except those with the highest incomes — could fully satisfy their state tax bill by redirecting their payment from the state to pregnancy centers.\n\nThe move comes four months after Missouri voters reversed one of the nation’s strictest abortion bans, and just as clinics have begun performing the procedure again after overcoming Republican obstacles.\n\nSupporters of the bill, which last month cleared a key legislative hurdle in the state House, say it gives taxpayers more control over where their tax dollars go and allows them to support organizations that help pregnant women and provide alternatives to abortion. Alissa Gross, CEO of Resource Health Services, which runs four pregnancy resource centers in the Kansas City area, told the committee in written testimony that tax credits have led to a surge in donations to her organization and that a 100% tax credit could bring in even more.\n\n“Our ability to impact more men and women for life as well as build healthy families has been substantial,” she said.\n\nCritics argue the state’s support for pregnancy resource centers, also known as crisis pregnancy centers, diverts tax revenue away from essential services such as health care and public education and becomes a funding stream for anti-abortion advocacy. They say many centers do little to actually help women; instead, they say they merely discourage women from getting abortions.\n\n“A 70 percent tax credit with no cap was excessive. A 100 percent tax credit is absurd,” Katie Baylie, a lawyer and reproductive rights advocate based in the Kansas City area, wrote in testimony submitted to the committee. “It is an insult to Missourians that our lawmakers are spending time even considering this bill.”\n\nExperts in tax policy and philanthropy said a dollar-for-dollar tax credit — for any purpose — is rare and could be much costlier for the state than intended, especially if pregnancy centers actively promote it.\n\nThere is a big psychological difference for donors between a 100% tax credit and a 70% credit, the experts said. At 70%, donors still have to pay some taxes, but at 100%, there is no reason to make a donation less than their tax liability.\n\n“I could imagine a possibility where there’s a big publicity campaign by these centers, or a viral campaign, and massive numbers of conservative Missourians decide to effectively defund state government in favor of these pregnancy resource centers,” said David Gamage, a professor of tax law and policy at the University of Missouri law school.\n\nHowever, expansion of tax credits clashes with another Republican push to eliminate Missouri’s income tax altogether. Two proposals to replace it with a higher sales tax recently advanced in the state Senate, although it was unclear whether they could pass. If Missouri were to abolish state income taxes, tax credits would become meaningless.\n\nThe bill represents one more expansion of a measure Missouri lawmakers have been growing for several years. Until 2021, Missouri taxpayers who donated to pregnancy resource centers were able to claim a 50% tax credit for their donations, meaning for every $1,000 in donations, a taxpayer’s bill dropped by $500. That’s when an expansion approved by the legislature in 2019 took effect and raised the rate to 70%. That shifted more of the cost of those contributions to the state, since tax credits work by directly reducing the amount of money a taxpayer owes to the state. Unlike deductions, which lower taxable income, tax credits are a dollar-for-dollar reduction in tax liability. When these credits are redeemed, they prevent the state from collecting that revenue, effectively reducing the total income available for public services.\n\nThe legislature also removed a $3.5 million-per-year cap on the program and removed its expiration date.\n\nAt the time, the change drew little attention because it was tucked into the same legislation that created Missouri’s trigger law to ban abortion if Roe v. Wade were overturned — a move that dominated headlines. And there were few warnings about how much it could cost.\n\nThe bill’s official cost estimate, prepared by nonpartisan legislative oversight staff, projected only a modest increase in taxpayer expense. Raising the tax credit to 70% was expected to increase annual tax credits from $3.5 million to $4.9 million. That estimate assumed donations would remain steady.\n\nBut they didn’t. The program has grown significantly, with $11.8 million in tax credits authorized in the past year alone. Still, it remains a small fraction of Missouri’s overall budget; Gov. Mike Kehoe has proposed a $54 billion spending plan for next year.\n\nOnce again, legislative research is downplaying the potential impact on Missouri’s budget. The fiscal note for the bill accounts only for the jump from a 70% to a 100% tax credit, without considering the likely surge in donations that such an incentive would trigger — even though increasing giving is the entire point of the policy.\n\nThe note says that it was “unclear” whether the enhanced tax credit would encourage more people to contribute and claim the credit, which would lead to more foregone tax revenue for the state.\n\nThe legislative research staffer who authored the impact statement declined to comment, and the bill’s House sponsor, Rep. Christopher Warwick, did not respond to questions from ProPublica.\n\nWarwick, a Republican from Bolivar, in southwest Missouri, told the tax reform committee that his proposal empowers taxpayers to support important work without the state “trying to verify what programs work.” He said, too, that he would oppose requirements for pregnancy resource centers to report how they spend the money, saying he wanted to “limit the bureaucracy.”\n\nWarwick’s bill would also increase the tax credit for donations to maternity homes from 70% to 100% and for diaper banks from 50% to 100%. The state has not yet studied the impact of those changes.\n\nA matching bill has been introduced in the Senate but has not yet advanced.\n\nRep. Steve Butz, a Democrat from St. Louis, argued the tax credit would effectively shift charitable giving from individuals to the state.\n\n“This will be the fourth bill I’ve heard that will reduce revenue, which I guess is clearly your goal here — to reduce the revenue to the state,” Butz told Warwick during a legislative hearing on the bill. He argued that if donors receive a full tax credit for their contributions, they aren’t really giving their own money — rather, the state is effectively making the donation for them. “So I don’t know that I’d consider that much charitable giving.”\n\nIn an interview, Butz said he considers himself pro-life and has donated to pregnancy resource centers, receiving the 70% tax credit. However, he said he does not believe the program should take priority over others that receive less or no tax incentives for giving.\n\nMissouri’s approach to crisis pregnancy centers reflects a growing divide between red and blue states. While Republican-led states such as Florida, Texas and Tennessee have ramped up funding for pregnancy resource centers, states led by Democrats, including Massachusetts and California, have warned residents the centers mislead patients by posing as medical clinics while steering them away from abortion.\n\nMissouri is among the national leaders in per capita spending on pregnancy resource centers even before tax credits are factored in, according to data from states that fund them. Kehoe has proposed increasing direct state funding by almost 50% to more than $12 million in the fiscal year that starts July 1.\n\nIn a statement, Gabby Picard, communications director in Kehoe’s office, said the governor “is committed to supporting services that help women choose to carry their unborn child to term, which is why his budget recommends increased funding” for abortion alternatives, including pregnancy resource centers.\n\nMissouri was the first state to use tax credits to fund pregnancy centers, becoming a model for other states looking to support the anti-abortion movement. One public health expert who has tracked the impact of pregnancy centers said Missouri has been a leader and innovator in this effort. “What Missouri is proposing really makes them an outlier at the top of the game,” said Andrea Swartzendruber, an associate professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Georgia.\n\nWarwick’s initiative follows sweeping changes to Missouri’s abortion laws.\n\nIn November, voters approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to abortion and other reproductive health decisions, effectively nullifying a near-total ban that had been in place since 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe first abortion performed under the new amendment took place in Kansas City on Feb. 15, after a judge struck down restrictive licensing rules that had prevented providers like Planned Parenthood from resuming services in the state.\n\nIn response, Republican lawmakers have introduced a wave of bills aimed at limiting the amendment’s impact. Among the measures is another proposed constitutional amendment that would restrict abortion and ban gender-affirming care for minors — an effort to combine something that voters support with something they don’t in the hopes it’ll turn off abortion-rights supporters.\n\nSome abortion-rights advocates in the legislature see the expanded tax credit as part of a broader push by anti-abortion lawmakers stung by the repeal of the abortion ban. After the amendment passed, those legislators “needed some wins,” said Rep. Kemp Strickler, a Democrat from the Kansas City suburbs.\n\n“But even if the amendment had lost,” Strickler said, “they probably would have been coming forward with these kinds of things.”",

        "full_text": "Er ... what? Whatever happened to \"we don't negotiate with terrorists\"?\n\nCheck that -- we've been negotiating with terrorists since the early 1980s in Lebanon. But this doesn't make a lot of sense even apart from that, if Axios' Barak Ravid has it correct, and he's usually reliable. At the same time that Donald Trump argues to flatten Gaza and eject every resident within it, he has also authorized direct talks with Hamas to end the war and return the hostages -- at least nominally cutting Israel out of the process:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Trump administration has been holding direct talks with Hamas over the release of U.S. hostages held in Gaza and the possibility of a broader deal to end the war, two sources with direct knowledge of the discussions tell Axios.\n\nWhy it matters: The talks — held by U.S. presidential envoy for hostage affairs Adam Boehler — are unprecedented. The U.S. had never before engaged directly with Hamas, which it designated a terrorist organization in 1997.\n\nBoehler has a broad range as part of that portfolio, and for obvious reasons. \"Hostage affairs\" will inevitably require some contact with non-state actors, especially in that part of the world. However, contact with Hamas is particularly toxic in the political sense and has been ever since Rob Malley got exposed for engaging Hamas prior to coming aboard Barack Obama's first presidential campaign. Given Trump's hawkish approach to the Gaza war up to now, it doesn't make a lot of sense in the first-blush sense.\n\nPerhaps Trump is playing for effect? A little 3D chess in the Middle East for the sake of our Abraham Accord partners? If so, maybe the purpose is to get Hamas to reject an offer direct from the Americans about the American hostage they hold:\n\nZoom in: The talks have focused in part on the release of U.S. hostages, which is within Boehler's remit as hostage envoy.\n\nBut they have also included discussions of a broader deal to release all remaining hostages and reach a long-term truce, the sources say. No deal has yet been reached.\n\nNo deal will ever be reached, because there is no deal to be had for a lasting peace with Hamas. They are not interested in lasting peace. They want to annihilate Israel, and will only offer taqqiya in the short term while plotting annihilation at the next possible opportunity. In the meantime, they use these kinds of diplomatic initiatives to split Israel from its allies in the West and stall for time. They know how to play 3D chess too:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHamas has been stalling for four days to prevent Israel from pushing it to extend a hostage deal. The initial phase of the ceasefire and hostage deal began in mid-January, a day before the inauguration of US President Donald Trump. That deal was successful and saw hostages released by Hamas. However, the deal ended on March 1, and since then, Hamas has demanded that Israel move to phase 2 of the ceasefire deal.\n\nIsrael’s leaders have opposed phase 2 since the ceasefire began. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other officials have rejected the idea of ending the war and leaving the Philadelphi corridor in southern Gaza. However, Israeli officials also are unclear on when and if they will return to fighting in Gaza. Hamas now believes its long-term strategy has been successful.\n\nHamas believes that it can stall for long enough and call Israel’s bluff about having the “gates of hell” open if Hamas doesn’t buckle. Hamas also believes the Trump administration will not let “hell break loose” in Gaza. Why is Hamas so optimistic? It believes that Israel doesn’t really want to return to fighting. It knows the Trump administration has told Israel that Jerusalem can do whatever it wants.\n\nIf they have direct contact with the Trump administration, they will interpret that as weakness rather than resolve. And in fact, it looks as though Hamas has already taken that message:\n\nHamas believes it will be able to keep long-term control of Gaza. It says it won’t hand over its weapons or give in to a new Egyptian-led proposal for Gaza. It also rejects Trump's idea of re-settling Gaza. Hamas believes Israel is bluffing about returning to war. It also knows that Israel doesn’t want the Palestinian Authority to run Gaza. Hamas knows that if there is a vacuum in Gaza, it will fill it as it has done for the last decades. ...\n\nWhy is Hamas not being flexible? It doesn’t feel pressured.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf they are engaging with the US side directly, no wonder.\n\nOn the other hand, Trump just told Egypt to pound sand on their Gaza-reset plan:\n\nThe White House has rejected an Arab plan for rebuilding the Gaza Strip, an early indication of the strength of President Trump’s commitment to positions he has staked out on contentious foreign-policy issues.\n\nArab governments have scrambled to come up with a plan after Trump laid out a proposal for the U.S. to take over the territory and redevelop it as an international destination after clearing out its Palestinian residents. The Arab proposal nodded to the president’s vision of a “Riviera of the Middle East,” calling for the eventual development of beachfront resorts.\n\nBut the White House shot down the proposal, saying the extent of the destruction in Gaza made keeping Palestinians in the enclave unworkable. Critics of the plan also said it failed to spell out how it would disarm Hamas, the U.S.-designated terrorist group that led the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks on Israel that left 1,200 dead and triggered the war.\n\nThe rejection makes clear that Trump won’t easily give up on an idea that has been criticized by governments around the world and surprised some of his aides and own party. It is also a sign of the challenges facing countries from Canada to Ukraine in trying to steer Trump to more palatable outcomes in disputes of their own.\n\nWhat sense can be made of this? The most cynical take is that Trump wants to take credit for ending wars, even if the wars actually don't end. That was the sotto voce message from Volodymyr Zelensky last week, for which he's now apologizing: Trump was only buying a cessation, after which the West would lose interest. Getting Hamas to release the rest of the hostages in exchange for a return to the status quo would certainly fit that assessment, especially when it comes to Hamas, which has violated every cease-fire it has ever signed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe more generous theory: Trump is offering a Godfather move, essentially making Hamas an offer it can't refuse -- in the hopes that it will. In the movies and the book, the line \"I'll make him an offer he can't refuse\" was a signal that all hell would break loose otherwise. If Hamas remains intransigent, Trump can then say, \"We tried, and now all hell will break loose.\" That would certainly accelerate matters towards his own Gaza reclamation plan and mark an end to the Doha Billionaire Boys Club that Obama allowed in his second term.\n\nWhich is it? It's hard to tell, perhaps by design. The fact that it's leaked out leads me to lean toward the more generous theory, as does Trump's flat rejection of the Egyptian plan. But even if that's the intent, getting on the dance floor to do the Hamas Hokey Pokey rarely works out well for anyone, and it encourages other groups to hike pressure for that level of engagement down the road. \"We don't negotiate with terrorists\" is still the best policy, even if no one's following it these days.\n\nUpdate: This suggests that the more generous theory was the correct choice:\n\n“Shalom Hamas” means Hello and Goodbye - You can choose. Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you. Only sick and twisted people keep bodies, and you are sick and twisted! I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job, not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don’t do as I say. I have just met with your former Hostages whose lives you have destroyed. This is your last warning! For the leadership, now is the time to leave Gaza, while you still have a chance. Also, to the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD! Make a SMART decision. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW, OR THERE WILL BE HELL TO PAY LATER!\n\nDONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds like the gloves may be coming off. Let's see if Hamas tries a little more Hokey Pokey.\n\nUpdate: I overlooked one other ultimatum -- that Hamas 'leadership' leave Gaza. Perhaps the rank and file terrorists will capitulate if the remaining leadership decides to go into exile, but it seems more likely that they would seize power themselves ... or get fragged by civilians who may want a future without Iran's proxy army as their tyrant overlords.\n\nUpdate: An important point from Duane:\n\nTrue enough. Either Hamas has to act, or Trump has to act now. His previous red line was given before he took office, so he had a small out if he wanted to use it. Not this time.",

        "full_text": "(NewsNation) — The mayors of four sanctuary cities appearing before the Republican-led Committee On Oversight and Government Reform on Wednesday could be risking the loss of billions in federal funding for what GOP leaders refer to as a lack of cooperation with federal immigration enforcement efforts.\n\nThe committee’s chairman, U.S. Rep. James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, maintained state and local governments that refuse to comply with immigration enforcement “should not receive a penny of federal funding.”\n\nThe threat to withhold funding from cities like Chicago, Denver, New York and Boston, the four cities whose mayors are appearing before the committee, has also been floated by President Donald Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan.\n\nHoman said the lack of cooperation puts Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at risk and puts local neighborhoods in those cities in danger.\n\n“Sanctuary cities want to keep locking us out of jails, (and) they force us into neighborhoods to find the bad guys,” Homan told reporters Tuesday. “Many times, they’re with others, others who aren’t a criminal priority but are in the country illegally; they’re coming too.”\n\nHow sanctuary cities could lose funding\n\nThe federal scrutiny of sanctuary cities has put Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, Denver Mayor Mike Johnston, New York Mayor Eric Adams and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu in the crosshairs.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has already sued the state of New York and the city of Chicago, alleging that the cities have obstructed the federal government from enforcing immigration laws. Shortly after Trump took office, the Department of Justice directed federal prosecutors to investigate whether local officials should face legal action for resisting federal immigration laws.\n\nBesides the two lawsuits, Bondi issued a memo in early February stating that sanctuary jurisdictions will not have access to federal funds from the DOJ.\n\nIn addition, Bondi stated that the DOJ would pause the distribution of all funds until a review could be completed and would terminate all agreements that violate the law.\n\nThe memo said sanctuary jurisdictions should not have access to DOJ federal grants. The memo also threatened to pause funding to nongovernmental organizations that “support and provide services to removable or illegal aliens.”\n\nAccording to the Center for Immigration Studies, the Department of Justice provided $1.56 billion in funding to sanctuary cities.\n\nChicago’s Johnson said having federal funding pulled would “undermine all of the investments we have made thus far.” He said that the city has spent more than $20 billion in new investments that contribute to the overall safety of Chicago.\n\nDenver’s mayor said that losing federal funding would “dramatically weaken public safety” and added it would keep the city from repairing broken-down bridges, enrolling kids in pre-school and providing medical care to veterans.\n\nIn addition, Trump’s transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, has threatened to move federal funding away from sanctuary cities. That could mean billions of dollars that could be withheld from those cities and states that have sanctuary policies in place that prohibit local police and law enforcement agencies from assisting with federal immigration enforcement.\n\nThe New York Times reported that the DOT sends billions of dollars to states and local governments each year for the funding of highways, public transit systems, airports, bridges and other projects.\n\nDespite the threats to strip sanctuary cities of federal funding, NewsNation political contributor Christopher Hahn said any funding withholding will likely lead to a lengthy legal battle that could reach the U.S. Supreme Court. Homan said that the disbursement of federal funding cannot be dependent on which political party is occupying the White House without Congress acting.\n\nHahn said before the hearing the four mayors should be ready to walk into what is expected to be a “very hostile” environment and defend the work their cities have done with the migrant community. He said that in each case, the mayors in each of the cities have committed to helping federal immigration officials deport dangerous criminals.\n\nBut rather than focus on what these cities are doing, Hahn said Republicans are focused on the “show business” aspect of Homan’s mass deportation efforts. He said it’s up to the mayors on Wednesday to ignore the hostility and stick to their gameplan of defending their cities.\n\n“(Republicans) have these ideas, and what’s happening is that their ideas are actually hurting the average American,” Hahn said. “Forget the immigrants. The average American is going to start to see increased prices on a lot of things and immigration is part of that.”\n\nFederal focus remains on sanctuary cities\n\nIn announcing Wednesday’s hearing with the four mayors, the Committee On Oversight and Government Reform included a nearly three-minute video on social media, targeting the four cities.\n\nIn a statement, Comer referred to those mayors as “pro-illegal alien mayors” and said all four have “implemented reckless, illegal policies that shield criminal aliens from federal immigration enforcement and endanger public safety.”\n\nIn response, Wu called the video “pretty dramatic” and said the video was “amusing to see so much effort going into hyping up the hearing. There are important topics we need to talk about.”\n\nOf the four mayors, only Adams has said that he would show cooperation with ICE and has signed an executive order allowing ICE agents to work on Rikers Island to help identify violent migrant criminals.\n\nIn announcing Wednesday’s hearing last month, Comer said that “President Trump and his administration are rightfully taking action against sanctuary cities.”\n\nComer previously said that “sanctuary mayors owe the American people an explanation for city policies that jeopardize public safety and violate federal immigration law” by releasing dangerous criminals into the streets.\n\nHoman has made previous visits to Chicago and New York, where highly publicized ICE raids took place. He also recently targeted Boston, saying he was “bringing hell with him” as his focus on noncooperative cities continues.\n\nDespite the two filed lawsuits and threats of having federal funding withheld, the mayors who will go before the congressional committee Wednesday remain committed to protecting their respective cities’ sanctuary status.\n\n“We are not going to be intimidated by those acts of terror that radically shift our way of living,” Johnson, Chicago’s mayor, told WTTW News. “That’s what individuals who stoke fear into people want to see happen.”\n\nTrump’s threats to go after officials who do not comply with federal immigration enforcement have also drawn the attention of migrant advocacy groups. Eskinder Negash, the president and CEO of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, said that “punitive measures” like the threats are counterproductive and unjust.\n\n“We should remain committed to advocating for policies that prioritize compassion and the shared prosperities of our communities,” Negash said.",

        "full_text": "After Elizabeth Holmes lost her last-ditch effort to overturn her 2022 fraud conviction by a federal appeals court on Monday, Feb. 24, the former Theranos founder responded to the decision from behind bars.\n\n“I am more determined than ever to fight for my freedom,\" Holmes says, writing via email from a federal prison in Texas. \"And I know that when the truth finally comes out I will be proven innocent.\"\n\nHolmes, who founded the billion-dollar blood testing company at the age of 19 in 2003, was convicted of three counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud over the collapse of her company. She was convicted alongside her former business and romantic partner Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani. The appeal of his conviction, which resulted in a prison sentence of 13 years, was also rejected in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in San Francisco the same day. The two are still ordered to pay $452 million in restitution.\n\nIn the opinion filed in court last week, three judges ruled that the issues Holmes raised about her trial — and the grounds on which she sought her sentence be overturned — were not valid. The ruling bookends a years-long Silicon Valley drama over the blood testing startup that took the industry by storm with Holmes’ appeal and $9 billion Theranos valuation. The company collapsed after its testing technology was exposed as a failure, a scandal that inspired books like journalist John Carreyrou's Bad Blood, the Hulu limited series The Dropout and podcasts.\n\nNow the 41-year-old mother of two small children, wears drab khaki prison garb, with her blonde hair pulled back, bare makeup and a silver cross around her neck— speaking in a voice notably softer than the throaty baritone she was known for.\n\n“I’m not the same person I was back then,” said Holmes in PEOPLE's February 2025 cover story, who pleaded not guilty at her trial and maintains her innocence today, albeit while vaguely acknowledging “there are things I would have done differently” on her path to lockup.\n\n“It’s surreal. People who have never met me believe so strongly about me. They don’t understand who I am. It forces you to spend a lot of time questioning belief and hoping the truth will prevail. I am walking by faith and, ultimately, the truth. But it’s been hell and torture to be here.”\n\nHolmes began serving her 11-year sentence (reduced to nine for good behavior) in May 2023 at Federal Prison Camp Bryan in Bryan, Texas. Her listed release date at the Federal Bureau of Prisons is currently March 19, 2032.\n\nHolmes asked the court to toss out her conviction and grant a new trial, arguing that prosecutors presented key testimony during the four-month trial from Theranos’ final lab director that was “infected with error.”\n\nProsecutors used the lab director, Kingshuk Das, as a scientific expert on Theranos’ blood testing device called the Edison, but Holmes’ attorneys argued that he was never properly vetted by the judge as an expert.\n\nThe Justice Department countered that Das wasn’t providing an expert opinion, but rather testifying about what he saw at the company while he worked there and relayed to his boss Holmes at the time. The judges' opinion held that the former employees spoke from their own experiences, and not as experts.\n\nWhile “some aspects of the testimonies veered into expert territory,” read part of the opinion, “any error was harmless.”\n\nThe judges also dismissed Holmes’ claims that a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services report, which was presented in court during trial, misled the jury. Holmes also claimed the district court violated her rights when they denied her access to cross-examine, but the opinion held that limiting that access was justifiable.\n\nNeama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor and attorney, told PEOPLE this denial likely dooms Holmes's chances of having her conviction reversed.\n\n\"This is likely the end of the road for Holmes. She gets one appeal as of right, and this was it,\" Rahmani said, adding that while there may be options for other appeals, \"only a small percentage\" of those result in even a hearing.\n\nAfter her appeal was denied, prosecutors declined to comment to PEOPLE. Her defense has not responded for comment.\n\nAs for Holmes, she's still processing the downfall that wiped away her entire fortune and she considers her trial and conviction in a San Jose courtroom in 2022 to be a miscarriage of justice.",

FROM SICARIO TO SIN NOMBRE TO THE MARKSMAN, ALL WITH VARYING DEGREES OF REALISM AND ACCURACY, ILLUSTRATING THE LONG RUNNING TENSIONS AT OUR SOUTHERN BORDER.\n\nOF COURSE YOU DON’T HAVE TO LOOK ANY FURTHER THAN TODAY’S HEADLINES FOR THE LATEST ON THIS DECADES OLD ISSUE. BUT NOW, WITH A NEW ADMINISTRATION IN THE WHITE HOUSE, THE POTENTIAL FOR SOMETHING WE’VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE EXISTS; REGULAR AMERICAN TROOPS GOING AFTER MEXICAN CARTELS. AND THAT’S THE SUBJECT OF THIS WEEK’S DEBRIEF.\n\nONE OF THE MANY EXECUTIVE ORDERS SIGNED BY PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP SINCE RETAKING THE OVAL OFFICE CALLED FOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO LABEL MEXICAN DRUG CARTELS AS FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS–FTOs.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT IS MOTIVATED BY THE RISE IN OPIOID AND FENTANYL RELATED DEATHS LARGELY ATTRIBUTED TO THE CARTELS’ SMUGGLING OPERATIONS.\n\nSECRETARY OF STATE MARCO RUBIO DID LABEL 8 MEXICAN CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS–INCLUDING THE TREN DE ARAGUA GANG AND THE SINOLA CARTEL– AS FTOs AFTER THE DEPARTMENT’S BUREAU OF COUNTERTERRORISM SHOWED THE GROUPS WERE ENGAGING IN TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, WHICH ARE DEFINED AS PREMEDITATED, POLITICALLY MOTIVATED VIOLENCE PERPETRATED AGAINST NONCOMBATANT TARGETS BY SUBNATIONAL OR CLANDESTINE GROUPS.\n\nBUT JUST BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES NOW OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZES THE CARTELS AS TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS–DOESN’T MEAN A FULL-SCALE U-S INVASION TO ROOT OUT MEXICAN CARTELS IS GOING TO HAPPEN.\n\n[Jon Molik, Army Intelligence Officer]\n\n“Yeah, I think it was really the message that was most important when it came to targeting or labeling these cartels FTOs.”\n\n[Ryan Robertson]\n\nJON MOLIK IS AN ACTIVE-DUTY U-S INTELLIGENCE OFFICER.\n\n[Jon Molik, Army Intelligence Officer]\n\n“I mean, they’re already targeted with some pretty significant law enforcement authority. The Drug Enforcement Administration works very hard on the border and in other places to curb the drug smuggling from said cartels and Homeland Security Investigations does as well, the FBI. You know, there are already a lot of laws on the books dealing with what are traditionally called transnational criminal organizations, TCOs. And so there’s a bit of an increase in financial authority, financial investigative authority. You can seize some real estate property. can seize financial assets and stuff. And you can break financial transactions between US citizens and those cartels. But there isn’t a huge leap, if you will. It’s more about messaging.”\n\n[Ryan Robertson, host of Weapons and Warfare]\n\n“If we take those gloves off and this becomes a kinetic fight, you know, let’s push things out to the right. What would that look like? Is it SOF units? Is it HIMARS on the Rio Grande? What, what would a kinetic fight with the cartels look like?”\n\n[Jon Molik, Army Intelligence Officer]\n\n“Yeah. So again, assuming the diplomatic efforts fall through and this ends up being something that is kinetic. I would say it’s not the latter, more the former in that being special operations activity, you know, south of the border. if we wanted to get involved in that. But I would say that’s something that already kind of happens in a law enforcement capacity. So I think it would be more of that. it would look a lot like, in my estimation, it would look a lot like what we do with foreign governments across the world that are allies with the United States, and that is training and bolstering and equipping those that are already there. So, and that’s really the ultimate purpose of special operations forces, at least some of the groups, is to train other militaries. That’s what the Green Berets do in particular.”\n\n[Ryan Robertson]\n\nGREEN BERETS LIKE ERIC BROWN–WHO SPENT MORE THAN 20 YEARS WITH THE ARMY’S SPECIAL FORCES.\n\n[Eric Brown, Former Green Beret]\n\n“You don’t wanna solve a problem for another country. You wanna give the resources and capabilities to that country for them to solve that problem.”\n\n[Ryan Robertson]\n\nBROWN SAYS IF THE CARTELS DO FIND THEIR WAY ONTO THE U-S STATE DEPARTMENT’S FTO LIST–THEN NEW POTS OF MONEY ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO CARRYOUT AND EXPAND OPERATIONS.\n\nSO, MORE INTELLIGENCE GATHERING, MORE TRAINING OF LOCAL FORCES, MAYBE SOME ELITE U-S SOLDIERS ON THE GROUND CARRYING-OUT HIGH VALUE MISSIONS. BUT BOTH BROWN AND MOLIK SAY A FULL ON, HEAD-TO-HEAD FIGHT BETWEEN THE CARTELS AND CONVENTIONAL U-S FORCES IS NOT REALISTIC.\n\n[Eric Brown, Former Green Beret]\n\n“I don’t think they have close air support capabilities yet. I don’t think they have F-35s and F-16s and C-130, you know, Spectre gunships, gunships dropping bombs. I could be wrong, but I mean, they do have the ability to do that with drones of dropping ordnance. But yeah, I think it’d be more of a clandestine approach.”\n\n[Ryan Robertson, host of Weapons and Warfare]\n\n“Right? Because pulling in like, you know, those more exquisite assets like a, you know, a ghostrider gunship or something like that, obviously, that would take a lot of coordination with the Mexican government as well. And like you said, the stomach for that. I mean, there could be–that would be a full scale war. There are going to be casualties and you know, impacts of that kind of operation. So, yeah, I think, you know, obviously I’m going to agree with you. You’re the expert, right? I think it probably would be more clandestine type approaches, but walk me through what that would look like. I mean, it’s, you know, special forces going in, teaching native populations, you know, how to, how to conduct warfare, but there’s also probably going to be some smaller squads, you know, doing some ninja type stuff in the middle of the night, right?”\n\n[Eric Brown, Former Green Beret]\n\n“Yeah, I like that analogy. Ninja squads. You better watch out, somebody in the government might take that and name a ninja squad. Yeah, if you’re training, let’s say, an elite force with the Mexican military to go head on and hit those strategic targets. But if you do have, let’s say, what we did in Afghanistan and Iraq, right, was the HVT, a high value target, that you can get permissions and authorities to do a kill-capture mission. That’s when you would bring in the force that does that for the America side, where you gain that intelligence, you infiltrate you know, clandestinely at night or whatever the time that they’re not expecting it and you come off the truck or the air, you know, air platform and you execute a target and then fly back, either killing or capturing. But like you said, you have to have the, you know, that’s when America and Mexico have to high five and, and agree on that because, no one wants our ninjas to come into their country, cause they’re sovereign, right? We wouldn’t want Mexico to have a ninja squad to come into America to execute what they deem a high value target.”\n\n[Ryan Robertson]\n\nAPART FROM NINJA SQUADS CARRYING OUT CLANDESTINE MISSIONS ON HIGH VALUE TARGETS–BROWN SAYS THE U-S COULD DECIDE TO USE DRONES, LIKE AN MQ-9 REAPER–TO TAKE OUT CERTAIN CARTEL MEMBERS–SORT OF LIKE HOW TRUMP ORDERED THE STRIKE ON QASSEM SOLEMIENI–AN IRANIAN TERRORIST LEADER WHO WAS BLOWN UP WHILE IN IRAQ.\n\n[Eric Brown, Former Green Beret]\n\n“When we did that to him, I mean, Iraq got mad, but nothing happened.”\n\n[Ryan Robertson]\n\nWHEN IT COMES TO USING REAPERS TO TAKE OUT DRUG FACTORIES THOUGH, MOLIK SAYS THE JUICE MAY NOT BE WORTH THE SQUEEZE.\n\n[Jon Molik, Army Intelligence Officer]\n\n“In terms of kinetic response; using platforms like the Reaper, which has that capability, that’s all about tactics. What I mean by that is to say, how effective would it be to conduct targeted strikes against, say, drug labs that are being operated within one cartel? It’s likely going to be just as effective as going after IED locations, facilitation locations within Afghanistan. I mean, it would have an immediate impact and then someone’s gonna build a new drug house and it’s gonna move down the road and go somewhere else. So I don’t know if the United States would be interested in getting involved in some whack-a-mole with all of these, yeah, all of these MQ9s in their kinetic capacity. That costs a lot of money and how effective could it really be?”\n\n[Ryan Robertson]\n\nINFILTRATING THE CARTELS AND TAKING OUT THE WHOLE OPERATION SO IT CAN’T RECONSTITUTE WOULD BE ONE WAY OF DEALING WITH THE CARTELS…BUT PROTECTING THE IDENTITIES OF ANY AMERICAN’S INVOLVED IN THOSE OPERATIONS WOULD BE VITAL. BECAUSE UNLIKE FIGHTING THE TALIBAN OR ISIS, THERE IS A REAL RISK OF RETALIATION FROM THE CARTELS AGAINST SOLDIERS’ FAMILIES. THE CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE OBVIOUSLY VERY WELL FUNDED AND OPERATE VAST NETWORKS–SO IF A SOLDIER’S IDENTITY IS DISCOVERED, THE CARTELS ABSOLUTELY HAVE THE MEANS TO ACT ON THAT INFORMATION.\n\nBUT THERE AGAIN, DOING SO MAY ACTUALLY PUT THE CARTELS IN A MORE PRECARIOUS POSITION WITH THE U-S MILITARY THAN THEY ALREADY ARE.\n\n[Jon Molik, Army Intelligence Officer]\n\n“The cartels are a little different than other organizations we’ve dealt with throughout the world. Other organizations are looking at potentially becoming nation states, taking control of land from other areas. And that’s not what the cartels want. The cartels are like gangs and organized crime in the United States. They want to make money. And the only way to make money is if nobody is paying attention to them. And so if they conducted some type of operation so drastic, like killing innocents with RPGs across the border, you’re going to bring the full-fledged might of the United States potentially against your operations. And now you can’t make money.”\n\n[Ryan Robertson]\n\nSO, TO RECAP–WHILE LABELING MEXICAN DRUG CARTELS AS FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS DOES PUT THEM IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS HAMAS, ISIS, AND BOKO HARAM… IT DOESN’T MEAN THE U-S WILL FIGHT THEM THE SAME WAY.\n\nIT DOES MEAN THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE IS PUTTING A LOT MORE SCRUTINY ON THOSE ORGANIZATIONS AND IS WILLING TO PUT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TOWARDS TAKING THEM DOWN.",

        "full_text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is granting a one-month exemption on his stiff new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers, as worries persist that the newly launched trade war could crush domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe pause comes after Trump spoke with leaders of the “big 3” automakers, Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, on Wednesday, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.\n\nAsked if 30 days was enough for the auto sector to prepare for the new taxes, Leavitt said Trump was blunt with the automakers seeking an exemption: “He told them that they should get on it, start investing, start moving, shift production here to the United States of America where they will pay no tariff.”\n\nTrump had long promised to impose tariffs, but his opening weeks in the White House involved aggressive threats and surprise suspensions, leaving allies unclear at what the U.S. president is actually trying to achieve.\n\nBased off various Trump administration statements, the tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China imposed on Tuesday are about stopping illegal immigration, blocking fentanyl smuggling, closing the trade gap, balancing the federal budget and other nations showing more respect for Trump.\n\nAll of that has left Canada, a long-standing ally, determined to stand up against Trump with their own retaliatory tariffs, rejecting a White House overture to possibly reduce some of tariffs imposed on Tuesday.\n\n“We are not going to back down,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford said after speaking with the Canadian prime minister. “We will not budge. Zero tariffs and that is it”\n\nFord told The Associated Press that the auto sector in the United States and Canada would last approximately 10 days before they start shutting down the assembly lines because of the tariffs.\n\n“People are going to lose their jobs,” he said.\n\nAfter the White House announced the one month reprieve, shares of big U.S., Asian and European automakers jumped as much as 6%.\n\nBut pausing the 25% taxes on autos and auto parts traded through the North American trade pact USMCA would only delay a broader reckoning to take place on April 2, when Trump is set to impose broad “reciprocal” tariffs to match the taxes and subsidies that other countries charge on imports.\n\nThe U.S. automaker Ford said in a statement: “We will continue to have a healthy and candid dialogue with the Administration to help achieve a bright future for our industry and U.S. manufacturing.”\n\nGM in a statement thanked Trump “for his approach, which enables American automakers like GM to compete and invest domestically.”\n\nStellantis also thanked Trump for the one-month exemption, saying it “strongly” supported “his determination to enable the American automotive sector to thrive.”\n\nOther industries are also likely to seek exemptions from the import taxes.\n\n“A number of industries have reached out to us to ask us for exemptions to the tariffs,” Vice President JD Vance said Wednesday.\n\nThe White House repeatedly insisted that it would not grant exemptions and the sudden turnaround reflects the economic and political problems being created by Trump’s day-old tariffs. While the Republican president sees them as enriching the United States, his plans to tax imports have alienated allies and caused anxiety about slower economic growth and accelerating inflation.\n\nThe U.S. president engaged in a phone call on Wednesday with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, as U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had suggested that the administration was looking to meet Canada and Mexico “in the middle.”\n\nBut Trudeau refused to lift Canada’s retaliatory tariffs so long as Trump continues with his new taxes on imports from Canada, a senior government official told The Associated Press. The official confirmed the stance on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.\n\n“Both countries will continue to be in contact today,” Trudeau’s office said.\n\nThe prospect of a trade war appears to be an ongoing feature of the Trump administration. In addition to his upcoming reciprocal tariffs that could strike the European Union, India, Brazil, South Korea, Canada and Mexico, Trump wants to tax imports of computer chips, pharmaceutical drugs and autos. He also closed exemptions on his 2018 steel and aluminum tariffs and is investigating tariffs on copper as well.\n\nTariffs are taxes paid by importers in the countries receiving the goods, so the cost could largely be passed along to U.S. consumers and businesses in the form of higher prices. In his Tuesday night speech to a joint session of Congress, Trump tried to minimize the financial pain as a “ little disturbance.”\n\n“It may be a little bit of an adjustment period,” he said after claiming that farmers would benefit from reciprocal tariffs on countries that have tariffs on U.S. exports. “You have to bear with me again and this will be even better.”\n\nTrump has predicted that tariffs will lead to greater investment inside the U.S., creating factory jobs and boosting growth in the long term.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump put 25% taxes on imports from Mexico and Canada, taxing Canadian energy products such as oil and electricity at a lower 10% rate. The president also doubled the 10% tariff he placed on China to 20%.\n\nThe administration has claimed that the tariffs are about stopping the smuggling of drugs such as fentanyl, with aides asserting that this is about a “drug war” rather than a “trade war.” U.S. customs agents seized just 43 pounds (19.5 kilograms) of fentanyl at the northern border the last fiscal year.\n\nTrudeau said on Tuesday that his country would plaster tariffs on over $100 billion (U.S. dollars) of American goods over the course of 21 days, stressing that the United States had abandoned a long-standing friendship.\n\n“Today, the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same time, they are talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying, murderous dictator. Make that make sense,” Trudeau said on Tuesday.\n\nMexico indicated it would announce its own countermeasures on Sunday.\n\nBeijing responded with tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of U.S. farm exports. It also expanded the number of U.S. companies subject to export controls and other restrictions by about two dozen.\n\n“If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end,” China’s embassy to the United States posted on X on Tuesday night.\n\nIn response to China, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends” that the United States is “prepared” for war against the world’s second largest economy.\n\n“Those who long for peace must prepare for war,” Hegseth said Wednesday morning. “If we want to deter war with the Chinese or others, we have to be strong.”\n\nLeavitt is one of three administration officials who face a lawsuit from The Associated Press on First- and Fifth-amendment grounds. The AP says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Alexa St. John in Detroit contributed reporting.

        "full_text": "The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5–4 on March 4 that the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) wastewater discharge permitting system violates federal law.\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett wrote a dissenting opinion that was joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nThe nation’s highest court ruled that the EPA must provide specific effluent limitations to wastewater facilities and the governmental bodies that operate them. Effluent is liquid waste or sewage released into a sea or river.\n\nSan Francisco argued in the appeal that the EPA imposed overly vague limitations on how much pollution may be present in wastewater discharged by water utilities. The city stated that the regulations made it difficult to know if its wastewater systems were in compliance.\n\nThe EPA grants permits to local governments and water management authorities under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) to limit the amount of pollution flowing into bodies of water.\n\nIn court documents, San Francisco stated that the EPA directs cities not to pollute water bodies “too much” but does not provide a specific limitation, and this opens the door to uncertainty and makes it hard to comply.\n\nInstead of telling the city “how much it needs to control its discharges to comply with the Act,” the EPA’s “generic prohibitions leave the City vulnerable to enforcement based on whether the Pacific Ocean meets state-adopted water quality standards,” according to the city.\n\nSan Francisco argued that it was unfair to hold it responsible for polluted Pacific Ocean beaches near the city because the pollution may have come from outside sources.\n\nThe EPA stated that the city’s wastewater system cannot cope with runoff during storms, leading to pollution being released into the ocean.\n\nThe city stated that it was facing potentially billions of dollars in fines for violating its permit.\n\nAfter San Francisco challenged the permit, the EPA’s Environmental Appeals Board rejected the challenge in December 2020.\n\nIn July 2023, a divided U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected San Francisco’s appeal and affirmed the EPA’s power to specify “general narrative prohibitions” on discharges under the Clean Water Act (CWA).\n\nUnder the Clean Water Act, the agency may issue limitations when it is uncertain that the effluent limitations in the permit are adequate to protect water quality, he said.\n\nIn the majority opinion, Alito wrote that “‘end-result’ requirements” in permits “make a permittee responsible for the quality of the water in the body of water into which the permittee discharges pollutants.”\n\n“When a permit contains such requirements, a permittee that punctiliously follows every specific requirement in its permit may nevertheless face crushing penalties if the quality of the water in its receiving waters falls below the applicable standards,” he wrote.\n\nHowever, the effluent-limiting provisions of the Clean Water Act do not allow the EPA “to include ‘end-result’ provisions in NPDES permits.”\n\n“Determining what steps a permittee must take to ensure that water quality standards are met is the EPA’s responsibility, and Congress has given it the tools needed to make that determination. If the EPA does what the CWA demands, water quality will not suffer,” Alito wrote.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the ruling of the Ninth Circuit.\n\nBarrett, who dissented in part, wrote in her opinion that San Francisco’s argument that the EPA lacks statutory authority to impose conditions on the discharge of pollutants into the ocean is “wrong.”\n\nThe Clean Water Act requires the EPA “to impose ‘any more stringent limitation’ that is ‘necessary to meet ... or required to implement any applicable water quality standard.’”\n\n“Conditions that forbid the city to violate water quality standards are plainly ‘limitations’ on the city’s license to discharge,” Barrett wrote.\n\nThe new ruling is the EPA’s fourth loss at the Supreme Court since 2022.",

        "full_text": "While the internet has made accessing information and updates on what is happening in the world extremely easy, it has also facilitated the proliferation of fake news. Over the past decades, fake news has thus become a heated topic of debate, with some social media platforms introducing measures aimed at curbing online misinformation.\n\nResearchers at PSL University and University of Zurich recently set out to investigate people's ability to correctly identify both true and false news, by reviewing previous psychology and behavioral science studies. The findings of their meta-analysis, published in Nature Human Behavior, suggest that most people are good at identifying fake news, while a good portion of people tend to be skeptical of news that is true.\n\n\"In May 2021, Jan Pfänder, who led the study, took a course on meta-analysis and wanted to do a meta-analysis on news judgment,\" Sacha Altay, senior author of the paper, told Medical Xpress.\n\n\"At the time, I found the idea interesting but didn't see much potential. A year later, in light of academic debates about whether skepticism towards true news is a greater issue than gullibility towards false news, I saw an angle: the data Jan started collecting could not only tell us whether people can tell true from false news, but also whether people are more skeptical of true news than they are gullible of false news.\"\n\nWhen Altay and Pfänder first started conducting their meta-analysis, they observed that many past studies gathered evidence suggesting that people are quite good at distinguishing between true and false news, with the rejection of true news being more common than the acceptance of false news. Nonetheless, many academics were not convinced by these findings and public discourse continued to emphasize people's misinformation.\n\n\"We thus decided to systematically investigate these apparent trends to establish whether they are real or not, and whether they could be caused by some methodological artifacts, such as the type of scales used to measure the accuracy of the news or the news selection process itself,\" explained Altay.\n\n\"We conducted a systematic literature review and a pre-registered meta-analysis of all the experiments exposing people to true and false news and asking them to rate the accuracy of the news.\"\n\nAltay and Pfänder reviewed several past studies, which included a total of 194,438 participants based in 40 different countries across six continents. The findings of their meta-analysis appeared to confirm earlier results, suggesting that people are very good at discerning between true and false news.\n\n\"A large majority of people (~80%) can discern true from false news,\" said Altay. \"The implication is that crowdsourced fact-checking initiatives have a lot of potential: we should find ways to harness collective intelligence when it comes to rating the quality of information online.\"\n\nWhile their findings suggest that most people can accurately judge the veracity of news, they also showed that people are slightly better at spotting false news than true news. In other words, most of the people who took part in the studies appeared to be better skilled at rating false news as false than rating true news as true.\n\n\"A small majority of people show this trend (59%),\" said Altay. \"The implication of this finding is that we should focus more on increasing the acceptance of true news. Currently, a lot of efforts are dedicated to making people skeptical of (false) news, however, our data shows that there may be more room to increase the acceptance of true news than to reduce the acceptance of false news.\"\n\nThe recent meta-analysis run by Altay and Pfänder aligns with previous findings, thus suggesting that people are better at identifying false news than public opinion might think. The researchers are now planning to carry out further studies to assess the potential of various strategies for improving people's ability to tell false and true news apart.\n\n\"As part of our future research, we will do another meta-analysis, this time focusing on interventions aimed at improving people's ability to discern true from false news,\" added Altay. \"The goal is to measure how effective they are and under what conditions.\"\n\n© 2025 Science X Network",

        "full_text": "China has set an annual growth target of “about 5 percent”, promising to make domestic demand its main economic driver as an escalating trade war with the United States hit exports.\n\nThe headline growth figure announced by Premier Li Qiang at an annual Communist Party conclave on Wednesday also included a rare rise in fiscal funding, allowing China’s budget deficit to reach 4 percent this year as it battles stuttering employment for young people, low consumer demand and a property sector debt crisis.\n\nUnder the plans, some 12 million new jobs will be created in Chinese cities as Beijing pushes for 2 percent inflation this year.\n\n“Budget deficit ratio from 3 percent to 4 percent doesn’t seem much, but that’s the highest that has been set in three decades. So the government is committing to spending more,” Al Jazeera’s Katrina Yu said, reporting from Beijing.\n\nThe Chinese government also pledged to make domestic demand the “main engine and anchor” of growth, adding that Beijing should “move faster to address inadequate domestic demand, particularly insufficient consumption”.\n\nIn a rare move, Li said China would hike its fiscal deficit by one percentage point, something that analysts have said will give Beijing more latitude to tackle its economic slowdown.\n\nAddressing nearly 3,000 members of the National People’s Congress, Li in his 55-minute talk acknowledged both international and domestic challenges.\n\n“An increasingly complex and severe external environment may exert a greater impact on China in areas such as trade, science, and technology,” the 32-page report said.\n\n“Domestically, the foundation for China’s sustained economic recovery and growth is not strong enough. Effective demand is weak, and consumption, in particular, is sluggish.”\n\nDefence budget hiked\n\nChina also said in a draft budget that defence spending would rise 7.2 percent this year as it rapidly modernises its armed forces in the face of regional tensions and strategic competition with the US.\n\nSince Xi Jinping became president and commander-in-chief more than a decade ago, China’s defence budget has ballooned to 1.78 trillion yuan ($245bn) this year from 720 billion yuan in 2013.\n\n“President Xi Jinping has made it very clear that he wants to modernise China’s military by the year 2035 and a lot of that money will go towards military technology, better missiles, better submarines and missile surveillance technology,” Al Jazeera’s Katrina Yu said.\n\nAt the same time, the Chinese military is trying to improve combat readiness through more rigorous training and drills, according to official reports – many of which involve Taiwan scenarios and territorial claims in the South China Sea.\n\nBeijing considers Taiwan part of its territory, but the Pacific island has had an independent government since 1949. Xi has repeatedly said he does not want to postpone unification indefinitely – and would use force, if necessary.\n\nChina remains the world’s second-largest military spender behind the US, whose proposed military budget for 2025 is $850bn.",

        "full_text": "The Palm Beach Post fired its editorial page editor after the Florida paper ran a cartoon on the war in Gaza that local Jewish groups slammed as antisemitic.\n\nTony Doris, 67, who worked at the Gannett-owned broadsheet for more than 20 years, was let go last month following the backlash.\n\nThe syndicated cartoon ran in January and showed two Israeli soldiers rescuing a hostage held captive by Hamas with the caption: “Some Israeli Hostages Are Home After Over a Year of Merciless War.”\n\nThe soldiers tell the hostage “watch your step” as the three figures walk over a pile of bodies with the label “over 40 thousand Palestinians killed.”\n\nDoris, who is Jewish, claimed the illustration was simply anti-war.\n\n“I fully support Israel’s right to exist,” Doris told Stet News, a nonprofit news group in Palm Beach that earlier reported his firing.\n\n“I think you can feel that way and still be open to discussion of the issue of violence that has taken place there.”\n\nGannett declined to comment on Doris’ ouster.\n\n“The cartoon did not meet our standards,” Lark-Marie Anton, a Palm Beach Post spokesperson, told The Post in a statement. “We sincerely regret the error and have taken appropriate action to prevent this from happening again.”\n\nThe cartoon immediately stirred controversy in the posh community, leading the Jewish Federation of Palm Beach County to buy a full-page ad in the following week’s Sunday Palm Beach Post denouncing the decision.\n\nIn the ad, the nonprofit argued the cartoon trivialized hostages’ suffering and “spread dangerous antisemitic tropes, including the false and inflammatory accusation of bloodlust.”\n\nSenior editors at Gannett took action after the ad ran — suspending Doris and meeting with leaders from the federation, including president and chief executive Michael Hoffman.\n\nDuring the meeting, the Gannett editors apologized for running the cartoon and discussed ways to promote healthy dialogue around issues important to the area’s big Jewish community, Hoffman told the New York Times.\n\nA week later, Doris said a senior editor fired him for violating company policy, though the editor did not specify which policy he breached.\n\nDoris said he was not paid any severance.\n\n“I think it speaks to a misunderstanding or failure to engage with the mission of an editorial page,” he told the Times.\n\nJeff Danziger, the political cartoonist behind the image that stoked uproar, has penned several anti-war drawings throughout his career.\n\nHe told the Times the cartoon was not antisemitic, but “simply a case of, ‘This war’s gone on long enough.'”\n\n“I’m a Vietnam veteran, and I think that I know what I’m talking about — at least from the standpoint of war being bad,” said Danziger, who served as an intelligence officer in the Army and has a Jewish father.",

        "full_text": "A coalition of 21 Democratic attorneys general sued Thursday to block the Trump administration from gutting the Department of Education, arguing that Congress created the Cabinet-level agency and only Congress may abolish it.\n\nThe lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts came two days after Education Secretary Linda McMahon announced that the department’s staff would be cut by about 2,183 employees for a 50% reduction in force.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James called the staffing cuts “reckless and illegal.”\n\n“Today I am taking action to stop the madness and protect our schools and the students who depend on them,” she said in a Thursday press release.\n\nPresident Trump campaigned on a promise to eliminate the department, calling it “a big con job.” The attorneys general accused him of exceeding his authority.\n\n“The Department is an executive agency authorized by Congress, with numerous different laws creating its various programs and funding streams,” said the release. “The coalition’s lawsuit asserts that the executive branch does not have the legal authority to unilaterally incapacitate or dismantle it without an act of Congress.”\n\nThe department began operations in 1980 after President Carter signed into law the Department of Education Organization Act. Critics blasted the move as a sop by the president to the National Education Association in exchange for its campaign endorsement.\n\nRepublicans have sought to eliminate the department since President Reagan took office in 1981, but Mr. Trump’s 50% reduction in force represents the most dramatic step in that direction.\n\nRepublicans argue that the $268 billion department is inefficient, bloated and unnecessary, given that states and local governments are in charge of building and funding schools. Democrats counter that the department provides critical resources.\n\n“This administration may claim to be stopping waste and fraud, but it is clear that their only mission is to take away the necessary services, resources, and funding that students and their families need,” Ms. James said in a Thursday statement. “Firing half of the Department of Education’s workforce will hurt students throughout New York and the nation, especially low-income students and those with disabilities who rely on federal funding.”\n\nPrograms run by the department serve “nearly 18,200 school districts and over 50 million K-12 students attending roughly 98,000 public schools and 32,000 private schools,” said the Democrats in a statement.\n\nSchool districts in New York received $6.17 billion, or $2,438 per student, from the department in Fiscal Year 2024. Republicans argue that the funding comes with strings, such as requiring schools to adopt diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\n\nThe department said Tuesday that it will continue to fulfill its statutory obligations despite the staffing cuts, including student loans, Pell Grants, funding for special-needs students, grant-making and formula funding, but the Democrats were leery.\n\n“The administration’s layoff is so massive that ED will be incapacitated and unable to perform essential functions,” said the Democratic attorneys general in a press release.\n\nThe Democratic attorneys general joining Ms. James represent the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe department’s reduction in force included 600 employees who voluntarily retired or resigned. About 1,400 will be placed on administrative leave starting Friday.\n\nMs. McMahon said the workforce reductions reflect the department’s “commitment to efficiency, accountability, and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents, and teachers.”\n\n“I appreciate the work of the dedicated public servants and their contributions to the Department,” she said in her Tuesday statement. “This is a significant step toward restoring the greatness of the United States education system.”\n\nThe Education Department is the third-youngest of the Cabinet-level departments, older only than Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs.\n\n• Stephen Dinan contributed to this story.",

        "full_text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that Russia agrees in principle with the United States' ceasefire proposal, but key terms still need to be negotiated. He stressed that any agreement should lead to lasting peace and address the root causes of the conflict.\n\nPutin pointed out that Ukrainian troops remain encircled in their last foothold in Russia's Kursk region, and it must be determined whether they will surrender before the ceasefire takes effect.\n\nSpeaking to reporters before his meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, President Donald Trump reiterated his call for Russia to agree to a 30-day ceasefire with Ukraine.\n\n\"You don't want to waste time with a ceasefire if it's not going to mean anything. So we're saying, 'This is what you can get. This is what you can't get,'\" Trump said.\n\n\"Now we're going to see whether or not Russia is there and if they're not, it will be a very disappointing moment for the world,\" he added.\n\nLater, appearing with Rutte in the Oval Office, Trump called Putin's remarks \"promising but incomplete.\"\n\nThe ceasefire proposal, presented by U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff during negotiations in Moscow, was already accepted by Ukraine in talks held in Saudi Arabia earlier this week.\n\nThe diplomatic effort coincided with a Russian claim that its troops have driven the Ukrainian military out of a key town in Russia's Kursk border region, where Moscow has been trying for seven months to dislodge Ukrainian forces from their foothold.\n\nOn Thursday, Putin also emphasized the need to establish a mechanism to monitor potential violations of the truce and raised concerns about whether Ukraine might use the 30-day ceasefire to mobilize troops and rearm.\n\n\"We agree with the proposals to halt the fighting, but we proceed from the assumption that the ceasefire should lead to lasting peace and remove the root causes of the crisis,\" Putin said.\n\nPutin observed that while the U.S. appears to have persuaded Ukraine to accept a ceasefire, Kyiv's motivation likely stems from the battlefield situation. He pointed out that Ukrainian forces that entered the Kursk region are on the verge of being completely encircled in the coming days.\n\n\"Under these conditions, I believe it would be beneficial for Ukraine to secure a ceasefire for at least 30 days,\" he said.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, a senior Kremlin official rejected the idea of a temporary ceasefire, saying Russia was only interested in a long-term resolution of the Ukraine conflict, Russian media reported.\n\nBrian Taylor, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, told Newsweek via email: \"It's important to listen carefully to what Putin is saying. He supported the idea of a ceasefire in general, but then proceeded to stress the need to address the 'root causes' of the conflict. To Putin, the 'root cause' of the conflict is Ukraine's desire to be an independent country and choose it's own path in domestic and foreign policy. Further, he pointed to 'nuances' and proceeded to ask at least sixteen questions about the details of any ceasefire agreement. Putin's answer seems carefully crafted to sound like a 'yes' to Trump but be a 'no' in practice, unless Ukraine is forced to submit to Russia's demands.\"\n\nYuri Ushakov, an aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin, told Russia-1: \"We believe that our goal is a long-term peaceful settlement. We strive for this, a peaceful settlement that takes into account the legitimate interests of our country, our well-known concerns. It seems to me that no one needs any steps that imitate peaceful actions in this situation.\"\n\nWhite House national security adviser Mike Waltz said in a statement Tuesday: \"The Ukrainian delegation today made something very clear, that they share President Trump's vision for peace, they share his determination to end the fighting, to end the killing, to end the tragic meat grinder of people.\"\n\nUkraine President Volodymir Zelensky said in a video address on Sunday: \"We hope for results, both in bringing peace closer and in continuing support.\"\n\nWitkoff is set to meet with Putin on Thursday night in Moscow.\n\n\"The meeting between Witkoff and President Vladimir Putin will take place in a closed format this evening,\" Ushakov told the Russian state-owned news outlet Izvestia.\n\nThis story includes reporting from the Associated Press.\n\nUpdate 3/13/25, 12:58 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.\n\nUpdate 3/13/25, 12:22 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.\n\nUpdate 3/13/25, 1:26 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.\n\nUpdate 3/13/25, 2:03 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information and remarks by Trump.\n\nUpdate 3/13/25, 2:23 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information remarks.",

        "full_text": "Some academic institutions are finally facing a long-overdue reckoning after refusing to enforce the law (and their own policies) in the face of systemic abuses and lawlessness from pro-Hamas mobs. Jewish students have been threatened, attacked, harassed, and even prevented from attending classes or walking freely on their own campuses. Many of these episodes arguably or incontrovertibly constitute civil rights violations, on top of all the other chaos and dysfunction. One of the worst hotbeds of this disgraceful lawlessness has been Columbia University of the Ivy League, which now stands to lose hundreds of millions in taxpayer-funded grants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat bitter, richly-deserved reality is reportedly starting to set in:\n\nOne wonders if Columbia 'leadership' regrets taking this advice from Chuck Schumer:\n\nSenate majority leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) reportedly told Columbia University administrators to ignore the backlash they were receiving over the school’s handling of antisemitism on campus earlier this year, according to a new report from the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. Text messages included in the 300-page report reveal Schumer told then-university president Minouche Shafik that the school’s “political problems are really only among Republicans” and advised that its leaders should just “keep heads down” until the controversy came to an end.\n\nOops. Now the Trump administration is in charge and that plan has worked out very, very badly for Columbia. Other schools seem to be frantically trying to adjust to the new status quo, in which rampant anti-Semitism and pro-Hamas mobs won't be indulged by the federal government any longer:\n\nIt's amazing what threatened funding can do to light a fire under craven, gutless college administrators, who have previously feared their student and faculty mobs more than anything else. Amid some overdue accountability, Politico served up this pathetic headline:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Twitter/X 'Community Note' is helpful here:\n\nThe groups at issue are not “anti-war,”as this post claims. They call for violence explicitly — “violence is the only path forward.” Their most common phrase is: “We support liberation by any means necessary, including armed resistance.”\n\nAs I pointed out, these are neither \"anti-war\" nor \"protests.\" They are law-breaking mobs of Jew haters and terrorist supporters. They are not against war. They actively support violence and are rooting for Hamas in the war Hamas started. Put another way, they are very pro-war, so long as the Jews die and the Jewish state does not successfully defend itself. As for the deportation controversy involving a former Columbia grad student, I'll leave you with this juxtaposition:\n\nMany of those expressing outrage that this Hamas supporter may be deported have said nothing in defense of the Americans butchered and kidnapped by Hamas. Indeed, many of these same people tacitly or expressly supported the butchery and hostage-taking. I'm open to reasoned legal arguments about the case, which is why I'd recommend this piece by longtime federal prosecutor Andy McCarthy, who examines the facts and the law -- and argues in favor of deportation.",

It’s the first watchlist of the year.\n\nClaiming the U.S. was “once a global champion for democracy and human rights,” CIVICUS said Trump’s attempts to remake the federal government in his vision and remove the U.S. from global participation have raised concerns that it is infringing on democratic freedoms.\n\nThe U.S. joins the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan, Chile, Slovakia and 37 other countries on the list of countries with “narrowed” civic freedoms.\n\n“This is an unparalleled attack on the rule of law in the United States, not seen since the days of McCarthyism in the twentieth century,” Mandeep Tiwana, the interim co-secretary-general of CIVICUS, said in a release.\n\n“Restrictive executive orders, unjustifiable institutional cutbacks, and intimidation tactics through threatening pronouncements by senior officials in the administration are creating an atmosphere to chill democratic dissent, a cherished American ideal,” Tiwana added.\n\nCIVICUS’s “narrowed” category means people in the country can exercise civil freedoms but there are occasional violations of those rights. It is the second-highest rating tier after “open.”\n\nThe organization pointed to Trump’s mass firing of federal workers and replacing civil servants with loyalists as actions that could “severely impact constitutional freedoms.”\n\nTrump has carefully selected people who have proven deep loyalty to him to serve in powerful positions – regardless of experience or expertise.\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk, a “special government employee” with no official title, has assisted Trump in drastically reducing the federal workforce as they seek to cut spending by flagging departments, agencies or policies they believe are wasteful, abusive or fraudulent.\n\nAs a result, it has essentially stripped the U.S. Agency for International Development of its authority to provide humanitarian aid and assistance, as well as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau of its ability to enforce regulations that protect consumers from fraud or unfair practices.\n\nThrough executive orders, Trump has sought to consolidate power in the executive branch, making it easier for him and his allies to monitor and control departments and agencies to ensure they are only carrying out Trump’s agenda.\n\nThat includes ceasing all diversity, equity and inclusion policies, cracking down on pro-Palestinian student protests and providing assistance to undocumented immigrants.\n\n“The Trump administration seems hellbent on dismantling the system of checks and balances, which are the pillars of a democratic society,” Tiwana said in the press release.\n\nMonday’s list is not the first time the U.S. has been downgraded on CIVICUS’s watchlist. The country’s status was downgraded to “obstructed” in 2020 after CIVICUS found the Trump administration repressed mass protests.",

        "full_text": "“We have a serious problem in this country, which is that the American Bar Association, our major university law schools, and our major law firms have become an instrument of the hard Left,” deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said in a recent television interview, adding that “big law” has attempted “to turn law into an instrument of political repression for too many years.”\n\nThe ABA, established in the late 1800s, has grown into a sprawling organization that touts a membership of over 400,000 legal workers. It claims to be the “national voice of the legal profession,” weighing in on nominations of federal judges, engaging in litigation, and influencing hiring processes in other areas of the legal industry. A siloed-off part of the ABA handles law school accreditation, setting standards for universities and sparking controversies when those standards wade into political territory.\n\nSen. Mike Lee (R-UT), an outspoken legal voice in Congress, blasted the ABA this week as a “radical left-wing advocacy group.” Lee joined a handful of his Republican colleagues in writing a letter to the ABA’s president condemning the organization for embracing “woke initiatives,” including its heavy use of diversity, equity, and inclusion in many facets of its work.\n\nJudicial nominees\n\nThe Republicans, most of whom are on the panel that vets judicial nominations, said they would no longer consider the ABA’s ratings of prospective judges, which they said functioned as mere “endorsements” for Democratic-aligned nominees. Since the Eisenhower administration, the ABA has typically been given a heads-up on candidates for the federal bench and evaluated them as unqualified, qualified, or well qualified.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have boasted in the past about the ABA’s positive evaluations of their preferred candidates, such as Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, who received the highest rating the organization gives. But numerous conservative appointees have also received negative or mixed evaluations.\n\nThe GOP’s grievances with the ABA date back decades. The George W. Bush administration ended the practice of giving the ABA a first look at nominees, setting off a pattern in which Democratic administrations brought the practice back and the first Trump administration halted it again. The ABA has maintained that it will rate the nominees regardless of whether it is given early access to them.\n\nThe Republican senators called on Trump to stop referring to the ABA for the nomination process again — and if the past is any indication, Trump may be receptive to their request.\n\n‘Alienation of many conservatives’\n\nRight-of-center lawyers, such as George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, have said the ABA’s membership is diminished despite the organization still doing “many admirable things.”\n\n“Part of that decline may reflect the ideological bias of the organization,” Turley told the Washington Examiner. “The ABA once eschewed taking positions on political or ideological issues. It now regularly weighs in on such issues and is viewed as an overwhelmingly liberal organization.”\n\nThe ABA promotes Democratic-aligned viewpoints, such as “LGBTQ+” initiatives, support for abortion access, and DEI.\n\n“There are good-faith disagreements over constitutional interpretations, but the ABA often speaks for the members on adopting positions with its largely liberal leadership,” Turley said. “The result has been the alienation of many conservative, libertarian, and moderate lawyers.”\n\nSouth Texas College law professor Josh Blackman has frequently made similar observations and has urged the ABA to elevate members to its internal committees who span the ideological spectrum.\n\n“As the ABA drifts further and further away from the regulation of the legal profession, and focuses more and more on achieving progressive societal goals, the organization’s mandate dissolves,” Blackman warned in 2023.\n\nTrump administration\n\nTrump’s recently confirmed attorney general, Pam Bondi, has also taken aim at the ABA.\n\nBondi wrote a warning letter last month to its Council of the Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar, a powerful part of the ABA that operates independently of the rest of the organization and is the sole body to dole out law school accreditations.\n\nThe council has “for years” imposed “unlawful race and sex discrimination” on law students and staff “under the guise of ‘diversity’ mandates,” Bondi said. She said that while she was glad the section’s Standard 206, which requires schools’ “commitment to diversity,” had recently been suspended, it should be repealed entirely.\n\nMore broadly, the Trump administration is seeking out entities in the legal industry with Democratic ties, a move that comes as Trump has torn into lawyers working to help his political enemies or hinder his efforts to reshape rapidly and slim down the federal government through mass firings, abrupt contract terminations, and spending freezes.\n\nTrump signed executive orders stripping two major law firms of security clearances, Perkins Coie, which aided former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, and Covington & Burling, which Politico reported has been helping former Trump prosecutor Jack Smith. Individual lawyers have also drawn Trump’s wrath and been told they have lost security clearances, including prominent Democratic lawyer Norm Eisen and longtime lawyer Mark Zaid, who has represented clients in national security lawsuits across the political spectrum for years. Some of the lawyers and firms on Trump’s target list have already signaled they are pushing back on the president through lawsuits.\n\nTrump himself has not directly addressed the ABA’s role in judicial nominees, but the organization’s statement last week signaled it is displeased with the new administration.\n\nThe ABA’s president wrote that he is seeing from the Trump administration “wide-scale affronts to the rule of law itself, such as attacks on constitutionally protected birthright citizenship, the dismantling of USAID and the attempts to criminalize those who support lawful programs to eliminate bias and enhance diversity.”\n\nTRUMP SUSPENDS SECURITY CLEARANCES FOR LAWYERS WHO AIDED JACK SMITH\n\nWhen asked for comment on Republicans’ criticisms of the ABA, an organization spokesman pointed to the ABA accreditation council’s letter responding to Bondi.\n\nIn it, the council said its controversial Standard 206 “has been suspended and is not being enforced.” The council also reiterated that the section of the ABA that deals with accreditation is walled off from the rest of the ABA. The ABA has not responded to the GOP senators.",

        "full_text": "SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah will become the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, despite widespread opposition from dentists and national health organizations.\n\nRepublican Gov. Spencer Cox said he would sign legislation that bars cities and communities from deciding whether to add the mineral to their water systems.\n\nFluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.\n\nGovernment researchers have found that community water fluoridation prevents about 25% of tooth decay.\n\n“We’ve got tried and true evidence of the safety and efficacy of this public health initiative,” said American Dental Association President Brad Kessler, of Denver. Cavities could start emerging in children within months or years of Utah stopping fluoridation, Kessler said.\n\nThe ban comes weeks after federal health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has expressed skepticism about water fluoridation, was sworn into office.\n\n“It's not a bill I care that much about,” Cox added, “but it's a bill I will sign.”\n\nUtah lawmakers who pushed for a ban said putting fluoride in water was too expensive. Its Republican sponsor, Rep. Stephanie Gricius, acknowledged fluoride has benefits, but said it was an issue of “individual choice” to not have it in the water.\n\nCox said that like many people in Utah, he grew up and raised his own children in a community that doesn’t have fluoridated water — or what he called a “natural experiment.”\n\n“You would think you would see drastically different outcomes with half the state not getting it. We haven’t seen that,” Cox said in a weekend interview with ABC4 in Salt Lake City. “So it’s got to be a really high bar for me if we’re going to require people to be medicated by their government.”\n\nAlready, some cities across the country have gotten rid of fluoride from their water, and other municipalities are considering doing the same. A few months ago, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate fluoride in drinking water because high levels could pose a risk to kids’ intellectual development.\n\nA Utah teenager who urged lawmakers to pass the bill described suffering a medical emergency when the fluoride pump in Sandy, Utah, malfunctioned in 2019, releasing an excessive amount of the mineral into the drinking water. The fluoride sickened hundreds of residents and led many in Utah to push for its removal.\n\nIt’s rare to find high levels of fluoridation in water, according to the National Institutes of Health. The agency said it’s “virtually impossible” to get a toxic dose of fluoride from water with standard levels of the mineral.\n\nKessler said the amounts of fluoride added to drinking water have been reduced over time and are below levels considered problematic.\n\n“The science proves that it is effective at reducing cavities with little to no risk of other problems,” he said.\n\nHe added that a ban in Utah could have a domino effect with other legislatures being encouraged to follow suit with fluoride bans in their states.\n\nOpponents warned it would disproportionately affect low-income residents who may rely on public drinking water having fluoride as their only source of preventative dental care. Low-income families may not be able to afford regular dentist visits or the fluoride tablets some people buy as a supplement in cities without fluoridation.\n\nFluoridation is the most cost-effective way to prevent tooth decay on a large scale, said Lorna Koci, who chairs the Utah Oral Health Coalition.\n\nUtah in 2022 ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents that receive fluoridated water, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About two in five Utah residents served by community water systems received fluoridated water.\n\nIn February, the city council in Riverton, a Salt Lake City suburb, unanimously passed a resolution to remove fluoride from the city’s public water systems. Voters in Brigham City, 59 miles (95 kilometers) north of the capital city, struck down by a large margin a measure in 2023 that would have removed the mineral from its public water supply.\n\nOut of the 484 Utah water systems that reported data to the CDC in 2024, only 66 fluoridated their water, an Associated Press analysis showed. The largest was the state’s biggest city, Salt Lake City.\n\nRodney Thornell, president of the Utah Dental Association, began practicing dentistry in a Salt Lake City suburb before the city added fluoride to its water. His adult patients who grew up locally continue to get lots of cavities but younger patients who grew up with fluoride in the water get fewer, he said.\n\n“If we’re going to keep eating sugar, we need fluoride.” Thornell said, noting that Utah residents consume more than the national average of candy and sugary drinks.\n\n___\n\nBrown reported from Billings, Montana.",

        "full_text": "Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, dressed in fatigues, visited a command post near the front in Kursk late Wednesday to cheer on his military’s ejection of Ukrainian forces from much of the territory they had been occupying in the Russian border region.\n\nThe Russian leader’s pointed visit came a day after a U.S. delegation met in Saudi Arabia with Ukrainian officials, who agreed to a 30-day cease-fire in the war. American officials planned to take the proposal to Mr. Putin, who has previously said he is not interested in a temporary truce.\n\nDressed in a green camouflage uniform, Mr. Putin sat at a desk with maps spread out in front of him, according to photos released by the Kremlin. He appeared with Russia’s top military officer, Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov.\n\nIn video footage released by Russian state media, Mr. Putin praised the Russian military formations that had taken back much of the territory captured by Ukraine in the Kursk region. He called on the troops to seize the territory for good from Ukrainian forces, who have been occupying portions of the Russian border region since last summer. Kyiv had hoped to use the territory as a bargaining chip in peace talks.\n\nThe Russian leader also demanded that Ukrainian forces taken prisoner in the region be treated and prosecuted as terrorists under Russian law. General Gerasimov said more than 400 Ukrainian troops had been captured in the operations.\n\n“People who are on the territory of the Kursk region, committing crimes here against the civilian population and opposing our armed forces, law enforcement agencies and special services, in accordance with the laws of the Russian Federation, are terrorists,” Mr. Putin said.\n\nHe added that “foreign mercenaries” do not fall under the Geneva Convention governing the treatment of prisoners of war. The conflict, which began with Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, has drawn foreign fighters. This month, Russia sentenced a 22-year-old British man who had volunteered for the Ukrainian Army to 19 years in prison on terrorism and mercenary charges, after his capture in the Kursk region last year.\n\nRussian forces stepped up an offensive to push Ukrainian troops out of the region this week, as Kyiv reeled from the Trump administration’s decision last week to freeze U.S. intelligence and military assistance to Ukraine after an explosive confrontation in the Oval Office between President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.\n\nBy then, Russian forces were already well on their way to taking back Sudzha, the main population center in the Kursk region that was captured by Ukraine last year.\n\nFor months, Ukraine’s occupation of Russian territory has been a sore point for Moscow, which bolstered its forces with North Korean soldiers in an attempt to take back the land.\n\nRussian officials boasted of a breakthrough attack in Kursk last Saturday, when, they said, some 800 fighters traveled about 10 miles through a disused gas pipeline to carry out a surprise attack on the Ukrainian rear.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ukraine’s top military commander, Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky, said in a statement that Ukrainian forces would be moving to “more advantageous positions” if necessary and would “hold the line in the Kursk region for as long as it remains reasonable and necessary.” He added, “In the most difficult situations, my priority has been and remains the preservation of Ukrainian soldiers’ lives.”\n\nMr. Putin has said that any temporary cease-fire or truce will only provide an advantage to Ukrainian forces, who are on the back foot on the battlefield and could use the reprieve to replenish personnel.\n\nRussia has demanded a broader security agreement backed by the West, including a guarantee that Ukraine will not be admitted to the NATO military alliance, as well as other commitments that risk eroding Ukraine’s sovereignty.\n\n“We do not need a truce,” Mr. Putin said during his annual news briefing in December. “We need peace: a long-term and lasting peace with guarantees for the Russian Federation and its citizens.”\n\nMarc Santora contributed reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine.",

This will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S.,\" Trump said on Truth Social.\n\nOn Tuesday, the European Commission, the executive body of the EU, announced it was retaliating against U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum by lifting the suspension on previous levies on U.S. goods, including whiskey, and imposing new ones. Those changes will take effect in April.\n\n\"The European Union must act to protect consumers and business.

        "full_text": "Trump pledges to match EU and Canada's retaliatory tariffs\n\n7 days ago\n\nNatalie Sherman\n\nBusiness reporter, BBC News\n\nUS President Donald Trump has pledged to impose more tariffs after his latest move to introduce import taxes on steel and aluminium entering the US prompted retaliation from the European Union (EU) and Canada.\n\nTrump said that \"of course\" he would respond to the countermeasures, repeating his warning to reveal \"reciprocal\" tariffs next month on countries around the world.\n\n\"Whatever they charge us with, we're charging them,\" he said.\n\nThe threat marked a further escalation of a trade war which has rattled financial markets amid concerns over the impact on the economies and consumers in many countries around the world, including the US.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump moved forward with a plan to widen US tariffs on steel and aluminium, imposing a blanket duty of 25% and ending exemptions that the US had previously granted for shipments from some countries.\n\nThat followed an order earlier this month that raised levies on Chinese imports into the US to at least 20%.\n\nTrump has also threatened tariffs - which are taxes applied to goods as they enter a country - on a range of more specific items, including copper, lumber and cars.\n\nLeaders in Canada and Europe called the new metals taxes unjustified and struck back with their own tariffs on a range of US products.\n\nOther countries that are key US suppliers of metals, including the UK, Australia, Mexico and Brazil, held off on any immediate retaliation.\n\n\"Like everybody else, I'm disappointed to see global tariffs in relation to steel and aluminium but we will take a pragmatic approach,\" said UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.\n\n\"We are...negotiating a deal which covers and includes tariffs if we succeed. But we will keep all options on the table.\"\n\n'Bad for business, worse for consumers'\n\nCanada said from Thursday it would start charging a 25% tax on nearly C$30bn ($20bn; £16bn) worth of US products, including steel, computers and sports equipment.\n\nPrime Minister-designate Mark Carney said he was ready to negotiate a renewed trade deal with Trump, as long as there was \"respect for Canadian sovereignty\".\n\nThe EU said it would raise its levies on up to €26bn ($28bn; £22bn) worth of US goods, including boats, bourbon and motorbikes, from 1 April.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the response was intended to be \"strong but proportionate\" and added that the EU stood \"ready to engage in a meaningful dialogue\".\n\n\"Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business and worse for consumers,\" she said, warning the economic disruption put jobs at stake and would send prices higher.\n\n\"Nobody needs that – on both sides, neither in the European Union nor in the United States.\"\n\nTrump had said he wants to boost US steel and aluminium production in the longer run, but critics say in the immediate term the taxes on imports of the metals will raise prices for US consumers and dent economic growth.\n\nMajor packaged food makers including Quaker Oats and Folgers coffee asked Trump for targeted exemptions from tariffs on imports such as cocoa and fruit, according to a letter seen by Reuters.\n\nPepsiCo, Conagra and J M Smucker, also requested the president exempt ingredients not available from US sources in the letter, which was sent by the trade group the Consumer Brands Association.\n\nCoffee, oats, cocoa, spices, tropical fruit and tin mill steel, used for some food and household goods, are among the imports listed as unavailable domestically, Reuters reported.\n\nThe import taxes are also expected to reduce demand for steel and aluminium that is not made in the US - a blow to makers of the metals elsewhere.\n\nThe EU estimated that the latest US tariffs affect about 5% of its total exports to the US, while the US is the destination for roughly 90% of Canada's steel and aluminium exports.\n\nShares in the US were mixed on Wednesday, after two days of sharp decline. The Dow closed down 0.2%, while the S&P 500 ended nearly 0.5% higher and the Nasdaq jumped 1.2%.\n\nIn an appearance at the White House with the Irish prime minister, Taoiseach Micheál Martin, Trump said he did not plan to back down from his trade fight, saying he was \"not happy\" with EU trade policies.\n\nHe cited concerns about legal penalties it has imposed on Apple and rules he claimed put US farm products and cars at a disadvantage.\n\n\"They're doing what they should be doing perhaps for the European Union but it does create ill will,\" he said.\n\nRepeating his threat to hit European cars with tariffs, he added later: \"We're going to win that financial battle.\"",

        "full_text": "Donald Trump has a gift for inheriting valuable things. And the economy of January 2025 was no exception.\n\nWhen the president took office, stock values were hitting record highs, unemployment was hovering near historic lows, and consumer confidence was stable. Wall Street expected that business conditions would only improve. Among investors, conventional wisdom held that Trump was serious about corporate tax cuts — but not about launching an unprovoked trade war against America’s closest allies (a proposition too pointless and self-destructive to be sincere).\n\nTimes have changed. Contrary to corporate America’s wishful thinking, Trump has made good on his promise for large tariffs on Chinese goods, steel and aluminum from all countries, and many Mexican and Canadian imports, triggering retaliatory tariffs from America’s trade partners. Largely as a result of these developments, US stock markets forfeited six months of gains in three weeks, while consumer confidence fell precipitously. All this has led countless Americans to ask whether their economy is headed for a recession (Google searches for that word have skyrocketed since the beginning of March).\n\nThere is no certain answer to that question. Economic forecasters generally believe that the risk of a US downturn in 2025 has risen sharply over the past month, but still remains unlikely. What’s left of Wall Street’s optimism rests on a simple truth: Trump (almost certainly) has the power to stabilize the economy whenever he pleases by merely abandoning his most arbitrary and haphazard trade policies. But betting on the president’s prudence seems only a little safer than investing in his memecoin.\n\nWhy Wall Street is increasingly worried about the risk of a recession\n\nThe probability of a US recession has risen in recent weeks, according to major US banks. JPMorgan Chase now pegs the risk of a 2025 economic downturn at 40 percent, up from 30 percent at the start of the year. Goldman Sachs raised its own recession probability from 15 percent to 20 percent last week.\n\nEven if the US does not enter a proper recession — which is defined as six months of declining economic activity — the outlook for economic growth has soured, according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve, Morgan Stanley, and other analysts.\n\nTrump’s trade policies are the primary cause of such darkening forecasts.\n\nLarge and perpetually shifting tariffs hurt the economy in multiple ways. Tariffs are a tax on foreign-made goods paid by importers — such as retailers or manufacturers — who tend to pass their heightened costs onto consumers. This effectively reduces Americans’ purchasing power. According to one estimate from the Peterson Institute, if Trump’s tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada were to be fully implemented, and left in place, they would cost the typical US household $1,200 a year.\n\nWhen Americans make less money, they tend to reduce their spending on goods and services. And when consumer demand declines, businesses often lay off workers, who must then reduce their own spending — a dynamic that can yield a self-reinforcing, recessionary cycle.\n\nTrump has mitigated his tariffs’ impact on consumers by repeatedly pausing them, or adding temporary exemptions for certain goods. Yet the fact that the president’s trade policy is constantly changing creates its own problems.\n\nEconomic uncertainty is bad for investment. As harmful as Trump’s tariffs are, if businesses knew they would be permanent, then some might invest in new US factories or mines that wouldn’t have been financially viable under conditions of free trade. By contrast, if no one can be sure that Trump won’t roll back those tariffs tomorrow then investing in such factories would be perilous. Uncertainty therefore leads many investors and companies to delay investment until long-term economic conditions become clear. And a pullback in investment reduces demand in the economy, thereby increasing the risk of recession.\n\nThese factors lay the groundwork for a stock market selloff. But that sell-off was accelerated by the president’s nonchalant attitude toward falling equity values. For months, financial analysts had assumed that the stock market boasted a veto over Trump’s most ill-advised economic policies: Given the president’s past enthusiasm for bragging about record stock prices, many believed that Trump would roll back his tariffs in response to any sustained drop.\n\nBut over the past week, the president and his advisers have signaled the opposite: That they are comfortable with inducing economic pain in the immediate term, for the sake of realizing their broader ideological goals. Asked about whether he expected a recession this year, Trump told Fox News last Sunday that he didn’t like to “predict things like that” but “there is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big. … And there are always periods of, it takes a little time.”\n\nAlthough Trump has been the primary driver of declining investor sentiment, he is not the sole cause of economic concern. The economy of January 2025 was broadly considered strong. But it had some vulnerabilities. Years of inflation had eroded Americans’ savings, causing some to fall behind on their loans. Credit card delinquencies and late payments on auto loans both rose in the final quarter of last year. And the labor market has shown some signs of slackening, with the percentage of Americans who say they can only find part-time work rising and the typical number of weekly hours worked falling to its lowest point since June 2010.\n\nThe Trump-induced stock market collapse risks exacerbating these sources of economic strain, since affluent households often pare back spending when the value of their stock portfolios declines.\n\nThe risk of a downturn is rising, but the odds are still low\n\nAll this said, there’s reason to think fears of an imminent recession have been overhyped. One source of such anxieties is the Atlanta Fed’s GDP forecast, which turned negative in recent weeks. But the Fed’s model is highly volatile, and its current projections are largely informed by data from early this year, particularly a 0.2 percent decline in consumer spending during January.\n\nBut there’s reason to think that this dip reflected fleeting headwinds. After all, much of the country experienced major winter storms in January, while southern California was devastated by wildfires. These natural disasters surely kept many Americans away from retailers, restaurants, and other businesses.\n\nIt is true that consumer sentiment has fallen precipitously in recent months, in response to the public’s anxieties over Trump’s tariffs. But such surveys have not been very predictive of consumers’ actual spending habits in recent years.\n\nMeanwhile, the US economy continued adding jobs in February and unemployment remains low by historical standards. One of the government’s gauges of inflation also came in unexpectedly low Wednesday, showing that consumer prices were only 2.8 percent higher in February 2025 than they were one year earlier. If inflation continues to decline, then the Federal Reserve may feel comfortable cutting interest rates, which would make it easier for consumers to spend and businesses to invest.\n\nTrump could stabilize the economy if he wanted to\n\nWhile the US economy isn’t devoid of complicated challenges, Trump could all but eliminate the threat of a recession anytime he wishes. All he needs to do is rescind his unpopular and arbitrary tariffs.\n\nDoing so would not undermine any of the president’s more respectable economic goals. Putting 25 percent tariffs on industrial inputs made in Canada and Mexico is not beneficial for American manufacturing, but harmful to it. And alienating core US allies does not bolster our nation’s national security but jeopardizes it.\n\nGoldman Sachs’s belief that the risk of a recession is only 20 percent hinges on Trump’s responsiveness to deteriorating economic conditions: The fact that “the White House has the option to pull back if the downside risks begin to look more serious” tempers the bank’s anxiety.\n\nPerhaps, if stocks remain depressed — while unemployment climbs — the president will decide to prioritize Americans’ economic well-being over his own ideological hobby horses. But I’m not sure that I’d put money on it. And a growing number of investors seem to feel the same.",

        "full_text": "Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino.\n\nWith the Republican-controlled Congress moving forward with President Donald Trump’s call to extend the 2017 individual tax cuts, Democrats and Republicans are spinning the facts about who would benefit. Several Democrats have framed the tax cuts as exclusively benefiting billionaires, while Trump has suggested everyone in America would see a tax cut.\n\nOn average, taxpayers in every income group would get some tax relief. But not everyone. In all, about two-thirds to three-quarters of taxpayers would get a tax cut, according to independent analyses. Also, the cuts skew in favor of wealthy Americans, who would see more tax relief not only in the dollar amount but as a percentage of income, on average. But again, the wealthy wouldn’t be the only ones to benefit.\n\n(For clarity, people would experience an extension not as a tax cut but as the absence of a tax increase if the provisions were allowed to expire.)\n\nSome economists also warn that if the GOP plan includes spending cuts to Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits (or food stamps), lower-income Americans would, on net, fare worse, even with the tax cuts.\n\nIn order to pass the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act with a simple majority in the Senate, Republicans had to use a process called reconciliation — which means the law could not add to the deficit after 10 years. To meet that requirement, most of the individual tax cuts are set to expire at the end of 2025.\n\nThe 2017 law lowered marginal tax rates, increased the standard deduction and eliminated the personal exemption, increased the child tax credit, limited deductions for state and local taxes as well as mortgages and home equity lines of credit, and increased the threshold for estate taxes, among other measures.\n\nRepublicans are turning to reconciliation again to extend the tax cuts beyond this year. On Feb. 25, House Republicans took the first step in doing that. They narrowly passed a budget resolution that would allow for $4.5 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years and $2 trillion in spending reductions over the same time period.\n\nThe resolution didn’t specify what spending cuts would be made, but there’s little doubt Medicaid would face cuts under the framework, as we’ve explained. Both houses of Congress need to agree on a budget resolution before any specific spending reductions would be proposed.\n\nWho Benefits from Tax Cut Extension?\n\nWhen the TCJA passed in 2017, the expiring nature of some of the tax cuts led to the oft-repeated, but misleading talking point from Democrats that the top 1% would get 83% of the tax cuts under the new law. As we wrote, that was only true when or if the individual tax provisions expired. (The top 1% would still benefit from the remaining provisions, such as a reduction in the corporate tax rate.)\n\nNow, some Democrats are claiming or suggesting that if the individual tax cuts are extended — as the Republican budget blueprint seeks to do — mostly or only the wealthiest Americans would benefit.\n\nIn her response to Trump’s address to Congress on March 4, Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin said, “President Trump is trying to deliver an unprecedented giveaway to his billionaire friends. He’s on the hunt to find trillions of dollars to pass along to the wealthiest in America.”\n\nIn an interview on CNBC on Feb. 25, Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone went further, wrongly claiming that the “average person” would not benefit from the tax cuts included in the Republican budget plan.\n\nPallone said the Republican tax plan “basically, you know, just helps the very wealthy and large corporate interests.” Advocating allowing the tax cuts to expire, Pallone added, “I don’t think that the average person benefits from this tax cut.”\n\n“The bottom line is the Republicans are doing nothing to try to provide any kind of tax cut or help for the average American,” Pallone said. “It’s all about corporate interests, large corporate interests, billionaires. That’s what this is all about.”\n\nTrump framed the tax cuts much differently in his address to Congress on March 4.\n\n“The next phase of our plan to deliver the greatest economy in history is for this Congress to pass tax cuts for everybody,” Trump said. “They’re in there, they’re waiting for you to vote.”\n\nAn Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center analysis of extending all of the TCJA tax cuts concluded that “on average, all income groups would get a tax cut.”\n\nContrary to Pallone’s claim about the “average person” not benefiting from the extension of TCJA tax cuts, the average taxpayer — defined as the middle 20% of income earners (those earning between $65,100 and $116,400) — would see an average tax cut of $1,030 in 2027, or about 1.3% of after-tax income.\n\nA spokesman for Pallone noted that the average tax cut for someone making under $50,000 would be $273, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, while the average tax cut for a taxpayer making over $1 million would be $78,717. That wealthy taxpayers would derive more benefit is clear, but most “average” taxpayers would derive some benefit from the tax cuts. The spokesman noted that the tax cuts would not be enough to offset the impact of potential spending cuts to Medicaid and other programs.\n\nThat taxpayers in every income category would see tax cuts was echoed in an analysis by the Tax Foundation.\n\n“Making all the expiring provisions permanent, including the estate and business provisions, would increase after-tax incomes by 2.9 percent on average in 2026,” Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy with the Tax Foundation’s Center for Federal Tax Policy, told us via email. “The top quintile would see a 3.3 percent increase on average, while the bottom quintile would see a 2.8 percent increase on average. So while the policies would provide a larger increase in after-tax income to higher income taxpayers, they also provide tax cuts to taxpayers across the income spectrum.”\n\nAnd contrary to Trump’s statement, his tax plans would not result in tax cuts for everybody.\n\nOverall, about three-quarters of households would get a tax cut, while about 10% would get a tax increase, according to the Tax Policy Center analysis. The percentage of winners and losers would vary by income category, TPC found: “About 86% of middle-income households would get a tax cut” while “about 13% would see their taxes rise.” Among the top 1%, “taxes would fall for about 81%, while they’d rise for 19%.”\n\nThat’s only for an extension of the TCJA tax cuts, and Trump has also proposed eliminating taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. But as Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told us via email, “almost nobody benefits from tax-free tips” and “tax free Social Security benefits go almost entirely to high-income retirees (since those with low-incomes already pay no tax on their benefits).”\n\nThe Tax Foundation estimates that making the expiring individual provisions of the TCJA permanent would translate a tax cut for 62% of tax filers, including for 84% of middle income Americans.\n\nAddressing the House GOP Issues Conference on Jan. 27, Trump said that “we want to keep people’s taxes low and actually make them lower. And that’s not just rich people, that’s everybody. It’s frankly proportionately the lower scale much more so than a higher scale.”\n\nHowever, wealthy earners would get an outsized share of tax benefits. TPC estimated that households making over $450,000 (the top 5% of households) would be the income group getting the largest percentage of benefits from extending the tax cuts: just over 45%. Moreover, higher earners would see a higher percentage tax cut than middle- and lower-income Americans. The tax cuts would average 3.2% of after-tax income for the top 1% of households, compared with 1.3% for the middle 20% of households.\n\nIn that same address, Trump falsely claimed that if the TCJA tax cuts were not permanently extended, “you’re going to have about a 60% tax increase.” The TPC estimates that an extension of the tax cuts would reduce the average tax rate by about 1.4 percentage points in 2027.\n\nIn the weekly House Democrats’ press conference on Feb. 25, Democratic Rep. Brendan Boyle said the deep spending cuts proposed in the Republican resolution were being made “to partially pay for trillions of dollars in tax cuts, most of which go to the richest 1% of Americans.”\n\nHis point about the share of benefits going to the top 1% is a bit exaggerated. While the tax cuts are tilted toward the wealthy, the richest 1% — households earning over $1 million — would get 23.5% of the benefits from the tax cuts in 2027 — so not most, according to the TPC. Nonetheless, more than half of the benefits would go to the top 10% that year.\n\nIn its analysis of the House Republican plan, the Penn Wharton Budget Model reached similar conclusions on the distributional effects of the tax cuts on a conventional basis (before the economic impact of the tax cuts are factored in).\n\n“On a conventional basis in 2026, the first 80 percent of the income distribution receives about 29 percent of the total value of the proposed tax cuts while the top 10 percent of the income distribution receives about 56 percent of the value,” Kent Smetters, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, told us via email. He noted that, “under current law, the top 10% of the income distribution pays about 70% of all federal taxes.”\n\nPWBM also considered the results if the tax cuts are paid partially through cuts to Medicaid and SNAP.\n\nIf cuts are made to those programs, “then lower income households are worse off,” Smetters said, though he noted that “those decisions have not been made yet.”\n\nAs we said, it’s unknown whether the House budget resolution will move forward and what specific spending cuts lawmakers will ultimately propose.\n\nGiven the disproportionate effect Medicaid and SNAP cuts would have on lower-income households, “Even with economic growth, lower income households are worse off if mandatory spending cuts, still to be decided under budget reconciliation, are allocated to programs like Medicaid and SNAP,” the PWBM analysis concluded.\n\nMany Democrats — including former President Joe Biden — had also hoped to extend the tax cuts, but only for those making under $400,000 a year. In a House Rules Committee hearing on Feb. 24, Rep. Jim McGovern, the ranking Democrat on the committee, offered several amendments to cap the extension of tax cuts at various income levels — first for those making under $400,000 per year, then at $1 million, then at $100 million, then $1 billion per year. All were rejected along party lines.",

        "full_text": "Given the many global challenges it is tackling, “nobody wants the State Department to be in a position where USAID was, where it had difficulty operating,” the official insisted. (I granted the official and others interviewed anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue.)\n\nFor Rubio, though, the fight over the future structure of the State Department isn’t just about protecting America’s ability to engage in diplomacy. It’s about protecting what power he has in the Trump administration.\n\nThis is, after all, a team of many rivals. Rubio is the chief U.S. diplomat, but an array of other Trump appointees are competing to shape the administration’s foreign policy, from Musk to multiple special envoys. As Musk eyes his department, Rubio has realized he needs to both draw lines and walk some very fine ones.\n\nIt doesn’t help that Rubio’s past foreign policy views have frequently clashed with Trump’s vision. It means Rubio is now taking stances at odds with his reputation, such as slamming the foreign minister of Poland this week.\n\n“He’s in this awkward situation,” said Gerald Feierstein, a former career diplomat who served as U.S. ambassador to Yemen. “He’s doing things that he fundamentally believes are bad policy and bad steps. He’s got to go along with it because Musk and Trump are standing between him and his higher ambition of being president.”\n\nI did not expect to write this often about Rubio (this is my third column on him in two months), and he is far from the only Cabinet member dealing with blowback from moves made by Musk and his aides. But Rubio is drawing unusual interest because USAID’s brutal takedown was so early in Trump’s term, because of the national security implications of slashing the State Department and because he’s already seen as one of the weaker Trump appointees.\n\nTo remedy the last perception, Rubio has taken advantage of what the secretary of State’s perch offers — not the least of which is access to a ready press pool — to show he can score wins for Trump.\n\nHe’s deeply involved in talks about ending Russia’s war on Ukraine; he has pushed, with some success, Panama to distance itself from China amid Trump’s threats of a Panama Canal takeover; and he has helped enforce Trump’s immigration crackdown. Already, he’s spent a significant amount of time on the road, carrying the Trump banner everywhere from the Munich Security Conference to Israel.\n\nAt times, Rubio has seemed out of place.\n\nHis couch-sinking silence as Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy helped inspire a “Saturday Night Live” parody. Still, Rubio has tried to dispel suspicions that he disagrees with Trump, going on television repeatedly to defend positions he would never have taken when he was a senator.\n\nRubio has even publicly supported dismantling USAID. But he didn’t have much say in it. By the time Rubio was named USAID’s acting administrator, Musk, DOGE and Trump political appointee Pete Marocco had largely unraveled the institution.\n\nIt was Rubio, though, who took much of the resulting heat from Capitol Hill, the courts and his own workforce, even as he never gained control of the USAID situation. (He did, however, protect some programs, saving about 400 that DOGE wanted to cut.)\n\nThe State Department is different — and Rubio is less willing to sacrifice it the way he did USAID.\n\nRubio agrees, in principle, with major changes, including staff reductions and closing some diplomatic facilities. But he wants to restructure the department in a way that satisfies Trump and keeps Musk at bay but safeguards his main base of power. If he lets Musk and DOGE eliminate huge chunks of State without a serious strategy, he will only weaken the department and himself. Foreign officials trying to understand Trump administration dynamics are among those watching closely and asking people like myself if Rubio is the best point of contact.\n\n“Rubio wants to be a diplomat,” the person familiar with the situation said. “Everything DOGE does creates problems for him in terms of diplomacy.”\n\nAlthough lists of consulates to close and staffers to fire have been circulating for weeks, Rubio still hasn’t acted, frustrating Musk.\n\nSome Rubio aides and people at the National Security Council tried last week to push out Marocco, who is not in DOGE but is a lead figure in dismantling USAID. Rubio, however, sided with other senior administration officials who wanted to keep Marocco, according to the person familiar with the situation.\n\nThe official close to Rubio denied there was any such attempt. Marocco’s team emailed me a statement from him in which he called Trump and Rubio “historic patriots” and said it was the “honor of a lifetime” to serve the pair to “reform and realign foreign assistance,” but he did not address questions about his job.\n\nThe official further urged patience — a hard ask of U.S. diplomats who fear for their jobs and livelihoods.\n\n“Good, substantive reforms take time,” the official said. “The president’s been pretty clear that there need to be significant changes in the way that the federal government is organized. I think every Cabinet secretary is going about that in their own specific way to make sure those changes are smart, they stick and that core capabilities and functions are retained.”\n\nThe State Department declined to comment, but a senior official there stressed that Musk and Rubio have a “great relationship” and are working together “to correct the failures of the last administration.”\n\nMusk did not respond to my request for comment.\n\nTrump is trying to appease all sides. During last week’s meeting, he told Cabinet members they get to run their agencies but also said Musk would serve as an enforcer to ensure cuts take place.\n\nThe president also has insisted that Rubio and Musk get along just fine. “ELON AND MARCO HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP. ANY STATEMENT OTHER THAN THAT IS FAKE NEWS!!!” Trump posted this weekend on Truth Social.\n\nRubio and Musk are now trying to publicly show that’s true.\n\nRubio used social media to thank DOGE for slashing USAID’s programs, to which Musk replied that it was “good” working with Rubio. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt noted to reporters that the pair attended dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Saturday.\n\nAnd Rubio and Musk took to social media this weekend to gang up on Radosław Sikorski, the foreign minister of Poland, a U.S. ally.\n\nAfter Musk said that Ukraine’s front line could collapse if he turned off his Starlink satellite services, Sikorski noted that his country was paying for those services and might have to find other providers if they were turned off.\n\nRubio dismissed Sikorski as “making up” the threat and told him to “say thank you” for Starlink. Musk piled on: “Be quiet, small man.”\n\nPerhaps beating up on common enemies — a group that these days includes U.S. allies — is the glue that will bond Rubio and Musk together going forward.\n\nThat said, the secretary of State has some tough choices ahead as he restructures his department. He has managed to slow-roll Musk on that front for now, but we’ll see how long the forced bonhomie lasts.",

        "full_text": "Say what you will about Donald Trump, nobody can argue that he doesn’t possess an amazing superpower. Actually, he has several superpowers, but his most powerful may be the ability to convince his opponents to defend the least popular possible positions just because he supports them. Not just contrary positions, not just positions that reasonable people can disagree with, but insanely unpopular positions that all normal people look at and are repelled by. There’s not a garbage hill they won’t choose to die on. It’s an incredibly useful superpower to have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, the most recent one is the 80/20 polling proposition against men pretending to be women and being allowed into women’s intimate spaces to steal their athletic achievements. What lunatic would possibly take the position that it’s OK for some dude with the whole sausage store swinging to walk into your daughter’s locker room and expect to be called Martha? Well, it’s not just one lunatic. It’s a whole party of lunatics. This is a sacred Democrat belief, maybe its most sacred belief. Just the other day, every single Democrat senator voted to continue this nonsense. But in the real world, eight out of 10 normal people understand that it’s insane, and the other 20%, probably half of them, don’t agree with the majority because they can’t wrap their minds around the fact that it’s actually happening.\n\nOf course, Trump opposes it, and of course, he rubbed it in their faces at that glorious not-State of the Union address the other night. Naturally, the Democrats highlighted their embrace of this bizarre, creepy fringe belief system right in front of 36 million Americans. It’s no wonder that 76% of the people who watched the thing supported the president. Politically, it’s just insane to draw the battle lines about weirdos and perverts, but the Democrats do it. It kind of tells you what their main constituency is – weirdos and perverts and the SSRI-ridden, Chardonnay wine Munchhausen Mommies that love them.\n\nEmbracing it makes absolutely no sense politically unless their entire focus is maintaining their psychotic leftist activist base. And, of course, their entire focus is maintaining their psychotic leftist activist base. You might think they would reach out in a systematic way to normal people, and some have tried. Gavin Newsom, the guy whose unalloyed support for kiddie castration and against penis-free female environments helped make California the sexual confusion capital of America, recently went on with Charlie Kirk and hinted that, well, you know, maybe it’s kinda unfair to let some hairy ape pretending to be a ballerina win the gold medal in a girl track meet. Don’t get the idea that he is actually going to do anything about it. California is still a gender freak state where every pervert is a king, and every normal person is liable to be leered at in the locker room – and, in his trash state, if you complain that some dude in a skirt is drooling over you while you slip on your panties, you’re a hate criminal. Other Democrats have realized that this is electoral cyanide, and they’ve tried to thread the needle by suggesting that maybe local governments should decide whether the perverts rule or not. They don’t think that about anything else, like abortion, just this, and they don’t really think it. If they get federal power back, you can be sure that the full force of law will come down in support of weirdo transvestites getting a free pass at exposing themselves to little girls.\n\nTrump is somehow able to maneuver them into being all for such loathsome demographics as federal workers. Yeah, Americans feel sorry for the kind of person who tells them they can’t sign their VA form in blue ink. Not a lotta sympathy there. And Americans seem to like the idea of cutting government waste. Sure, the Democrats insist that we’re about to launch a Third World genocide by refusing to fully fund Ecuadorian transgender mime troupes, but normal people look at that and hear that it’s being cut, and they think it’s a good thing. This is because it is, objectively, a good thing. To support this stuff is, objectively, an insane thing.\n\nNow, it’s not crazy in the sense that doing so does support the Democrat position that all normality and civilization must be overthrown in favor of the bizarre, creepy freak show utopia that they hope to impose upon us. It’s insane because it’s electoral poison. Look at what happened to Kamala Harris when she got up there and had to try and tap dance about subsidizing illegal alien transsexual surgeries. It’s hard to explain this sort of stuff, and it should be hard because this sort of stuff is stupid and horrific. A few Democrats understand that this stuff repels normal people. That’s their problem. And that’s Trump’s edge.\n\nWhat’s the latest? Some Third World Muslim scumbag terrorist-lover who somehow got into our country and somehow got into one of our allegedly prestigious schools is using that as a base to demand the murder of Jews and everybody else. Remember – they don’t just want to stop killing all the Jews. They want to kill you and me, too. They will tell you that if you listen, and thanks to the fact that we have broken the gatekeeping model of the regime media, conservative media, and social media can now tell you. You can go read what this scumbag’s positions are. He wants October 7 all over the world. That means you and your kids and your sons and your daughters are being raped and murdered on videotape for the delight of Third World semi-humans. Yeah, we’re totally morally obligated to let this creature onto our soil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s been said before: The Constitution is not a suicide pact.\n\nNow, the reasonable position among Americans is that this kind of walking, talking pile of refried goat excrement shouldn’t be anywhere near our country. It’s not a matter of free speech. You don’t get to come here and start setting up your garbage revolution. Do the Democrats agree with that view? No. They’re perfectly happy to let the genocidal jihadi to do his thing. In this monster, they have finally found some “free speech” they’re concerned with protecting. They were never concerned with free speech on campus when it was conservatives trying to speak freely. They were never concerned when the federal government launched a pogrom against normal Americans who went to protest a bogus election and dared to walk through the Capitol that they own. Even now, Democrats are positively gleeful that Elon Musk’s participation in our government is being met by leftist-funded terrorists burning down Tesla stores. But this Hamas-sucking mutant who literally wants to murder you and your entire family? No, he’s got to be here. He’s got to get a free megaphone. He has every right to come here and destroy our country and kill your kids. Because of reasons and shut up, fascist.\n\nThat’s the Democrat position. But why do they hold such a manifestly politically unpopular position? Because that’s what the black, shriveled heart of the Democrat Party believes. And also because Donald Trump feels differently. One thing is for certain – Donald Trump’s superpower is in full effect, and right now, he’s laughing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow Kurt on Twitter @KurtSchlichter.

        "full_text": "Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced Wednesday that the agency will take 31 “historic actions” to roll back the Biden administration’s climate agenda in line with President Donald Trump’s executive order to “Unleash American Energy.”\n\n“By overhauling massive rules on the endangerment finding, the social cost of carbon and similar issues, we are driving a dagger through the heart of climate-change religion and ushering in America’s Golden Age,” Zeldin stated in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nZeldin said the actions will lower costs for things like purchasing a car, heating homes and operating businesses. Among the regulations Zeldin said the EPA would reconsider are the “illegal” Clean Power Plan 2.0., the endangerment finding, the electric vehicle mandate, and rules regarding particulate matter.\n\n“Today marks the death of the Green New Scam. The EPA recognizes that environmental protection and economic prosperity aren’t mutually exclusive goals,” Zeldin wrote in the Journal.\n\nHe also said the EPA would remain committed to a mission of protecting the environment, but not by shutting down power plants. Rather, he said, the EPA would protect the environment by making energy production cleaner and more efficient.\n\nBy reducing the regulatory impediments to industry, Zeldin said in an announcement posted on X, jobs would be created, especially in the auto industry.\n\n“From the campaign trail to day one and beyond, President Trump has delivered on his promise to unleash energy dominance and lower the cost of living. We at EPA will do our part to power the great American comeback,” Zeldin said.",

        "full_text": "Archimedes Banya will allow trans people at its monthly ladies-only and men-only nights, in a reversal of a recent policy that drew criticism and an investigation.\n\nThe full-nude Russian bathhouse in the Bayview announced the change Wednesday. The spa now asks attendees of its “Special Women’s Night” event “to keep their genitals covered” to respect the religious and cultural beliefs of women “who feel most comfortable in a space without visible genitals.”\n\n“We have come to the realization that the present moment is a critical time in history when people of transgender identity are in need of an abundance of support for their rights and freedoms,” the spa’s statement said.\n\nThe bathhouse’s policy is to be “inclusive of all people of transgender identity, for all women’s nights and men’s nights, provided that the person’s gender identity conforms to the night in question.”\n\nArchimedes Banya recently updated its policy for gender-specific nights to exclude trans people. The language on the ladies-only event listing initially said that only “BIOLOGICAL WOMEN” would be allowed, before being updated to “sex assigned at birth.”\n\nThe city’s Human Rights Commission last week began investigating the bathhouse for excluding trans people two days a month.\n\nResponses to the policy were mixed, with some saying the change was necessary for religious inclusivity. Banya staff defended the decision to exclude trans people and clarified that trans women would be allowed on a second women’s night.\n\nIn the statement Wednesday, the bathhouse said it stands by its original aim of supporting “the freedom and autonomy of women whose religious practices require a more restricted environment.”\n\n“We intended to provide this support as well as to provide inclusiveness of trans community members, by welcoming those of transgender identity on both inclusive women’s night and almost every other day of each month,” the spa said. “We see now that the word ‘almost’ in ‘almost every other day of the month’ is an opportunity to go further to support the transgender community.”",

        "full_text": "The founder of a women-only gym has found herself at the center of a social media storm—with both critics and supporters—after she walked-back her initial plans to include trans-female clients.\n\nNatalee Barnett, a 25-year-old fitness influencer from the U.K. with hundreds of thousands of followers across various platforms online, has been updating her \"nataleebfitness\" fans for years about her plan to open her own gym. She is currently preparing to open a venue in London called \"The Girls Spot\" catering specifically for women.\n\nFour years ago, in 2021, Barnett posted on X (formerly Twitter) to confirm that trans-women would also be welcome when she opened. However, on Sunday, she released a video statement on X saying her soon-to-open gym is now only \"for biological women.\" Her lengthy explanation, watched by more than 32 million viewers and shared more than 15,000 times, has been greeted with a mix of both fury and praise from X users.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to Barnett via her Instagram page seeking further information and comment on the furor.\n\nThe episode comes amid an increasingly bitter cultural debate about the rights of transgender people in society, particularly relating to their inclusion in women's sports and women-only spaces. Trans athletes, such as the swimmer Lia Thomas, have been accused of \"stealing\" podium wins from cisgender women who have not undergone male puberty. While Thomas's competitor-turned-activist Riley Gaines has also said that women being forced to change alongside transgender athletes who have male genitalia constitutes a form of sexual abuse.\n\nPresident Donald Trump recently enshrined his stance on the debate in law, by signing an executive order barring transgender female athletes from competing in women's or girls' sporting events.\n\nThe U.K. has been riven by similar debates about the role trans athletes should play in women's sport, so Barnett's gym has now found itself in the eye of the storm.\n\nBarnett revealed on X on February 2 that her long-time goal of opening a women's gym was set to become a reality this year. She shared photos of her posing outside The Girls Spot alongside an X post from 2021 when the then-21-year-old first outlined her plans to open her own gym.\n\nHowever, another post she shared in 2021 has also received renewed attention.\n\nFour years ago, Barnett had written that, \"respectfully, if you have a problem with trans women attending my gym then you can find another gym to train at. I have discussed this several times before, trans women are women and also a minority that need to be protected. Please keep your transphobia away.\"\n\nBut in an X post this weekend, the gym owner explained that she had changed her mind about the admittance of trans-women, writing: \"Addressing my tweet from 2021. The Girls Spot operates as a female-only gym for biological women, tackling harassment, sexual assault & violence that women face inside the gym. The tweet circling was made 4 years ago and I was in the very early stages of creating a concept.\"\n\nShe also attached a video in which she spoke directly to the camera to explain her reasoning. She told viewers the gym was designed to be a safe space for women who often suffer from sexual harassment at mixed gyms.\n\nShe also said she has now had several years to work out exactly what she wants her venue to provide, saying that \"the meaning of The Girls Spot gym is now entirely different.\" She added: \"Whilst we are a gym, inside we are focusing on self defense classes, Muay Thai, boxing classes, as well as workshops and activations around PCOS [polycystic ovary syndrome] and training on your menstrual cycle, all of which occur to biological women.\"\n\nAddressing my tweet from 2021.The Girls Spot operates as a female-only gym for biological women, tackling harassment, sexual assault & violence that women face inside the gym.The tweet circling was made 4 years ago and I was in the very early stages of creating a concept. pic.twitter.com/R4i6iUCMLA\n\nLater in the video, she stressed: \"We do believe that everybody deserves a safe space and there are many gyms that are starting to have mixed cubicles in changing rooms so that individuals can feel safer and more included in these environments. But The Girls Spot gym as a standalone is a female-only gym because it is imperative that I stick to the vision and the mission and ensure that these women feel safe.\"\n\nA follow-up X post added: \"I believe trans women and other individuals deserve safe spaces too, that hasn't changed.\"\n\nBarnett's decision on the membership of her gym sparked both delight and despair among internet commentators.\n\nOne X user, whose profile said she is an \"adult human female,\" said: \"THANK YOU for standing up for biological women and girls this way. May your business thrive.\"\n\nBut another commentator, whose profile says they are \"nonbinary writer,\" said: \"I hope your gym fails honestly. How you creating a 'safe space' but excluding the most vulnerable? (sic)\"\n\nAnd others questioned how Barnett would enforce her policy and wondered who would be affected by that.\n\nOne X user, who described themselves as a 23-year-old \"fat\" person, said: \"how do you intend to police that in a way that is not incredibly invasive?\"\n\nWhile another added: \"what do the logistics ACTUALLY look like ? checking private parts at the door ??? when muscular c!s [cisgender] women who don't look 'woman enough' want to come what then ? when those women experience discrimination from other women trying to transinvestigate, what then ?? as a business woman, i'm interested to see how you imagine this working.\"\n\nBarnett has set up a pink-themed website for The Girls Spot, which is set to open in the spring. Would-be clients are invited to sign up to the waiting to list to \"become a founding member,\" where they can \"feel safe, protected, and inspired to thrive in a space built just for you.\"",

        "full_text": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said that the government will deport lawful permanent residents who support Hamas and came to the U.S. as students with an intent “to rile up all kinds of anti-Jewish student, antisemitic activities,” referencing the Palestinian rights protests at universities in 2024.\n\n“And if you end up having a green card – not citizenship, but a green card – as a result of that visa while you’re here and those activities, we’re going to kick you out. It’s as simple as that. This is not about free speech. This is about people that don’t have a right to be in the United States to begin with,” Rubio said on March 12, 2025.\n\nThat policy has now ensnared Mahmoud Khalil, a recent graduate of Columbia University and a leader in the Palestinian rights protest movement at the school. Khalil, a Palestinian who was born in Syria, faces deportation after he was arrested on March 8, 2025, in New York City. The Department of Homeland Security said that the secretary of state had determined Khalil’s presence or activities in the country posed “serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”\n\nKhalil entered the U.S. on a student visa in 2022. In 2024, he received a green card and became a lawful permanent resident – meaning he has the legal right to work and stay in the U.S. There are an estimated 12.8 million lawful permanent residents in the country.\n\nKhalil’s lawyers say that his arrest and pending deportation are unconstitutional.\n\nIn many respects, the rights of lawful permanent residents and citizens are similar. Yet citizens and lawful permanent residents do not enjoy equal status under the law.\n\nThe Supreme Court and other courts recognize that lawful permanent residents have First Amendment rights to free speech.\n\nYet the Supreme Court upheld deporting lawful permanent residents in the 1950s based on their political activity, in particular membership in the Communist Party.\n\nSo, while lawful permanent residents may not be criminally prosecuted for their political speech or activity, what they say or write may well affect their ability to remain in the U.S., if the government determines that they are a security risk.\n\nI’m a scholar of immigration law. Here are three major differences between the rights of citizens and lawful permanent residents.\n\n1. Limited political rights\n\nLawful permanent residents are people born in other countries who can legally work and live in the U.S. for as long as they like. They may enlist in the U.S. armed forces, apply to become U.S. citizens, and are legally protected against discrimination by private employers.\n\nStates also generally cannot discriminate against lawful permanent residents – though states may require certain groups of people, such as teachers or police, to have U.S. citizenship.\n\nBetween 1820 and 1920, noncitizens routinely participated in different aspects of government, including voting, holding office and jury service in many states and territories.\n\nThese days, states and the federal government generally allow only citizens to serve on juries, hold political positions and vote. With a few exceptions, such as voting in some local elections, permanent residents are not able to do any of these things.\n\n2. Limited public benefits\n\nThe distinction between noncitizens and citizens extends to other areas of life, such as public benefits.\n\nThe Supreme Court has frequently stated, “In the exercise of its broad power over naturalization and immigration, Congress regularly makes rules that would be unacceptable if applied to citizens.”\n\nIn practice, this means that the federal government – and to a much lesser extent, states – do not offer public benefits, such as Medicaid and other kinds of government support, to lawful permanent residents and other noncitizens on the same basis as citizens.\n\nFor example, lawful permanent residents must generally wait five years before becoming eligible for certain programs intended to support low-income people, such as Supplemental Security Income and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\n\n3. Reversal of immigration status\n\nFinally, unlike citizens, lawful permanent residents can lose their legal immigration status.\n\nCongress has enacted many grounds for deporting a noncitizen, or stopping them from entering the country.\n\nSome courts have found that the U.S. government can deport a lawful permanent resident because of national security or terrorism concerns, even if the person has not committed a crime.\n\nThe Trump administration argues that they can deport lawful permanent residents like Khalil under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, which states that a lawful permanent resident can be deported if the secretary of state has reasonable ground to believe that this person “would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”\n\nThe Trump administration had initiated deportation proceedings against Khalil on this ground.\n\nU.S. law also provides that any non-citizen can be deported if the secretary of state and the attorney general jointly determine that the person is associated with terrorism, or poses a threat to the U.S. In addition, the law says an immigrant can be deported if they “endorse or espouse terrorist activity or persuades others” to endorse or espouse terrorist activity or support a terrorist organization.\n\nStill, lawful permanent residents are entitled to certain basic rights, such as retaining a lawyer to represent them in administrative hearings and court before they are deported.\n\nBy contrast, the U.S. government cannot deport a U.S. citizen for any reason. However, sometimes U.S. citizens are deported by mistake.\n\nIndeed, the Supreme Court has found that while it is constitutional to execute a military member for desertion in wartime, it would be cruel and unusual punishment to deprive them of citizenship.\n\nLegal grounds for deporting noncitizens\n\nThere have been few recent court cases testing the scope of deporting lawful permanent residents on national security grounds based on pure speech.\n\nIn 1999, the Supreme Court ruled that if a person is deportable, they are deportable – even if there is some other reason that motivated the government’s deportation proceedings, such as a suspicion that the non-citizen is involved with crime or terrorism.\n\nThe Supreme Court also then held that the government could deport non-citizens for technical visa violations, even if the case was based on the government’s belief that the non-citizens were associated with a terrorist group.\n\nThere is also some precedent arguing that deportation based on “adverse foreign policy consequences” is too broad and nonspecific to be constitutional.\n\nIndeed, Marianne Trump Barry, the sister of the president, held this opinion when she was a federal judge in the mid-1990s. But Samuel Alito, then an appeals court judge, overturned Barry’s ruling on procedural grounds in 1996.\n\nFor its part, the Supreme Court has occasionally held that very broad and indeterminate deportation grounds are “void for vagueness,” meaning so sweeping and imprecise that they are unconstitutional.",

        "full_text": "A federal judge on Wednesday halted parts of President Donald Trump’s executive order that targeted a Democratic-linked law firm.\n\nUS District Judge Beryl Howell sided with the firm Perkins Coie, which represented Hillary Clinton in 2016 and has been involved in election litigation that Trump opposed.\n\nHowell granted the firm’s request for a temporary restraining order for some sections of Trump’s order. The parts being blocked include its limitations on government contracts with clients of the firm and the potential restrictions it puts on the firm’s employees, such as bans on hiring those employees for government positions or barring their access to federal buildings.\n\nThe executive order, Howell said as she read her opinion in court for more than 30 minutes, is “a punishment for a singled-out entity being disloyal.”\n\nWhen “the Queen of Hearts yells ‘off with their heads’ for her subjects,” Howell added, that “cannot be the reality we are living under.”\n\nThe judge, an appointee of President Barack Obama, said the case also touches on larger tests of Trump’s executive authority. The executive order, she said, is an unconstitutional use of “taxpayer dollars and government resources … to pursue a personal vendetta.”\n\n“The president is certainly entitled to his own beliefs, entitled to his own causes, and entitled to his own dislikes,” Howell said. But the president cannot “bring the federal government down on his political opponents … as he has done here.”\n\n‘Chilling effect’ to legal system\n\nThe judge also said she was blocking much of Trump’s order because of the economic harm it would cause to the law firm — and the intimidating message it sent across legal industry.\n\nHowell said the order was an “extreme, unprecedented effort” and had an effect of “blizzard proportions across the legal profession.”\n\nDelivering her decision from the bench, Howell said the justice system depends on zealous advocates on all sides being able to argue for their clients.\n\n“The chilling effect of this executive order, 14230, threatens to significantly undermine the integrity of our entire legal system,” she said.\n\nDOJ argues Trump should be trusted without question\n\nThe ruling came at the end of a hearing where the top aide to the attorney general argued that the president should be trusted without question if he wants to blacklist or sanction businesses or people as he sees fit across the country.\n\nThe argument from Chad Mizelle, the chief of staff to Attorney General Pam Bondi, is one of staggering presidential power.\n\nHowell was flabbergasted by Mizelle’s argument, saying it sent “chills down my spine” to hear the president could bar all government business with a particular company or person. Howell compared that type of decision by the president to Treasury Department economic sanctions that are decided by the Office of Foreign Assets Control related to national security.\n\n“Your view is, ‘Don’t be chilled, judge. You can just trust the president to draw the right line, and yes, he has that power?’” Howell asked. “And that’s the government’s position here?”\n\n“100 percent,” Mizelle said. “The president has every right to take that action.”\n\nMizelle also argued the courts shouldn’t be able to limit the president’s authority, especially as he decides upon lawyers’ security clearances or other access questions related to national security.\n\nPerkins Coie’s lawyer Dane Butswinkas, however, said that the national security argument is a red herring, and the Trump administration’s approach refers to “a different Constitution from the one I’m familiar with.”\n\nThe firm says the order will cause top clients to drop its lawyers, and ultimately “will spell the end of the law firm,” Butswinkas said. “The president is punishing this law firm” for defending free speech.\n\nHe said that Justice Department prosecutors have canceled meetings with Perkins Coie lawyers, hurting their ability to represent clients in ongoing legal matters.\n\nHowell also said she was blocking Trump’s order because it appears to violate several Constitutional protections, including the right for defendants to choose their lawyers, and the First Amendment right to petition the government. Perkins Coie also had no warning of the executive order or chance to oppose it before the White House issued it last Thursday, violating their due process, the judge added.\n\nCNN’s Emily R. Condon and Hannah Rabinowitz contributed to this report.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.",

        "full_text": "Overwhelming majorities of Los Angeles County voters support strengthening building codes and imposing greater restrictions on home construction in high-risk areas following January’s devastating Palisades and Eaton fires, according to a new poll from the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies, co-sponsored by The Times.\n\nEighty percent of those polled backed tougher building codes to make homes more fire resistant even if doing so added to costs. Seven out of 10 wanted more regulations to curb homebuilding in wildfire-prone neighborhoods.\n\n“This is a huge event in L.A. history,” said Mark DiCamillo, poll director at UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies. “It’s having a major effect on what people think needs to be done in terms of making housing safer.”\n\nAlmost 13,000 households were displaced by the two fires, which destroyed structures on 56% of properties in Pacific Palisades and nearly half of those in Altadena.\n\nEven though implementing more robust building codes and restrictions on growth could affect Palisades and Altadena homeowners directly, voters polled in those communities supported both ideas by wide margins.\n\nBacking for stronger building codes in the Palisades and Eaton fire zones, 85% and 82% respectively in favor, eclipsed support from those outside the areas. For homebuilding limits, 65% of voters in the Palisades fire zone were supportive, as were 61% of those surveyed in the Eaton area.\n\nThese two issues are weighing heavily in Tracey Alexander’s mind as she decides whether to rebuild the home she lost in the Palisades fire.\n\nAlexander and her husband have lived for nearly three decades in the Palisades’ Alphabet Streets, a mostly flat residential area with smaller lots than in the hills. She said that she and all her neighbors would want to build back with more fire safe materials, but no one knew how much more expensive that would be. The other question she’s wrestling with is more existential.\n\n“Part of it is the economics of rebuilding,” Alexander said. “Part of it is, ‘Do I want to live in a fire zone?’ That’s something that is hard to analyze.”\n\nState and local officials have yet to decide if there will be any building code changes for rebuilt homes. Current codes for new and rebuilt properties in high-risk fire zones require significant measures, including ignition-resistant materials and multipaned or window upgrades.\n\nThe Berkeley IGS poll found broad backing for a number of policy ideas, including those that would increase taxes to pay for fire protection and build higher-density housing in urban areas.\n\nThe most popular proposal, with 84% support, was for policymakers to prioritize assistance for low- and middle-income families displaced by the fires. Pacific Palisades had some of the highest home values in Los Angeles, and those in Altadena were above the county’s median. But that’s not always indicative of fire victims’ economic status. In many cases, homes worth more than $1 million prior to the fires were purchased for less than half that amount decades ago. Additionally, a quarter of the homes lost were apartments, other multifamily housing or mobile homes.\n\nNearly two-thirds of voters polled wanted to provide greater funding for city and county fire departments even if that meant raising taxes. Voters were more evenly divided, 46% support versus 43% opposed, about the idea of creating a tax structure that would require those living in high-risk fire areas to pay more for public services.\n\n“Right now, the priority for Los Angeles residents is fire protection,” DiCamillo said. “If they’re going to support tax hikes, that’s the area.”\n\nTo compensate for restricting homebuilding in fire-prone communities, county voters backed greater production of high-density housing in urban areas, with 55% support compared to 30% opposition.\n\nThe twin findings — restraining construction in riskier neighborhoods and promoting it in safer ones — mirror prior surveys.\n\nA 2019 Berkeley IGS poll saw support from three-quarters of California voters, including 79% in L.A. County, for imposing limits on growth in wildfire areas. A poll last year from the Los Angeles Business Council Institute found 81% of city voters backed speeding approvals for apartment buildings with some affordable housing near public transit and existing high-density, urban areas.\n\nMost policy proposals did not see significant splits among age, race, gender or other demographic factors, though there were large partisan differences in the level of support for many ideas. Still, a majority of GOP voters — traditionally leery of regulation — surveyed also backed strengthening building codes and imposing more restrictions on development in high-risk neighborhoods.\n\nOne policy idea that voters disliked in the poll was allowing insurance companies to increase their rates if it enables them to offer fire coverage more broadly. More than half of those surveyed were opposed to the idea, compared to 39% in support.\n\nInsurance coverage has emerged as one of the highest-profile issues in the immediate wake of the fires. Last month, state Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara turned down a 22% emergency rate hike proposed by State Farm General, California’s largest home insurer, as the company and others have questioned whether they will remain in the state due to risks.\n\n“I can imagine insurance rates are going to be near the top of voters’ minds when it comes to cost and affordability of living in California,” DiCamillo said. “That’s where the resistance really is coming from.”\n\nThe Berkeley IGS poll was conducted online in English and Spanish on Feb. 17-26 among 5,184 registered voters in Los Angeles County. The survey’s estimated margin of error is 2 percentage points, and larger for demographic subgroups.",

The synthetic opioid drug is wrapped in foil, sealed in plastic, then dropped with an oily splash into the petrol tank of the trafficker's nondescript car.\n\nJay, not his real name, had crossed earlier from the US to this cartel-run safe house on the Mexican side of the border. The house looks like any other in this neighbourhood. We are told to drive in quickly and an iron gate closes firmly behind us. They don't cook the drug here, but still they are wary of attracting attention. The men all speak in hushed voices and work quickly.\n\nTheir lethal business has become the centre of a global economic dispute. The White House has used fentanyl smuggling through US borders as a key justification for raising tariffs on other nations. US President Donald Trump has also vowed to \"wage war\" on the drug cartels.\n\nThe BBC gained rare access to a cartel's operation along the border and travelled to the US to meet their ultimate customers, to see if the international row was doing anything to halt the illegal flow of narcotics.\n\nThe men we meet at the safe house are foot-soldiers of a well-known cartel. Two of them loading the car admit to fleeting moments of remorse. But when I ask the man packing the drugs into the fuel tank if he feels guilty about the deaths the pills cause, he sniggers. \"We have family too, of course we feel guilty. But if I stop, it's going to continue. It's not my problem,\" he tells me with a shrug.\n\nThe men keep their faces covered while they remove the back seat of the car to gain access to the tank, taking care not to spill petrol. The smell inside the car could alert customs officers on the other side of the border that the fuel tank has been tampered with.\n\nThe light green pills, 5,000 in total and marked with an M, are packed tightly - a fraction of what Jay says he sells every week in LA and across the American northwest.\n\n\"I try to get 100,000 pills a week, every week,\" the softly spoken dealer tells me. \"I don't send them in one vehicle. I try to spread it in different cars. That way I minimise my risk of losing all my pills.\"\n\nA 25% tariff on all goods from Mexico was introduced in response to what President Donald Trump said was the unacceptable flow of illegal drugs and illegal immigrants into the US. Some of those tariffs have since been delayed until 2 April.\n\nDefeating the fentanyl trade is one of President Trump's top policy goals, but Jay doesn't rate his chances.\n\n\"Last time he was in office, he tried to do the same thing, and it never happened. There's always going to be a demand. And where's the biggest demand? United States, lucky for us. We're here in the border,\" says Jay with a smile.\n\nThere is so much of the drug flowing into the US, most of it coming from Mexico, that according to Jay the price he sells it for in LA has fallen from about $5 or $6 per pill a year ago, to $1.50 now (£1.16).\n\nMexican police say cartels switched in a big way to fentanyl, which is 50 times more potent than heroin, because unlike other opiates - which are made from the opium poppy - it is completely synthetic and much easier to make and transport.\n\nFentanyl's strength and addictiveness has left a deep scar on American society: drug overdoses kill more people in the US than guns or car crashes. Fatalities have started to decline, perhaps due in part to the greater availability of Naloxone, a drug that reverses the effects of overdoses of opioids. But the latest figures are still stark: 87,000 overdose deaths (mostly from opioids) from October 2023 to September 2024, down from 114,000 the year before.\n\nIn an attempt to stave off punitive tariffs from the White House, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has pledged to send 10,000 National Guard troops to the border. The government has made more than 900 arrests since October in Sinaloa, a major drug trafficking hub. Back in December, Mexico announced its biggest ever fentanyl seizure in the state: more than a tonne of pills. In fact, the country has seized more fentanyl in the past five months than it did in the previous year.\n\nMexico has also made it harder to import a key ingredient of fentanyl from China, prompting cartels to reduce the strength of each pill - and, in the process, making them less deadly.\n\nAnd at the end of February, 29 senior drug cartel figures were handed over to the United States, including members of five of the six Mexican crime syndicates that President Trump's administration recently designated as terrorist organisations.\n\nPresident Sheinbaum also said she had agreed to the CIA increasing surveillance drone operations over Mexican territory in search of fentanyl drugs labs, after the media revealed the covert missions.\n\nJay acknowledges the dangers of his trade to himself and his customers, but is untroubled.\n\n\"They always try to blame us, that we are the ones that are poisoning American citizens. But they're the biggest users.\"\n\nHe coolly insulates himself from responsibility and guilt for the deaths his drugs cause. He claims not to know anyone who has died using his product. \"I only deal with other suppliers,\" he tells me.\n\nThe cartels mostly use American citizens to courier their drugs across the border, as they are less likely to be stopped by US Customs and Border Protection. The driver, who goes by the name Charlie, has a US passport. He, too, is mostly indifferent to the suffering the fentanyl epidemic has caused.\n\n\"I need the money,\" he says. When I ask him how many times he has made the drugs run, he replies: \"Too many.\" (I later learn that the 5,000 pills in the fuel tank made it across the border without incident.)\n\nPresident Sheinbaum has also recently emphasised the demand side of the crisis, saying the US fentanyl crisis began with the legal but \"irresponsible approval\" of painkillers, such as OxyContin, starting in the late 1990s. \"The US government should take responsibility for the opioid-consumption crisis that has caused so many deaths,\" she said at a daily news conference.\n\nOn the other side of the border is Derek Maltz, who has spent a lifetime in US drug enforcement. He has been made the interim leader of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and spoke to me just before his appointment.\n\n\"The Mexican cartels need to know that we're coming down there,\" he tells me. \"We're going to have aggressive operations to go after you and your business because you are killing our American kids at record levels and it's not going to be tolerated.\"\n\nMr Maltz agrees, though, that targeting the cartels alone will not solve the opioid crisis. \"The cartels are very bad guys,\" he tells me. \"They're transnational criminals. They're narco-terrorists. However, there is a bad demand problem in America, we have to address why our population is turning to drugs for help.\"\n\nIn Philadelphia's Kensington neighbourhood - dubbed the largest open-air drugs market on the US east coast - Rosalind Pichardo of Operation Save Our City is on to her second Bible. She records in the book's back pages the number of times she has reversed an opioid overdose using the quick-acting drug Naloxone.\n\nFor the past six years, the figure totals 2,931. She flicks through the pages and that number written in red comes alive with the memories of the individuals she saved, and the ones she lost.\n\nShe begins to list: \"Male in his 60s… male 30s… female in her 30s, very thin, no hair.\" Beside each name in this roll-call of fentanyl victims, is the number of doses of Naloxone - sold under the name Narcan - she used to attempt to revive people.\n\nMs Pichardo, who runs a drop-in centre called Sunshine House, operates what she calls a \"no-judgement zone\". She bristles at the terms like \"addict\", \"junkie\" or \"zombie\", which have been used to describe the people of her neighbourhood. Instead, she calls everyone \"sunshine\".\n\nSome she doesn't remember; others she will never forget.\n\n\"Look at this one, seven years old, two Narcans,\" she points out. Ms Pichardo had been called to a neighbour's house where a woman was holding in her arms a child who had turned blue. Ms Pichardo went inside and the girl was placed on the floor, but as she entered the child's father ran upstairs carrying a bag. \"I'm thinking if that was my child, I'd be running to help the child,\" she recalls.\n\nAt first, she thought it might be epilepsy, but she spotted drug scales and plastic baggies on a nearby table. The kid's dad was a drug dealer; the seven-year-old had been poisoned by his stash and overdosed. \"I was livid,\" she says.\n\nThose two doses of Narcan were enough to save the child's life.\n\nOn another page, a woman, six months pregnant, two doses of Narcan. She also survived.\n\nIn Kensington, drugs are cheap and plentiful, and people shoot up in the open. As she walks the neighbourhood, Ms Pichardo finds people passed out on the pavement, a woman in a stupor with her trousers down, a man lying prone next to a metro turnstile, another man in a wheelchair, his eyes closed and money in his hands.\n\nHe, like a growing number of opioid users, has had a limb amputated. A new drug on the street, the animal tranquilliser Xylazine, is being mixed with fentanyl. It leads to open wounds which become infected. The air is rank in places.\n\nJohn White is 56 years old, and for 40 of those years he has struggled with addiction. At Sunshine House, Ms Pichardo serves him a bowl of homemade soup.\n\n\"I've been in this city all my life,\" he says. \"The fentanyl and opioid epidemic is the worst I've ever seen. Fentanyl will get you so hooked that you have to get more. So they put it in everything.\"\n\nMr White had a fentanyl overdose after smoking a joint laced with the drug: it is being added to all kinds of illicit drugs, including heroin, cocaine and marijuana.\n\nMs Pichardo holds out little hope that even if the fentanyl trade is cut off from Mexico, it will improve people's lives in Kensington.\n\n\"The problem that we have with the war on drugs is - it didn't work then [and] I don't believe it's going to work now,\" she explains.\n\nWhen the supply of one drug is cut off, another replaces it, she says. \"Once there was heroin, now there's no more. Now there's fentanyl. When there's no fentanyl, now it's going to be Xylazine. So it's like they'll find a way to keep people addicted so that people can make money off of people, off the suffering of people,\" says Ms Pichardo.\n\nDirectly across from Sunshine House, a young woman is found collapsed on the pavement, her body splayed across the concrete: she's unresponsive. Ms Pichardo is quickly on the scene, her medical kit by her side, yet again administering Naloxone. The woman is eventually revived - she will survive.\n\nRoz Pichardo returns to Sunshine House, another life saved and another digit to be added to the back pages of her tattered Bible.\n\nTop picture: Darren Conway, BBC",

        "full_text": "(NewsNation) — A judge heard arguments Wednesday about the arrest of a former Columbia University student who helped lead pro-Palestinian protests on campus.\n\nMahmoud Khalil, born in Syria and raised in a Palestinian refugee camp, holds legal permanent resident status in the United States. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested Khalil on Saturday and transferred him to a detention center in Louisiana.\n\nKhalil will remain detained in Louisiana until at least next week following the initial court hearing in New York on Wednesday over the Trump administration’s plans to deport him for his role in campus protests against Israel.\n\nThe hearing focused on jurisdictional issues after Khalil, 30, was moved to the detention center in the South.\n\nGovernment attorneys want his case decided in New Jersey or Louisiana, while his lawyers seek to return it to New York and have him released under supervision.\n\nKhalil’s wife, a U.S. citizen who is eight months pregnant, attended the hearing. His legal team claims they have been unable to contact him since his detention and later accused the administration of violating his free speech rights.\n\nThe hearing is the first challenge to President Donald Trump’s January executive order prohibiting antisemitism on college campuses and using that as justification for deportation.\n\nAccording to Khalil’s lawyer, Amy Greer, ICE officers said his student visa was revoked under Trump’s executive order. When Khalil showed them he was not in the country on a student visa but rather as a legal permanent resident, the officers said that was also revoked, Greer said.\n\n“I think we ought to get them all out of the country,” Trump said about Khalil’s arrest Tuesday. “They’re troublemakers, they’re agitators. They don’t love our country. We ought to get them the hell out. I think that guy — I heard his statements too. They were plenty bad, and I think we had to get him the hell out of the country.”\n\nTrump’s border czar Tom Homan, on a Wednesday trip to the New York state Capitol, said Khalil was arrested because there are “limitations” to free speech.\n\n“I hear freedom of speech, freedom of speech, freedom of speech. Can you stand in a movie theater and yell ‘fire’? Can you slander somebody verbally? Free speech has limitations,” Homan said.\n\nKhalil’s lawyer argues that ICE’s actions violate his First Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nA federal judge in Manhattan blocked Khalil’s deportation earlier this week. Khalil is a green card holder, which allows him due process rights under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nWhat did Mahmoud Khalil do during the Columbia protests?\n\nKhalil finished his requirements for a Columbia master’s degree in December.\n\nColumbia became the center of a U.S. pro-Palestinian protest movement that swept across college campuses nationwide last year and led to more than 2,000 arrests.\n\nHe acted as a spokesperson for Columbia protesters and hasn’t been charged with a crime. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that the administration moved to deport him under a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that gives the secretary of state the power to deport a noncitizen on foreign policy grounds.\n\nCan ICE take away Mahmoud Khalil’s green card?\n\nKhalil was one of the most visible activists at Columbia University’s pro-Palestinian rallies in 2024. The Department of Homeland Security has accused him of “leading activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.”\n\nThe agency is sanctioned to initiate deportation proceedings against green card holders for a broad range of alleged criminal activity.\n\nBut according to immigration experts, the detention of a legal permanent resident who has not been charged with a crime marked an extraordinary move with an uncertain legal foundation.\n\n“I would gather that anyone that has a political view or has protested and also has a green card would be nervous,” Rosanna Berardi, managing partner at Berardi Immigration Law, told NewsNation.\n\n“If this is any indication of the administration’s position on green card holders that their own agency vetted at a super-high level and gave a green card … and this is the behavior of the administration, I would be gravely concerned,” Berardi said.\n\nNewsNation has reached out to Khalil’s lawyer, the Justice Department, DHS and Columbia University for comment but has not yet heard back.\n\nMahmoud Khalil case first ‘of many to come’\n\nTrump himself said Khalil’s arrest was the first of many during his second term. The administration is not only targeting students who participated in protests but also the universities themselves.\n\nThe Department of Education sent letters to 60 universities warning they were under investigation for alleged antisemitic discrimination and harassment for allowing pro-Palestinian protests to occur on school grounds.\n\nFollowing the letters, the University of California, Los Angeles — the site of a large pro-Khalil protest Tuesday — announced it is starting a new initiative to combat antisemitism on campus.\n\nThe Trump administration has already canceled $400 million worth of grants to Columbia University as of Friday. The school’s response to pro-Palestinian protests on its New York City campus was explicitly cited as the reason behind the funding changes.\n\nHarvard University announced a faculty and staff hiring freeze Monday due to “substantial financial uncertainties driven by rapidly shifting federal policies.”\n\nDetaining of Columbia grad is suppression of First Amendment: Geraldo Rivera\n\nGeraldo Rivera argued that moving Khalil to Louisiana reveals the government’s true motives in the case.\n\n“The fact that they secreted him off to Louisiana, of all places, in the dark of night really reveals the motive of ICE and the federal agents — they want to silence this person,” Rivera said.\n\nRivera also acknowledged concerns about antisemitism on college campuses since October 7, calling it a “vile kind of confrontation” and “harassment of Jewish students.” However, he characterized the government’s handling of Khalil’s case as “ham-handed” and problematic.\n\n“This really looks bad. It looks as if they’re trying to suppress his First Amendment rights,” Rivera said.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters that Khalil’s case is “not about free speech.”\n\n“This is about people that don’t have a right to be in the United States to begin with. No one has a right to a student visa. No one has a right to a green card,” Rubio said.\n\nRivera pushed back, saying there’s “absolutely zero evidence that this particular person screamed anything at anybody, blocked anybody from anything, behaved in any way that would violate either local laws or federal law.”\n\nRivera, who identified himself as a supporter of Israel, said, “I’m a Zionist, but still, I’m also an American, and I’m proud of my Constitution, and I abhor this attempt to silence this person.”\n\n“If you’re so confident in your case, why is he in Louisiana?” Rivera asked. “What connection does this case add to Louisiana other than the fact that you want to inconvenience anyone who wants to talk to him and keep him in isolation?”\n\nNewsNation’s Damita Menezes and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

        "full_text": "Authored by Paul D. Thacker via The DisInformation Chronicle,\n\nI had the pleasure of being contacted by Reuters Fact Check last week, with a demand that I explain and justify a headline on a story I wrote about COVID vaccines. I immediately started laughing.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, I should probably explain Reuters Fact Check first.\n\nReuters Fact Check is one of the many disreputable fact-check organizations that Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg cut ties with in January because, in his words, “The fact checkers have been too politically biased and destroyed more trust than they created, especially in the US.” At the time, Zuckerberg cut financial links with Reuters Fact Check and about two-thirds of the entire fact checking industry.\n\nZuckerberg began to change his tune about fact checking last May after House Republicans released Meta’s internal communications. Zuckerberg and other Meta executive were exposed complaining in texts and emails that the Biden White House pressured them to censor COVID topics, and they discussed fact checkers falsely labeling some posts as false.\n\nReuters launched their fact checking initiative in partnership with Meta back in 2020, claiming in a press release, “Reuters has a superior track record in sourcing, verifying and clearing user-generated content for distribution to thousands of clients globally and we are best placed in using our in-house expertise to fact check social media content.”\n\nWell, not really. Like all the fact check organizations, Reuters fact checks narratives, not facts. But before getting into any details, let’s wind the clock back to 2022 when Dr. Kerryn Phelps testified before the Australian Parliament about her COVID vaccine injury.\n\n“Regulators of the medical profession have censored public discussion about adverse events following immunisation,” Phelps testified, “with threats to doctors not to make any public statements about anything that ‘might undermine the government’s vaccine rollout’ or risk suspension or loss of their registration.”\n\nLaying out the details of how the COVID vaccine harmed her and her wife, Phelps explained that medical professionals dismissed vaccine injury, a point driven home by the venue for her testimony: an Australian government inquiry, not on vaccine injury, but on Long COVID. Phelps’ credentials made it hard for fact checkers and pharma friendly reporters to shoot her down. She is a conjoint professor at the NICM Health Research Institute, the first woman elected president of the Australian Medical Association (AMA), and a former member of the Australian Parliament.\n\nWhat became clear at the time, however, is that people injured by the COVID vaccine would only be taken seriously if they discussed their symptoms as a type of Long COVID. A group of Australian patients injured by the COVID vaccine called COVERSE submitted testimony to Australian Parliament that adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines could be mistaken for Long COVID, given significant overlap in symptoms.\n\nThis second point was further underlined in Brianne Dressen’s book Worth a Shot?: Secrets of the Clinical Trial Participant Who Inspired a Global Movement. Dressen recounts participating in a U.S. COVID vaccine clinical trial only to be vaccine injured. Some of her story was documented in a Science Magazine article on the NIH’s investigation of COVID vaccine injuries.\n\nDressen later founded the advocacy group, React 19, for patients harmed by COVID vaccine, and describes in her book how many vaccine injured patients are misdiagnosed with Long COVID.\n\nDressen is also one of the 28 authors on the preprint I covered that discussed patients who had been harmed by the COVID vaccine: “Yale Researchers Find COVID Spike Protein in Blood 709 Days After Vaccination, Positing Millions of Long COVID Patients May Actually Be Vaccine Injured.”\n\nMy headline triggered an anonymous writer for Reuters Fact Check to contact me demanding an explanation:\n\nThe senior authors of the paper and independent experts we consulted all refuted that claim, saying there is no such evidence or conclusion in the study.\n\nWe wanted to offer you the opportunity to comment on whether you stand by your article and, if possible, to point us to any evidence in the paper that supports your assertion.\n\nI started laughing at first, as Reuters Fact Check has a tattered history with numerous fact checks undermined by scientific research as well as the very Yale study they were citing and that I had reported on. Here’s how I responded to Reuters in email:\n\nMY EMAIL TO REUTERS:\n\nReuters Fact Check falsely asserted, “The mRNA instructs cells to make the [spike] protein and is broken down by the body shortly thereafter” although the new study found “spike in circulation up to 709 days after vaccination.” When does Reuters Fact Check plan to correct this falsehood in accordance with what is reported in this new study?\n\nReuters Fact Check asserted, “There is no proof that spike proteins created in response to mRNA vaccines are harmful to the body.” However, the new study reported:\n\nInteraction with full-length S, its subunits (S1, S2), and/or peptide fragments with host molecules may result in prolonged symptoms in certain individuals. Recently, a subset of non-classical monocytes has been shown to harbor S protein in patients with PVS. Further, biodistribution studies on mRNA–LNP platforms in animal models indicate its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, and the local S expression could result in neurocognitive symptoms.\n\nWhen does Reuters Fact Check plan to correct this falsehood in accordance with what is reported in this new study?\n\nI spoke for several hours on background with one of the paper's 28 authors, so who is Reuters Fact Check speaking with?\n\nDid you notice that each time I caught Reuters with a fake fact check, their mistakes always favored the pharmaceutical industry? Well, Reuters Fact Check never responded to me. Instead, Reuters posted a fake fact check that never bothered to quote anything I sent them. Nor did Reuters go back and correct their fake fact checks from the past. And their fake headline attacked something that was never claimed.\n\nNobody I’m aware of, nor anyone I have spoken with thinks “Long COVID is a vaccine injury” as Reuters falsely contends. But with tens of millions of Americans reported to have Long COVID, some subset of these patients are likely vaccine injured.\n\nReuters Fact Check simply made up a claim, debunked it, and proclaimed victory. This is exactly how another former Meta fact checker, Leadstories.com, behaved when they did a fake fact check of a BMJ investigation that exposed problems with Pfizer’s COVID clinical trial.\n\nI spoke to Dr. Danice Hertz, another of the study authors, to get her views on fake fact checks and why so many medical professionals have politicized the issue of vaccines. “Up until this moment, vaccine injury was not acknowledged,” Hertz told me. “And there’s been a concerted effort to cover it up.”\n\nA couple weeks after Zuckerberg cut ties in January with biased fact checkers like Reuters, he sat for an interview with Joe Rogan and complained that Meta was pressured to censor anything on vaccine side effects.\n\n“Who’s pressuring you take down things that talk about vaccine side effects,” Rogan asked.",

        "full_text": "“Our caucus is unified” on such a measure to “keep the government open and give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan legislation that can pass,” Mr. Schumer said in a brief statement from the floor.\n\nThe announcement left congressional leaders without a clear path to avert a shutdown that would begin at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday should Congress fail to act by then to extend federal funding. Senate Republicans would need the support of at least eight Democrats to overcome procedural hurdles and bring a spending measure to a final vote. Just one, Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, has so far declared he would vote to break any filibuster.\n\nThe standoff puts Senate Democrats at risk of being blamed for any shutdown even as they complain about Trump administration disruptions to federal agencies. But they are under pressure from House Democrats and activists to stand against Mr. Trump and Elon Musk as they lead an effort to dismantle broad swaths of the federal bureaucracy, in some cases in direct defiance of Congress, which holds the power of the purse.\n\nWith two days left before the shutdown deadline, there is still time for a reversal by Democrats. But most of them have heaped criticism on Republicans’ stopgap spending measure, arguing that it would give Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk too much leeway to continue their unilateral efforts to slash government employees and programs.\n\nRepublicans, who control both chambers, have shown no willingness to compromise with Democrats on the spending measure. And even if they agreed to, changing the House bill or approving a different one would require the House to return and vote again, which is highly unlikely. Republican leaders deliberately adjourned the chamber on Tuesday night and left town after passing the spending legislation, known as a continuing resolution, to effectively force the Senate to accept it.\n\nThe private meetings this week have laid bare a major dilemma for Democrats as they wrestle with how to respond to the Republican legislation. Senators said they had two unappealing alternatives. They could oppose the G.O.P. plan and potentially take the blame for a damaging federal shutdown or surrender to Mr. Trump and incite the wrath of Democrats demanding that their representatives thwart the White House at every turn.\n\n“There are really only two options,” said Senator Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats. “One is to vote for a pretty bad C.R., or the other is to vote for a potentially even worse shutdown. It is a very tough choice.”\n\nEven as Mr. Schumer declared his party’s opposition, Democrats privately continued to deliberate over a way to avoid a shutdown without appearing to capitulate to Mr. Trump. Some suggested allowing the stopgap spending bill to move forward as long as Republicans agreed to give them a chance to revise it on the Senate floor. That would afford Democrats the chance to make their political case against the measure and show that they were fighting it, even if their proposals for changes ultimately failed.\n\nBut as House Democratic leaders gathered for a retreat in Virginia on Wednesday, they pleaded with their Senate counterparts to follow their lead and oppose the government funding bill outright.\n\nRepresentative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, called the measure “a power grab that further unleashes and entrenches Elon Musk’s efforts.” He applauded his caucus for sticking together on Tuesday in voting against it and sending a clear message of repudiation for its policies on the House floor. All but one Democrat opposed the measure in the House.\n\nIn the Senate, virtually all Democrats are opposed to the stopgap bill, which cleared the House largely along party lines on Tuesday. They view it as an abdication of congressional power and a woefully inefficient way of funding the government while providing Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk more opportunity to slice into federal agencies. They also noted that it broke from an earlier bipartisan deal on both domestic and military spending.\n\n“Instead of writing a bill that gives our communities what they need, they wrote a bill that turns many of our accounts into slush funds,” said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. The bill, she added, “gives the final say over what gets funding to two billionaires who don’t know the first thing about the needs of our working families.”\n\nShe and her fellow Senate Democrats would much prefer to pass the individual spending bills that have been negotiated between the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Appropriations Committees. But House Republicans pulled back from those talks in favor of the decision to freeze most funding through Sept. 30, leaving only two remaining possibilities: blocking the spending bill or approving it.\n\nSenator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, said Democrats should not give in “just because the House decided to leave town on a Tuesday night.”\n\n“That doesn’t mean the Senate shouldn’t be a deliberative body,” he added.\n\nDespite their opposition to the spending plan, top Democrats are leery of forcing the government into a shutdown, fearing the political blowback after years of castigating Republicans for shutdowns.\n\nIn addition, Democrats worried that a shutdown would play into the hands of Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk, empowering them to keep hollowing out federal agencies. Democrats also argued that it remained unclear how any shutdown would end once it began. And they conceded that it could undercut their criticism of the Department of Government Efficiency as an out-of-control buzz saw shredding the government, if they were the ones refusing to extend funding for federal agencies.\n\nRepublicans were already trying to take advantage of their predicament.\n\n“If I listen to our colleagues across the aisle, they claim to have a lot of concern for the federal workers that depend on government funding,” said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas. “So I find interesting that so many of them in the House cast a vote that would put thousands, even hundreds of thousands, of federal workers out of work.”\n\nRelenting to Republicans was certain to inflame House Democrats and advocacy groups who were demanding that Senate Democrats remain united against the legislation.\n\nMore than 150 progressive and environmental groups on Wednesday sent Senate Democratic leaders a letter urging them to “stand strong until Musk and Trump stop their illegal actions to dismantle key federal programs.”\n\nAt least one Democrat said causing a shutdown would clear the way for additional harm.\n\n“If any of those groups want to shut the government down, I would disagree with them,” Mr. Fetterman said. “It wasn’t that long ago that we were lecturing Republicans who were threatening to shut the government down. Now I think we are in the same situation.”\n\nDemocrats have excoriated Republicans, saying they acted irresponsibly in shuttering federal agencies in past funding fights.\n\nMr. Schumer and his fellow Democrats did prompt a shutdown in 2018 as they sought to win protections for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children. But they capitulated after a brief weekend closure, when lawmakers concluded that the strategy was backfiring and angering the public.\n\nThey have sought to make certain they were not blamed in any government funding lapses since then.\n\nAnnie Karni contributed reporting from Leesburg, Va.\n\nThe suit accused employees of Southwest Key, which has worked with the federal government for more than two decades, of exploiting “children’s vulnerabilities, language barriers and distance from family and loved ones” from 2015 through at least 2023, including President Trump’s first term.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi, in the statement, blamed the Biden administration’s immigration policies for enabling the abuses.\n\n“Under the border policies of the previous administration, bad actors were incentivized to exploit children and break our laws: this ends now,” Ms. Bondi said, adding, “securing our border and protecting children from abuse are among the most critical missions of the Department of Justice and the Trump administration.”\n\nAnais Biera Miracle, a spokeswoman for Southwest Key, maintained the nonprofit denied the claims of abuse. She said it was “pleased” that the Justice Department had dropped the case in its entirety, and that charges cannot be refiled.\n\n“There is no settlement or payment required,” Ms. Miracle said in an email. “We are glad this matter is now concluded.”\n\nAbuse and harassment were also alleged to have taken place during President Trump’s first term, including during his policy of family separation, which forced thousands of additional minors into federal custody. In a complaint filed in July, federal prosecutors reported that Southwest Key employees subjected minors to threats of violence to prevent them from reporting rape, solicitations of sex and entreaties for nude photographs, among other inappropriate conduct and abuse for at least eight years, across three presidential administrations.\n\nAt the time the complaint was filed, the H.H.S., which assumes responsibility for housing children who arrive at the southern border unaccompanied by parents or legal guardians, continued to place minors at shelters run by Southwest Key even as prosecutors asked that the nonprofit face penalties and that it pay damages to the victims.\n\nThe decision appears to conclude a gradual reversal of fortune for Southwest Key, which has worked with the federal government for more than two decades, operating more than 25 shelters across Texas, Arizona and California. It has been awarded more than $6 billion in federal funds since 2007. After the H.H.S. announced that it would review its grants to Southwest Key, Ms. Miracle, the spokeswoman, said that the government had frozen funding and put in place a stop placement order on Southwest Key shelters, forcing the nonprofit to furlough about 5,000 employees.\n\nHousing underage migrants for the federal government has been a financial boon for contractors like Southwest Key, whose award money more than doubled during the family separation policy overseen by Mr. Trump in 2017 and 2018. It was one of several providers that cashed in as the administration scrambled to find shelter for more than 5,000 children forced into federal custody, turning the care of migrant children into a billion-dollar business with little transparency.\n\nThe New York Times revealed in 2018 that Southwest Key had funneled government money through a web of for-profit companies to convert public funds into private money for the organization and pay top executives millions of dollars. Shortly after, the Justice Department opened an investigation into possible financial improprieties. Southwest Key also began an internal inquiry, and high-level executives, including its founder and chief financial officer, eventually resigned.\n\nThe complaint filed by the Justice Department last year disclosed that Southwest Key had documented dozens of cases of abuse reported by children, the majority of whom were 13 to 17 and came from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. But Southwest Key’s employees did not report abuse they had observed or knew of, or any violations of policies intended to protect minors.\n\nBy one account, a worker who sexually abused three girls ages 5, 8 and 11 threatened to kill their families if they told. In another case documented by Southwest Key, a supervisor deliberately changed shifts to be alone with a teenage girl he repeatedly raped, abused and threatened. At night, he would enter her bedroom and those of others in violation of Southwest Key’s policies. The girl was transferred to a different shelter after she reported the abuse.\n\nAt the time, a spokeswoman for Southwest Key said that the complaint did not “present the accurate picture of the care and commitment our employees provide to the youth and children,” and that the company remained focused on “the safety, health and well-being” of the children at its shelters.\n\nThe subpoena requested testimony and evidence from the hotel related to “an alleged violation” of federal immigration law. It asked the hotel for the names of entities and individuals responsible for the “funding and management of the illegal immigrant/migrant shelter program,” as well as any contracts or agreements related to it.\n\nIt was unclear why prosecutors sent a subpoena to the Chandler, a hotel on East 31st Street that was converted into a homeless shelter years ago but does not operate as a shelter for migrants.\n\nThe investigation appears focused at least in part on the management and funding of hotels acting as shelters, but its full scope was unclear as of Wednesday, as was whether other hotels had received subpoenas.\n\nThe grand jury subpoena was issued by the office of the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. A spokesman for the office, Nicholas Biase, referred questions to the Department of Justice in Washington. A spokesman there declined to comment on what he said was “an ongoing criminal investigation,” adding that he could not discuss the scope or contours of the inquiry.\n\nNew York City, which is housing about 43,000 migrants in shelters across the city, including dozens of converted hotels, had not received a subpoena as of Wednesday, according to an official briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter.\n\nLiz Garcia, a spokeswoman for Mayor Eric Adams, declined to comment, saying, “We cannot comment on any type of federal investigation.”\n\nThe Guardian first reported on Wednesday that a Manhattan hotel, which they did not name, had received a subpoena.\n\nThe city’s migrant shelters have been criticized and scrutinized by the Trump administration, which has made New York City, the country’s largest sanctuary jurisdiction, a target of its immigration crackdown.\n\nThe city entered into multimillion-dollar contracts with more than 100 hotels as it struggled to house the more than 230,000 migrants who have arrived in the city seeking shelter since early 2022. Republicans have long decried the use of hotels as shelters to house migrants as wasteful spending of taxpayer funding.\n\nLast month, the Trump administration abruptly clawed back $80 million in federal funds from the city’s bank accounts that was meant to cover some expenses associated with paying hotels to shelter migrants.\n\nIn doing so, the federal government singled out the Roosevelt Hotel in Midtown, which the city had converted into its main processing center for migrants. The Trump administration depicted it as a safe haven for migrant gangs. Shortly after, the city announced it would shut down the Roosevelt Hotel by June, citing a sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in the city.\n\nWilliam K. Rashbaum contributed reporting, and Sheelagh McNeill contributed research.\n\nThe spokeswoman, McLaurine Pinover, is not the only member of the Trump administration to have used her federal office to promote outside business interests, but former agency officials and ethics watchdogs say that the timing and content of the videos were both unlawful and especially tone-deaf.\n\nGovernment watchdogs say the videos, coming from the spokeswoman of the agency driving the layoffs of thousands of federal workers, exemplify a widespread disregard for government ethics across the Trump administration.\n\n“It’s illegal for a public employee to promote a private company in their government office,” said Donald Sherman, the executive director and chief counsel for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government watchdog group.\n\n“On its own, maybe it would qualify as small potatoes, but context matters,” Mr. Sherman added. “In the context of a president and an administration that are routinely engaged in profiteering and using the office of the presidency for financial gain, in the context of someone who owns a private company, Elon Musk, coming into the administration and dismantling the government as he has, and in the context of O.P.M. being central to the administration’s attack on civil servants who actually want to be there to work for the American public, an O.P.M. political appointee engaging in this conduct is egregious.”\n\nThough presidents are legally exempt from certain conflict of interest laws, President Trump has not divested from many business interests, some of which involve real estate deals with foreign governments that could influence his diplomatic decisions. Mr. Musk, the tech billionaire whom Mr. Trump deputized to slash the federal government, continues to pursue federal contracts for his private businesses.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, the day news of Ms. Pinover’s Instagram account broke, Mr. Trump made a show of purchasing a red Model S from Tesla, of which Mr. Musk is chief executive, on the White House grounds, just a day after the company’s stock crashed.\n\nMs. Pinover’s short videos, each four to nine seconds, featured her in her office, lightheartedly modeling her clothes, applying makeup, working at her desk and occasionally blowing a kiss to the camera. They also included links to the clothes that would give her a commission from fans’ purchases.\n\nThe existence of Ms. Pinover’s accounts was first reported by CNN. The Instagram account has since been deleted, while the account that would supply commissions, ShopMy, has been wiped clean, save for Ms. Pinover’s name and picture and an invitation to “Shop my looks!”\n\nIn a statement, Ms. Pinover said she never made any money from the fashion videos.\n\n“While I was battling breast cancer as a new mom, I felt so unlike myself. I turned to social media shortly after as a personal outlet,” she wrote. “I never made any income and with only about 800 followers, I’m surprised the so-called ‘newspaper of record’ finds this newsworthy. My focus remains on serving the American people at O.P.M.”\n\nWhether she actually profited off the enterprise is irrelevant, Mr. Sherman said. The purpose of the account was to promote the clothing.\n\nMs. Pinover took on her role in the Trump administration in January, but her Instagram account — and the start of her fashion influencer videos — predated that job. Before she joined the Trump administration, she worked as a senior director for the Herald Group, a communications and advocacy firm, starting in August 2023. Before that, Ms. Pinover was a spokeswoman for Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nFormer O.P.M. employees said that Ms. Pinover should have been warned against pursuing supplementary income streams, particularly on government property, as part of a standard ethics briefing employees receive when joining the agency.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Ms. Pinover had been explicitly warned against such activity when she started the job. White House representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n“Use of public property to film one’s ‘fashion influencer’ videos should raise lots of ethical questions about how seriously the Trump administration is taking their oaths,” said Viet Tran, the deputy communications director of O.P.M. during the Biden administration, a political appointment. “Whether it’s Trump hawking Teslas on the South Lawn, SpaceX employees meddling in competitor contracts at F.A.A., or using your government offices for personal enrichment, it looks awful all around.”\n\n“From the campaign trail to Day 1 and beyond, President Trump has delivered on his promise to unleash energy dominance and lower the cost of living,” Mr. Zeldin said. “We at E.P.A. will do our part to power the great American comeback.”\n\nNowhere in the video did he refer to protecting the environment or public health, twin tenets that have guided the agency since its founding in 1970.\n\nThe E.P.A. has “no obligation to promote agriculture or commerce; only the critical obligation to protect and enhance the environment,” the first administrator, William D. Ruckelshaus, said as he explained its mission to the country weeks after the E.P.A. was created by President Richard M. Nixon. He said the agency would be focused on research, standards and enforcement in five areas: air pollution, water pollution, waste disposal, radiation and pesticides.\n\nMr. Zeldin said the E.P.A. would unwind more than two dozen protections against air and water pollution. It would overturn limits on soot from smokestacks that have been linked to respiratory problems in humans and premature deaths as well as restrictions on emissions of mercury, a neurotoxin. It would get rid of the “good neighbor rule” that requires states to address their own pollution when it’s carried by winds into neighboring states. And it would eliminate enforcement efforts that prioritize the protection of poor and minority communities.\n\nIn addition, when the agency creates environmental policy, it would no longer consider the costs to society from wildfires, droughts, storms and other disasters that might be made worse by pollution connected to that policy, Mr. Zeldin said.\n\nIn perhaps its most consequential act, the agency said it would work to erase the E.P.A.’s legal authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by reconsidering decades of science that show global warming is endangering humanity. In his video, Mr. Zeldin derisively referred to that legal underpinning as “the holy grail of the climate change religion.”\n\nMr. Zeldin called Wednesday’s actions “the largest deregulatory announcement in U.S. history.” He added, “today the green new scam ends, as the E.P.A. does its part to usher in a golden age of American success.”\n\nThe announcements do not carry the force of law. In almost every case, the E.P.A. would have to undergo a lengthy process of public comment and develop environmental and economic justifications for the change.\n\nPresident Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, campaigned on a promise to “drill, baby, drill” and ease regulations on fossil fuel companies. Since returning to the White House, he has degraded the government’s capacity to fight global warming by freezing funds for climate programs authorized by Congress, firing scientists working on weather and climate forecasts, and cutting federal support for the transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nThe United States is the world’s largest historic emitter of carbon dioxide, a planet-warming greenhouse gas that scientists agree is driving climate change and intensifying hurricanes, floods, wildfires and droughts, as well as species extinction. Last year was the hottest in recorded history, and the United States experienced 27 disasters that each cost at least $1 billion, compared to three in 1980, adjusted for inflation.\n\nDemocrats and environmental activists decried Mr. Zeldin’s moves and accused him of abandoning the E.P.A.’s responsibility to protect human health and the environment.\n\n“Today is the day Trump’s Big Oil megadonors paid for,” Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, said. He called the E.P.A. moves a series of attacks on clean air, clean water and affordable energy. “Administrator Zeldin clearly lied when he told us that he would respect the science and listen to the experts,” Mr. Whitehouse said, referring to Mr. Zeldin’s confirmation hearing.\n\nGina McCarthy, who served as E.P.A. administrator in the Obama administration, said it was “the most disastrous day in EPA history. Rolling these rules back is not just a disgrace, it’s a threat to all of us. The agency has fully abdicated its mission to protect Americans’ health and well being.”\n\nJackie Wong, senior vice president for climate change and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said repealing or weakening regulations on automobiles, power plants and more would lead to increases in asthma, heart attacks and other health problems. “At a time when millions of Americans are trying to rebuild after horrific wildfires and climate-fueled hurricanes, it’s nonsensical to try to deny that climate change harms our health and welfare,” said Ms. Wong, whose organization successfully sued the first Trump administration repeatedly over environmental rollbacks.\n\nThe Trump administration had been signaling for months that it would reverse many of the climate regulations enacted during the Biden administration. But the cascade of announcements, timed with an op-ed by Mr. Zeldin in The Wall Street Journal and the online video, was designed to attract attention before he is expected to address oil, gas and other energy providers at an annual gathering in Houston.\n\nBy midafternoon, the agency had counted 31 pronouncements that were designed, Mr. Zeldin said, to “unleash American energy.”\n\nThe top lobbying groups for the automobile, oil, gas and chemical industries, among others, applauded Mr. Zeldin’s plans.\n\nAnne Bradbury, the chief executive of the American Exploration & Production Council, a lobbying group representing oil and gas companies, called the announcements “common sense.” John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the auto lobby, said the changes would keep the industry “globally competitive.”\n\nMarty Durbin, a senior vice president at the United States Chamber of Commerce, said, “American businesses were crippled with an unprecedented regulatory onslaught during the previous Administration that contributed to higher costs felt by families around the country.” He said “The Chamber supports a more balanced regulatory approach that will protect the environment and support greater economic growth.”\n\nGroups that deny the established science of climate change also cheered Mr. Zeldin’s actions.\n\n“The Biden E.P.A. ignored the will of Congress, infringed on individual freedom, trampled on property rights and tried to force the country to use unreliable sources of electricity, such as wind and solar,” said a statement from Daren Bakst, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a think tank allied with the fossil fuel industry that believes global warming has been minimal and is good for humanity and the biosphere.\n\nSome of the most significant policy changes Mr. Zeldin said he planned include:\n\nRolling back restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. Currently the E.P.A. requires existing coal-burning power plants and new gas plants built in the United States to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions by 90 percent by 2039.\n\nRewriting tailpipe pollution standards that were designed to ensure that the majority of new passenger cars and light trucks sold in the United States are all-electric or hybrids by 2032.\n\nEasing limits on mercury emissions from power plants, as well as restrictions on soot and haze from burning coal. A Biden-era rule had aimed to slash by 70 percent emissions from coal-burning power plants of mercury, which has been linked to developmental damage in children.\n\nGreatly reducing the “social cost” of carbon, an economic estimate of the damage caused by each additional ton of carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere. That figure plays a significant role in weighing the costs and benefits of regulating industries.\n\nPerhaps the most significant move, though, is an effort to revise a 2009 legal opinion known as the E.P.A. “endangerment finding” which concluded that rising greenhouse gas emissions are a danger to public health. The finding gives the agency the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Eliminating it would make it virtually impossible for the E.P.A. to curb climate pollution from automobiles, factories, power plants or oil and gas wells.\n\nReversing the rule has long been the white whale for climate deniers. But doing so would require Mr. Trump’s E.P.A. to make and substantiate the argument that greenhouse gas emissions pose no foreseeable threats to public health, when decades of science says otherwise.\n\nJonathan H. Adler, a conservative legal expert and professor of environmental law at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, said he did not believe the Trump administration would succeed. “You’ve got to explain away decades of statements by every administration that there are negative consequences of climate change that can be reasonably anticipated,” Mr. Adler said.\n\nHe called the effort to unravel the endangerment finding “a good way to waste years of time and effort and accomplish nothing.”\n\nA correction was made on\n\nMarch 13, 2025\n\n:\n\nAn earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the views of the Climate Enterprise Institute. The group believes global warming has been minimal and good for humanity and the biosphere; it does not promote “climate denial.”\n\nWhen we learn of a mistake, we acknowledge it with a correction. If you spot an error, please let us know at nytnews@nytimes.com.Learn more\n\nMr. Ezell had been ordered to appear before a San Francisco judge as part of a lawsuit brought against the Office of Personnel Management by unions representing some of the fired workers.\n\nAs the office’s acting chief, Mr. Ezell began issuing guidance in January that agencies interpreted as orders to fire federal employees, particularly those with probationary status. That guidance is at the heart of multiple legal challenges, with the once-obscure agency assuming a lead role in President Trump’s government-gutting initiative.\n\nAccording to a legal complaint from the employee unions, Mr. Ezell held a meeting on Feb. 13 with the heads of many federal agencies in which he ordered them to fire tens of thousands of employees. The next day, O.P.M. provided a template to agencies to use for the termination letters, stating that employees were being fired for performance reasons, according to the plaintiffs.\n\nThe unions argued that O.P.M. does not have the authority to make such personnel decisions and asked the court to rule that the office’s orders were illegal and force the government to stop firing people at their direction.\n\nMr. Ezell filed a declaration on Feb. 26 asserting that he did not order the agencies to fire anyone, and that the memos from his office were intended only as “guidance.” The same day, lawyers for the unions filed examples of correspondence from O.P.M. that they argue show that the memos were indeed orders.\n\nA day later, the judge presiding over the case, William Alsup of the Northern District of California, heard arguments from both sides about O.P.M.’s role in the mass firings at the agencies involved in the lawsuit, including the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management and the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nJudge Alsup concluded that O.P.M. has no legal authority to order the agencies to fire anyone, ordered that the government retract the memos and said the government should put a stop to unlawful personnel moves. He also scheduled a hearing for Thursday, March 13, making clear he wanted Mr. Ezell to appear.\n\nO.P.M. responded to his order by retracting the original memos, but the government disputed the need for Mr. Ezell’s testimony. Judge Alsup disagreed, ordering on Monday that Mr. Ezell come before the court.\n\n“The problem here is that Acting Director Ezell submitted a sworn declaration in support of defendants’ position, but now refuses to appear to be cross-examined, or to be deposed,” Judge Alsup wrote Monday.\n\nOn Tuesday, the government confirmed that Mr. Ezell would not comply. Government lawyers said his testimony is not necessary “because existing documentary evidence and briefing demonstrates that O.P.M. is not directing agencies to terminate probationary employees.”\n\nSince the lawsuit was filed, the unions have drastically expanded its scope, including fired employees from 28 agencies, up from the five in the initial complaint.\n\nThe broader scope reflects the extraordinary personnel actions that have been taken since Mr. Trump’s return to office and the opacity surrounding who is responsible for orchestrating the wholesale changes that have been ordered by O.P.M. — Mr. Trump or his government downsizing guru, the tech billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nDuring his address to a joint session of Congress on March 4, Mr. Trump said Mr. Musk is the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, which is overseeing the culling of the federal government. Two days later, Mr. Trump told members of his cabinet that they are the ones in charge of reducing the number of employees at their agencies, not Mr. Musk.\n\nYet members of Mr. Musk’s team continue to show up at federal agencies demanding data and documents and operating with outsized importance.\n\nMr. Ezell’s testimony on Thursday would have given lawyers representing the unions the opportunity to press him on O.P.M.’s role in how Mr. Trump’s government overhaul is being carried out. According to a court filing after the government’s notice informing the judge that Mr. Ezell would not testify, the court clerk said Thursday’s hearing would go on as planned.\n\nMr. Ezell took over as leader of O.P.M. on Inauguration Day. Before that, he was a lower-level official at the agency, overseeing data analytics. He also previously served as a consultant to the agency, according to his LinkedIn page.\n\nZach Montague and Devlin Barrett contributed reporting.\n\nIt remains unclear if the department plans to farm out cases to U.S. attorney’s offices around the country, as has been discussed internally; use the shift to drastically cut the number of investigations; or both.\n\nThe move, like the forced transfers or firings of career nonpolitical prosecutors in recent weeks, is part of an effort to reduce the power of divisions that Trump appointees claim were politically “weaponized” or otherwise overused under the Biden administration.\n\nChad Gilmartin, a department spokesman, would not comment on specific plans but said the department’s leadership was “making sure our resources are being utilized in a way that assures the mission to make America safe again is successful.”\n\nThe changes being considered would affect prosecutors inside the Justice Department’s public integrity division, along with units that prosecute foreign corruption cases and conduct investigations focused on money laundering and asset recovery, the people said.\n\nThe public integrity unit, which focuses on criminal cases against elected officials, has already been particularly hard hit. Several of its prosecutors resigned last month after top officials pushed to drop a bribery case against New York’s mayor, Eric Adams.\n\nOne of the few anti-fraud units inside the department’s main office likely to be spared from the changes is a division that focuses on health care cases.\n\nThis week, senior Justice Department officials consulted with members of the public integrity team and urged them to find positions in other parts of the department, according to a person with knowledge of the exchange. The unit was once run by Jack Smith, the former special counsel who investigated Donald J. Trump.\n\nDepartment officials signaled that the corruption and fraud units inside headquarters, known as Main Justice, could be reduced from an original complement of two dozen to three dozen prosecutors to as few as 10 each, the people familiar with the changes said.\n\nJust as important, the units could be stripped of their ability to file indictments on their own, diminishing them more or less to an advisory role with no real law enforcement powers, they added.\n\nOfficials have long discussed moving fraud and corruption cases from Washington to some of the Justice Department’s 93 U.S. attorney’s offices. That is in keeping with the administration’s overarching belief that federal law enforcement embedded in the states is better suited to investigate corruption and fraud in its own jurisdiction, one of those familiar with the planning effort said.\n\nThe move comes at a time of intense turmoil inside the department, which has experienced a flurry of firings, demotions and personnel changes in the past two months. And the restructuring of the units was only the latest effort by the administration to alter the way that fraud and corruption cases are handled.\n\nLast month, Mr. Trump signed an executive order halting all investigations and prosecutions of corporate corruption in foreign countries under a law known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. He argued that pursuing such cases hurt the United States’ competitive edge.\n\nAdministration officials have also ordered the shutdown of a Justice Department initiative to seize assets owned by foreign kleptocrats.\n\nThat action came after he revoked security clearances held by any lawyers at the firm Covington & Burling who were helping provide legal advice to Jack Smith, the special counsel who brought two federal indictments against Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Trump’s actions, and open threats of more to come, have shaken law firms across Washington and beyond, leaving them looking at their client lists and wondering whether their representation could put them in the president’s cross hairs and endanger their business. Perkins Coie has acknowledged that in just the few days since Mr. Trump signed the executive order it “has already lost significant revenue” because of clients who have severed their relationship with the firm.\n\n“This is certainly the biggest affront to the legal profession in my lifetime,” said Samuel W. Buell, who is a longtime professor of law at Duke University and a former federal prosecutor.\n\nA federal judge on Wednesday sided with Perkins Coie in an initial courtroom skirmish with the White House, temporarily barring a major portion of Mr. Trump’s executive order against the firm from taking effect.\n\n“I am sure that many in the profession are watching in horror at what Perkins Coie is going through,” said Judge Beryl A. Howell of the Federal District Court in Washington. She added, “It sends little chills down my spine” to hear arguments that a president can punish individuals and companies like this.\n\nHer reaction mirrored those of other legal experts who said the issues at stake go far beyond whether or not Mr. Trump will make life difficult for elite law firms and well-paid lawyers.\n\nThe experts say Mr. Trump’s actions could create a trickle-down effect in which those who find themselves under scrutiny from Mr. Trump and his administration struggle to find lawyers who are willing to defend them in the face of the vast powers of the federal government. Those facing scrutiny could be forced to turn to less skilled lawyers or firms that enjoy access or good ties to the White House, the experts say.\n\n“If you’re a political enemy, you really need the best representation when the government comes after you for who you are,” said Daniel C. Richman, a professor of law at Columbia University and former federal prosecutor. “Chilling the lawyers who represent those people hurts the rule of law because when the government can’t be legally opposed, the law provides no protections to anyone and you start to live in an autocracy.”\n\nMr. Trump’s attack on Big Law comes as his administration has also gone after law schools, the American Bar Association and even lawyers inside the government itself who might question or hinder his agenda.\n\nLast week, the top federal prosecutor in Washington threatened to stop hiring graduates from Georgetown Law School if its dean, William Treanor, failed to abolish the school’s diversity programs. Mr. Treanor all but dared the prosecutor, Ed Martin, to make good on his threats, saying that the First Amendment would forbid them.\n\nMr. Trump has often relied on pliant lawyers to do his bidding, and last month he fired the three top lawyers in the armed forces who are supposed to advise military leaders on the legality of various policies and operations. The lawyers, known as judge advocates general, were fired without reference to their professional performance, raising concerns that the administration wanted replacements who would be more amenable to Mr. Trump’s orders.\n\nOne of the first big tests of this new era arose late last week, setting off maneuvering that shows how big firms in Washington are rushing to adapt to the new challenges they face, according to interviews with people involved in or briefed on those discussions.\n\nIn his executive order targeting Perkins Coie, Mr. Trump was going after a firm that represented Mrs. Clinton’s campaign and repeatedly won election law cases in 2020 against Mr. Trump’s campaign. Mr. Trump singled out Perkins Coie’s involvement in a dossier complied during the 2016 campaign by a former British spy about Mr. Trump’s potential ties to Russia.\n\nAmid concerns in the legal community about a chilling effect, few, if any, major firms issued statements condemning Mr. Trump’s action. And amid that silence there was a question about whether any firm would take the even bigger step of agreeing to represent Perkins Coie in its effort to challenge Mr. Trump’s executive order in court.\n\nPerkins Coie reached out to Derek L. Shaffer, a lawyer at the firm Quinn Emanuel. Mr. Shaffer had a long history of bringing civil actions against federal and state governments, and had argued before the Supreme Court three times. Perkins Coie wanted to see if he could take on the firm as a client and quickly go to court to file a suit against the Trump administration to stop the executive order.\n\nConvincing Mr. Shaffer to take the case would come with a major potential bonus: close links to Mr. Trump and his allies.\n\nLawyers at Quinn Emanuel represent Elon Musk and provide ethics advice to the Trump Organization. The firm has also represented Mayor Eric Adams of New York as the Trump Justice Department has moved swiftly to drop corruption charges against Mr. Adams, a Democrat.\n\nBut Perkins Coie was rebuffed. Quinn Emanuel decided against taking the case. Its top leaders concluded that this was not an issue they wanted to jump into at this stage as they continue to build themselves into a power center in Mr. Trump’s Washington.\n\nOther major law firms expressed concerns that if they represented Perkins Coie, they, too, could face Mr. Trump’s ire. Leaders of top firms asked: How would their own clients react if Mr. Trump cut off their access to the government?\n\nIn response, the elite Washington firm Williams and Connolly decided it would take on Perkins Coie as a client.\n\nIt’s unclear why Williams and Connolly was willing to take a risk that other firms were not. But lawyers at Williams and Connolly have long taken pride in their role as an adversary and check against the government, including by highlighting the firm’s role in protecting high-profile defendants against prosecutorial misconduct. The firm was founded by the well-known defense lawyer Edward Bennett Williams, who built his career on vigorously representing an array of clients before the government, including those out of political favor.\n\nOn Tuesday, Williams and Connolly, on behalf of Perkins Coie, filed suit against the Trump administration in Washington. That suit led to Judge Howell’s ruling on Wednesday imposing a temporary restraining order to block for now the section of Mr. Trump’s executive order that essentially barred Perkins Coie from dealing with federal officials and prevented it from entering government buildings. She said the executive order was most likely unconstitutional.\n\nOther law firms have been discussing whether to file a joint amicus brief on behalf of Perkins Coie. While some major firms have signaled they are willing to sign onto it, others have said they are reluctant. On Wednesday, 21 state attorneys general filed their own amicus brief supporting Perkins Coie.\n\nCovington & Burling, which had the security clearance stripped from a lawyer at the firm who was assisting Mr. Smith, has taken a different approach from that of Perkins Coie.\n\nCovington has declined to fight Mr. Trump in court. Instead, the firm, concerned about a perception among its clients that it was falling out of favor with Mr. Trump, has begun discussions with other prominent law firms with fewer ties to Mr. Trump’s perceived enemies about becoming the face of some of their most important cases before the Justice Department.\n\nBut beyond what Mr. Trump has done to law firms, the political appointees he has placed at departments, agencies and commissions are taking on the legal profession in other ways.\n\nOne of Mr. Trump’s political appointees has ordered government officials under him to not renew their memberships to the American Bar Association, hold a position with the association or attend its events.\n\nAt the Justice Department, the attorney general has sent a letter to the American Bar Association questioning its diversity practices.\n\nAnd last week, at an annual conference on white-collar crime for the association, a slew of top officials from the Justice Department — who regularly attend the event — canceled at the last minute. That meant that a conference designed to bring together the industry about an important topic was devoid of senior department officials in charge of enforcing the law.\n\nAbbie VanSickle and Alan Feuer contributed reporting.\n\nA correction was made on\n\nMarch 12, 2025\n\n:\n\nAn earlier version of this story referred imprecisely to an element of the executive order President Trump issued about the law firm Covington & Burling. The order stripped security clearances from any lawyers at the firm who assisted the former special counsel Jack Smith. It did not strip security clearances from the firm.\n\nWhen we learn of a mistake, we acknowledge it with a correction. If you spot an error, please let us know at nytnews@nytimes.com.Learn more\n\nBut news of the proposed appointment generated blowback on the right. A senior administration official said Ms. Gabbard reconsidered her choice given the criticism, and other officials confirmed the decision.\n\nMr. Davis is a senior fellow at Defense Priorities, a think tank with funding from Charles Koch that has a number of alumni in key positions in the Trump administration. Defense Priorities has taken a skeptical view of U.S. military involvement in the Middle East and has supported Mr. Trump’s efforts to reach an immediate cease-fire in the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe abandoned appointment has highlighted an emerging foreign policy fault line in the new administration. The Trump administration has appointed both more hawkish Republicans, like Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Michael Waltz, the national security adviser, and officials far more skeptical of American intervention, including Ms. Gabbard.\n\nThe tug of war over Mr. Davis’s appointment also highlighted the strain among supporters of Mr. Trump’s over U.S. support of Israel.\n\nBefore Mr. Davis’s appointment was pulled, the Anti-Defamation League said on Wednesday that the appointment would be “extremely dangerous.” In a social media post, the group accused Mr. Davis of minimizing Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack and undermining American support for Israel.\n\nConsideration of Mr. Davis had also upset some hawkish conservatives in Congress who began quietly trying to get the administration to rethink it. These officials believed Mr. Davis’s skepticism of the war in Gaza could weaken the Trump administration’s support for Israel.\n\nFormer intelligence officials were also critical of the pick. Marc Polymeropoulos, a former C.I.A. operations officer and a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said Mr. Davis’s positions were outside the ideological mainstream of the Republican Party.\n\n“His overt criticism of Israel and total opposition to any military action against Iran seems to run counter to current administration policy,” Mr. Polymeropoulos said.\n\nAllies of Mr. Davis had defended him and said there was no hint of antisemitism or opposition to Israel in his work. He is skeptical of military action when it does not directly align with American interests, they say, and troubled by the use of proxies when the United States is unwilling to put its own troops in harm’s way.\n\nWhile some of Mr. Davis’s criticisms of Israel are well outside the mainstream of the Republican Party, they are similar to certain critiques by liberal Democrats. He has spoken frequently about the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump has repeatedly called for Palestinians to be removed from Gaza to allow it to be redeveloped into a beach resort, Mr. Davis has said the removal of people from the territory would be “ethnic cleansing.”\n\nIn January, he wrote on social media that U.S. support for Israel’s war in Gaza was a “stain on our character as a nation, as a culture, that will not soon go away.”\n\nConsideration of Mr. Davis for the intelligence post was reported earlier by Jewish Insider.\n\nMs. Gabbard has said little about the war in Gaza recently. But many of Mr. Davis’s other positions, including a skepticism of American support for Ukraine’s war effort and his worries about the consequences of the fall of the Syrian government, match her views. And Mr. Davis’s social media feed has been supportive of Ms. Gabbard’s foreign policy positions.\n\nDuring the Biden administration, the head of mission integration conducted many intelligence briefings at the White House. Beth Sanner, who was deputy director of mission integration through much of the first Trump administration, was the primary presidential briefer. Another intelligence official has had that responsibility in the current Trump administration, according to former officials.\n\nIn recent years, senior C.I.A. analysts with decades of experience have had the briefing responsibility. Robert Cardillo, who was the first person ever to hold the job, had been a senior official at the Defense Intelligence Agency.\n\nThe grants were issued to a total of eight nonprofit organizations through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which received $27 billion in funding from Congress through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nBut since taking office, Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A.’s administrator, has tried to claw back the money, saying they were part of a “scheme” and citing as evidence a hidden-camera video from Project Veritas, a conservative group known for using covert recordings to embarrass its political opponents.\n\nThe E.P.A. can cancel the grant contracts if it can document examples of waste, fraud, and abuse by the grantees. But that hasn’t happened at this point.\n\nYesterday, Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee launched an investigation into the E.P.A,’s freezing of the funds and what they said were Mr. Zeldin’s “false and misleading statements.”\n\nTwo of the nonprofit grant recipients, Climate United and the Coalition for Green Capital, said they will fight the cancellation. A court hearing on a related case is scheduled for Wednesday.\n\nHere is what we know about the $20 billion in funding and how it became a target of the E.P.A.\n\nHow the controversy started\n\nIn February, Mr. Zeldin announced that he had found billions of dollars of “gold bars” of grant funding at Citibank, calling the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (or “green bank”) grant program a “scheme” and a “rush job with no oversight.”\n\nMr. Zeldin has embraced the Trump administration’s emphasis on spending cuts, touting his work with the Department of Government Efficiency. He has canceled scores of other E.P.A. contracts, totaling what the agency said is around $2 billion across more than 400 initiatives.\n\nThe “gold bars” comment was a reference to a video released in December by Project Veritas in which Brent Efron, then an E.P.A. employee, likened his agency’s efforts to spend federal funds on climate programs before leaving office to throwing “gold bars” off the Titanic.\n\nMr. Efron’s lawyer has denied his client was referring to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.\n\nAfter Mr. Zeldin’s statement, Ed Martin, the interim U.S. attorney for Washington D.C., asked Denise Cheung, a top federal prosecutor, to freeze the $20 billion held by Citibank. But she abruptly resigned after determining there was not enough evidence to order the funds frozen. The F.B.I. and the Justice Department continued their investigations.\n\nLast week, Mr. Zeldin also referred the matter to his agency’s acting inspector general for a third, concurrent investigation.\n\nThe nonprofit grant recipients began executing their legal defense this past weekend, when Climate United sued E.P.A. and Citibank, claiming they were illegally withholding the money. Two other recipients filed suits against Citibank in the following days.\n\nA hearing on Climate United’s request for a temporary restraining order to release the funds was scheduled for Wednesday in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.\n\nWhat the nonprofits are saying\n\nThe cancellations surprised Climate United, a nonprofit organization that was awarded nearly $7 billion, said Beth Bafford, the group’s chief executive officer. She said she received an official termination letter a half-hour before the agency issued a public statement.\n\nThe nonprofits have been unable to access the funds in their Citibank accounts since mid-February. The funds have been held there under an agreement between the E.P.A. and the bank.\n\nWithout the promised funds, some groups said they are struggling to pay staff.\n\nIn a termination letter viewed by The New York Times, the E.P.A. said it had identified “material deficiencies” in the program, including the absence of adequate oversight and improper or speculative allocation of funds. It did not provide any evidence.\n\nThe Coalition for Green Capital, one of the largest recipients, called the E.P.A.’s decision “unauthorized and unlawful,” and said it was considering legal options.\n\nWhat we know about the $20 billion program\n\nThe $20 billion program was designed to offer low-cost loans to businesses and developers for climate initiatives, which include things like installing solar panels and retrofitting homes to make them more energy efficient.\n\nThe E.P.A. distributed the money to eight nonprofits, which planned to distribute the money as loans as well as grants to local “green banks’” or credit unions, which would in turn make their own loans.\n\nThe idea was that the commitment of federal dollars would attract private investments to green projects.\n\nMr. Zeldin has made much of the fact that $20 billion in grant money was held at Citibank, portraying the E.P.A.’s decision to use an outside financial institution as an intermediary as an attempt to subvert oversight.\n\nGrant recipients and former E.P.A. officials have disputed this characterization, and said that the agency has full visibility into transactions through the Citibank accounts for the nonprofit organizations and their sub-recipients\n\nIt’s not clear how much of the $20 billion was spent before the freeze was put in place.\n\nA spokeswoman for the E.P.A. said it could not answer how much of the money has been loaned out by the nonprofits because the funds were spent under the Biden administration.\n\nCitibank did not respond to request for comment.",

        "full_text": "The Department of Education plans to cut about half its staff, officials announced Tuesday evening.\n\nSenior officials within the department told reporters on Tuesday that the reduction will not have any impact on the government's ability to deliver programming to students but is instead about \"consolidation\" of redundant roles.\n\nThe department will make the following reductions from its more than 4,000 staff:\n\n259 staffers who signed up for deferred resignation\n\n313 staffers who accepted $25,000 voluntary separation incentive payments\n\n1,315 staffers who are now subject to the reduction in force\n\n63 probationary employees who had their roles eliminated in February\n\nThose staffers who are now subject to the reduction in force will receive full pay and benefits for the next 90 days and a severance of one week's salary for service up to 10 years and 2 weeks' salary for every additional year of service.\n\nNotifications to affected workers were sent via email around 6 p.m. ET on Tuesday, department officials said. The main Department of Education office building was to be closed for safety on Wednesday.\n\nThe reductions would also lead to a consolidation in department office space, officials said. Offices in San Francisco, California; New York; Boston, Massachusetts; Chicago, Illinois; Cleveland, Ohio; and Dallas, Texas would be closed. The department would also consolidate its footprint in Washington, D.C., from three buildings to one.\n\nThe cuts would not impact federal student aid, FAFSA operations, civil rights investigations or any other mandatory department functions, officials said.\n\nRELATED STORY | Senate confirms billionaire Linda McMahon as Secretary of Education\n\nThe reduction comes shortly after the Senate confirmed billionaire Linda McMahon, President Trump's pick for Education Secretary.\n\nAt her confirmation hearing, McMahon said she intended to make the Education Department \"operate more efficiently.\"\n\nBut President Trump has promised to eliminate the Department of Education. He has already signed sweeping orders to target diversity programs and transgender accommodations in schools and expand school choice.\n\nCritics warn staffing cuts at the department will erode its effectiveness in the meantime.\n\n“The real victims will be our most vulnerable students. Gutting the Department of Education will send class sizes soaring, cut job training programs, make higher education more expensive and out of reach for middle-class families, take away special education services for students with disabilities, and gut student civil rights protections,\" said National Education Association President Becky Pringle. “Firing — without cause — nearly half of the Department of Education staff means they are getting rid of the dedicated public servants who help ensure our nation’s students have access to the programs and resources to keep class sizes down and expand learning opportunities for students so they can grow into their full brilliance. The Trump administration has abandoned students, parents, and educators across the nation.\"",

        "full_text": "I walked into the Washington Post building for the first time in the summer of 1981. Past the red linotype machine that marked the entrance to the Post’s Fifteenth Street headquarters for so many years and up to the fifth-floor newsroom, a cavernous space that looked just as it’s depicted in “All the President’s Men.”\n\nI was fresh out of college and on my way to law school. Along the way, I’d worked at a small legal newspaper, where I found myself both interested in the subject and annoyed at being condescended to by lawyers about my lack of a degree. Bob Woodward, the Post’s Metro editor, had read some of my pieces and invited me in to talk. In fact, he tried to talk me out of law school. He told me that he had turned down Harvard to work for the Sentinel, a paper in Montgomery County, Maryland. Why not just come to the Post?\n\nI gulped, and asked Woodward how old he had been then. Twenty-seven, he said. Great, I said, I’ll be twenty-six when I graduate from law school. I’ll be back. And I was, first as a summer intern, in 1982, and then as a full-time reporter, starting September 4, 1984, covering Prince George’s County, in suburban Maryland. I stayed for forty years, six months, and six days.\n\nI stayed until I no longer could—until the newspaper’s owner, Jeff Bezos, issued an edict that the Post’s opinion offerings would henceforth concentrate on the twin pillars of “personal liberties and free markets,” and, even more worrisome, that “viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.” I stayed until the Post’s publisher, Will Lewis, killed a column I filed last week expressing my disagreement with this new direction. Lewis refused my request to meet. (You can read the column in full below, but—spoiler alert—if you’re craving red meat, brace for tofu. I wrote the piece in the hope of getting it published and registering a point, not to embarrass or provoke the paper’s management.)\n\nIs it possible to love an institution the way you love a person, fiercely and without reservation? For me, and for many other longtime staff reporters and editors, that is the way we have felt about the Post. It was there for us, and we for it. One Saturday night, in May, 1992, the investigative reporter George Lardner, Jr., was in the newsroom when he received a call that his twenty-one-year-old daughter, Kristin, had been shot and killed in Boston by an abusive ex-boyfriend. As I recall, there were no more flights that night to Boston. The Post’s C.E.O., Don Graham, chartered a plane to get Lardner where he needed to go. It was typical of Graham, a kindness that engendered the loyalty and affection of a dedicated staff.\n\nGraham’s own supreme act of loyalty to the Post was his painful decision to sell the paper, in 2013, to Bezos, who made his vast fortune as the founder of Amazon. The Graham family was hardly poor, but in the new media environment—and under the relentless demands of reporting quarterly earnings—they were forced, again and again, to make trims, at a time when investment was needed. Instead of continuing to cut and, inevitably, diminish the paper that he loved, Graham carried out a meticulous search for a new owner with the resources, the judgment, and the vision to help the Post navigate this new era. Bezos—the “ultimate disrupter,” as Fortune had called him a year earlier—seemed the right choice.\n\nAs a deputy to the late editorial-page editor Fred Hiatt, I had the chance to see the drama of a new ownership play out up close. In the summer and fall of 2016, as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump battled for the Presidency, our editorial board, of which I was a member, was unsparing in its criticism of Trump. As the G.O.P. Convention concluded, in late July, Hiatt published an extra-long editorial that made it clear, even before Democrats held their Convention, that the paper could not support Trump.\n\n“The real estate tycoon is uniquely unqualified to serve as president, in experience and temperament,” Hiatt wrote. “He is mounting a campaign of snarl and sneer, not substance. To the extent he has views, they are wrong in their diagnosis of America’s problems and dangerous in their proposed solutions. Mr. Trump’s politics of denigration and division could strain the bonds that have held a diverse nation together. His contempt for constitutional norms might reveal the nation’s two-century-old experiment in checks and balances to be more fragile than we knew.” That wasn’t the end of what we had to say. In September, 2016, we published a series of six editorials outlining “the clear and present danger of Donald Trump,” from climate change to the global economy to immigration.\n\nWe had every indication that Bezos shared this sense of alarm. Bezos and Hiatt held twice-monthly telephone calls, which I joined, along with the Post’s then publisher, Fred Ryan, and Hiatt’s other deputy, Jackson Diehl. These were not conversations in which the owner handed down instructions; they were more like dorm-room gab sessions, with a heavy dose of policy. We proffered morsels of Washington gossip and delivered our insights, such as they were, about politics and international affairs. Bezos talked about the need to find innovative ways to connect with readers—he mentioned something about an exploding watermelon that had gone viral on BuzzFeed, though I didn’t exactly follow how that applied to our work. When our humor columnist Alexandra Petri spoofed Samuel Beckett in “Waiting for Pivot: A GOP Tragicomedy,” featuring Vladimir Ryan and Estragon Priebus waiting for Trump’s shift to the center, Bezos suggested that we post a video dramatization. (Proving that immense wealth and sole ownership don’t always get you what you want, our video department balked.)\n\nIn my experience of that time, Bezos came off as charming, smart, and unpretentious. “Guys, this is always the most interesting meeting of my week,” he would often say, seeming to mean it. Or, “I know we’ve been going on for a while, but can I hold you for one more question?”—as if he weren’t the owner, and we weren’t at his beck and call.\n\nTrump’s first election and Inauguration brought some inklings of trouble. Some sixty-three million voters had backed Trump, but even our conservative columnists—including George Will, Charles Krauthammer, and Michael Gerson—were highly critical of Trump. Bezos pressed us to find more writers from the heartland, who might understand Trump’s appeal. This was entirely appropriate. More unsettling was his expressed desire, at the start of the new Administration, to have the editorial page find something, anything, positive to say about Trump. During Trump’s first term, the Post’s executive editor was Martin Baron. As Baron relates in his book, “Collision of Power,” Bezos “urged showing support for Trump on whatever issues he could. . . . Whenever the Post editorial board’s view coincided with Trump’s, why not say so?” Hiatt, Baron wrote, “feared that Bezos was anxious to smooth things over with the new occupant of the White House.” During one pre-Inauguration phone call, Bezos seized on a line from Trump’s first post-election news conference—“I have great respect for the news and great respect for freedom of the press and all of that”—as a promising sign. This was an exceedingly charitable interpretation, given that, at the same event, Trump had refused to take a question from “fake news” CNN, called the BBC “another beauty,” and denounced BuzzFeed as a “failing pile of garbage,” and we suggested as much to Bezos.\n\nStill, we tried to give Trump, where possible, the benefit of the doubt. One example was an editorial published on January 18, 2017, outlining “five policies Trump might get right.” It noted that, despite the newspaper’s endorsement of his opponent, Trump’s “election was legitimate, and his inauguration is inevitable. All of us have a duty to oppose Mr. Trump when he is wrong, but also to remain open to supporting him when he and the Republican-majority Congress make worthy proposals.” In the end, we didn’t find much to cheer about in Trump’s first term—and Bezos never pressured us to go easy on him.\n\nFour years later, the editorial board endorsed Joe Biden for President, warning that “democracy is at risk, at home and around the world. The nation desperately needs a president who will respect its public servants; stand up for the rule of law; acknowledge Congress’s constitutional role; and work for the public good, not his private benefit.” There was no disagreement from the owner.\n\nSo much changed—and long before Bezos’s eleventh-hour decision to kill the newspaper’s endorsement of Kamala Harris in 2024. Hiatt died suddenly in December, 2021. He was replaced by David Shipley (full disclosure: I applied for the job and didn’t get it), who, as an executive editor of Bloomberg’s opinion coverage, had experience dealing with, and channelling the views of, a billionaire owner. To read the paper’s 2024 editorials on Trump and Biden, and then on Trump and Harris, is to experience a once passionate voice grown hesitant and muted. (I left the editorial board in September, 2023.) Granted, Democrats offered voters two far from perfect candidates, but, to paraphrase Biden, we’re not comparing them to the Almighty here.\n\nCertainly, Trump was not spared from criticism; in fact, there was no doubt which candidate the editorial board preferred. Yet the shift in tone was unmistakable. You would not know from the 2024 editorials that just four years earlier we had called Trump “the worst president of modern times”—and that was before the January 6th insurrection at the Capitol. A September, 2024, editorial that purported to compare Trump and Harris on policy grounds concluded that “the substantive contrasts Ms. Harris draws with Mr. Trump generally make her look better. But should Americans settle?” Generally? Look at what Trump’s been doing since taking office—at his barrage of unconstitutional, small-minded, and cruel executive orders—and tell me that Harris was “generally” better.\n\nIt was becoming clear, as September gave way to October, that something was up with the endorsement. Those not in the know—which included almost all of us in the Opinions section, because the piece was unusually closely held—figured that the delay involved negotiating over tone and adjectives. Then, on October 25th, came the first of our self-inflicted wounds: the paper’s leadership announced that, in fact, we would not be issuing an endorsement in the 2024 Presidential race, and wouldn’t in future contests.\n\nLewis, the publisher and chief executive officer, cast this decision as “returning to our roots,” referring to our long-ago practice of not endorsing in Presidential contests. This was, to say the least, unconvincing. The modern Post—the post-Watergate Post—issued Presidential endorsements in every election but the dreary Michael Dukakis–George H. W. Bush matchup, of 1988, when the paper rigorously explained its reasoning for finding neither of the candidates worthy.\n\nThe more senior columnists—David Ignatius, Eugene Robinson, Karen Tumulty, Dana Milbank, and I—conferred about what to do. We drafted a statement, eventually signed by twenty-one columnists, calling the decision “a terrible mistake” and an “abandonment of the fundamental editorial convictions of the newspaper that we love.” I called my editor to say that I’d also be filing a column disagreeing with this decision. What I heard back was encouraging: the section editors welcome it, they’ll run it, they’ll hold space for you in print. And the column ran, with no resistance from editors.\n\n“I have never been more disappointed in the newspaper than I am today,” I wrote. The owner has the right to shape editorial policy, I acknowledged, and there are reasons to eschew endorsements: they can cause headaches for the separate, news side of the paper. Moreover, Presidential endorsements are something of a vanity operation—unlike with more local contests, readers don’t need them to guide their votes. Choosing to abandon the practice would be a reasonable decision.\n\nStill, I argued, “this is not the time to make such a shift. It is the time to speak out, as loudly and convincingly as possible, to make the case that we made in 2016 and again in 2020.” Since then, Trump had incited an insurrection that threatened the life of his own Vice-President, had refused to accept the reality of his 2020 loss and claimed he wouldn’t accept defeat in the 2024 contest, and had threatened to “go after” political enemies and “terminate” the Constitution. “What self-respecting news organization could abandon its entrenched practice of making presidential endorsements in the face of all this?” I asked.\n\nThe “kicker” wrote itself, and it is painful to read now: “Many friends and readers have reached out today, saying they planned to cancel their subscriptions or had already done so. I understand, and share, your anger. I think the best answer, for you and for me, may be embodied in this column: You are reading it, on the same platform, in the same newspaper, that has so gravely disappointed you.”\n\nAs many as three hundred thousand readers reportedly cancelled their subscriptions. Two of our non-staff columnists—Robert Kagan and Michele Norris—resigned. Should I have joined them? The paper had demonstrated that my columnist colleagues and I were free to write what we wanted. If Trump were elected, I reasoned, my voice and my expertise—we columnists are a grandiose lot—would count for something. In retrospect, you can say that this frog chose to remain in the simmering pot, but she thought hard about it.\n\nThings got worse, in two connected ways—three if you count Trump’s election. After November 5th, Bezos joined his fellow tech billionaires in seeming to court Trump’s favor. “I’m actually very optimistic this time around,” Bezos said on December 4th, at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit. “He seems to have a lot of energy around reducing regulation. And my point of view, if I can help him do that, I’m going to help him.”\n\nWhen his interviewer, Andrew Ross Sorkin, pressed Bezos about Trump’s depiction of the press as “the enemy,” Bezos said, “I’m gonna try to talk him out of that idea. I don’t think the press is the enemy and I don’t think, he’s also—you’ve probably grown in the last eight years. He has, too.” Trump, he continued, “is calmer than he was the first time and more confident, more settled.” This wasn’t the triumph of hope over experience; it was the elevation of willful self-delusion over all available evidence.\n\nOn December 12th, Amazon said that it would follow Meta’s lead and donate a million dollars to Trump’s Inauguration. On December 18th, Bezos and his fiancée, Lauren Sánchez, dined with Trump and Melania at Mar-a-Lago, joined by Elon Musk. “In this term, everybody wants to be my friend,” Trump observed. He had reason to think as much. On January 5th, Amazon announced that it had bought the rights to a documentary about Melania, co-produced by Melania herself. Puck’s Matthew Belloni reported that the streaming service was paying forty million dollars to license the film—reportedly the most Amazon had ever spent on a documentary, and almost three times the highest competing bid. The Wall Street Journal reported that Melania stood to pocket more than seventy per cent of that fee—and that, at the Mar-a-Lago dinner, Melania “regaled” Bezos and Sánchez with details about the project.\n\nAmid all this, Ann Telnaes, the Post’s Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist, submitted a cartoon depicting Bezos and his fellow-billionaires on their knees before a statue of Trump. On January 3rd, Telnaes announced that she was quitting because the cartoon had been rejected. “There have been instances where sketches have been rejected or revisions requested, but never because of the point of view inherent in the cartoon’s commentary,” Telnaes wrote. “That’s a game changer . . . and dangerous for a free press.” As far as I can tell, the rejection didn’t happen at Bezos’s direction. Shipley, the editorial-page editor, made the call, on the unconvincing ground that the cartoon was duplicative—Eugene Robinson had written a column on the billionaires’ pilgrimages to Mar-a-Lago, and another one was in the works.\n\n“Not every editorial judgment is a reflection of a malign force,” Shipley wrote in a statement. The “only bias” in the decision, he added, “was against repetition.” It is true that the section under Shipley’s guidance had tried to crack down on multiple columns making the same point. But the notion that a cartoon could not make a similar point was ludicrous. (In any event, there had been developments since Robinson’s column: the centerpiece of the Telnaes cartoon was a prostrate Mickey Mouse, reflecting Disney’s malodorous decision to settle Trump’s defamation lawsuit against ABC News by paying fifteen million dollars for his Presidential foundation and museum and a million dollars to cover his legal fees.) There is no doubt in my mind that, absent Bezos, the cartoon would have run unchallenged. The decision to kill it was an instance of obeying in advance.\n\nThis episode was far more concerning than the non-endorsement decision, because it wasn’t limited to the paper’s institutional editorial position—it implied that restrictions were coming for columnists, too. In hindsight—and, again, I thought about it at the time—maybe that should have been the moment I left.\n\nThen came the Inauguration, with the spectacle of Bezos and his fellow-tycoons arrayed like so many trophies behind the triumphant new President. I tested the limits with a column about the “inauguration of the oligarchs.” The column decried the spectacle and named Bezos but, I have to confess, shied away from pointing out that a newspaper was among Bezos’s playthings. His presence on the inaugural platform conveyed a message of support for Trump that, I can say now, was inappropriate.\n\nAs it turned out, the vast majority of us at the paper had no idea what was happening behind the scenes as Shipley, Lewis, and Bezos debated a new vision for the Opinions section. That vision arrived in our inboxes at 9:31 A.M. on February 26th, with Bezos’s announcement of “a change coming to our opinion pages” and the news that Shipley was resigning.\n\n“I offered David Shipley, whom I greatly admire, the opportunity to lead this new chapter. I suggested to him that if the answer wasn’t ‘hell yes,’ then it had to be ‘no,’ ” Bezos wrote. “After careful consideration, David decided to step away.”\n\nThe columnists were deeply wounded by the newly announced limits and what they portended. We had always been able to assure our readers that no one restricted what we could write. How could we credibly make that claim now? What was the meaning of “personal liberties and free markets?” Without further clarification, we were like dogs that had been fitted with shock collars but had no clue where the invisible fence was situated. Dana Milbank was the first to test the new regime, with a clever column that put every Trump action through a Bezosian lens. “If we as a newspaper, and we as a country, are to defend Bezos’s twin pillars, then we must redouble our fight against the single greatest threat to ‘personal liberties and free markets’ in the United States today: President Donald Trump,” he wrote.\n\nMilbank’s column somehow passed muster and ran—even though that required the highly unusual step of it being submitted to the publisher for review. Eugene Robinson followed, with a subtle column on the new documentary about Katharine Graham; the column made no reference to Bezos, but its paeans to Graham’s courage in the face of Richard Nixon’s threats evoked an implicit comparison with the current owner and his relationship with Trump. Our media critic, Erik Wemple, was less fortunate. His straightforward column disagreeing with the Bezos announcement—I read it in our internal system, and found it perfectly reasonable—never ran.\n\nAnd so I took the plunge. On a long flight to Washington, I opened my laptop. I knew what would likely happen before I typed a single word. I had spoken out forcefully against the decision to kill the endorsement. Censoring columnists was way worse. Having written then, how could I stay silent and live with myself now? Still, I hesitated. Since Trump’s Inauguration, I had been writing at a furious pace, assailing his blizzard of executive orders, his assaults on the rule of law, his dismantling of the Justice Department, which I had covered as a young reporter. Was speaking out on Bezos important enough to risk losing the platform that the Post provided?\n\nI tried, as you will see if you read the column, to give the editors a way to get to yes. I made almost no mention of Bezos’s post-election efforts to cozy up to Trump. I did not question Bezos’s motives. The column was, if anything, meek to the point of embarrassing. But I thought that it was important to put my reasons for disagreement on the record—not only to be true to myself but to show that the newspaper could brook criticism and that columnists still enjoyed freedom of expression. Running it, I believed, would enhance the Post’s credibility, not undermine it.\n\nJust before 1 P.M. on Monday, March 3rd, my editor sent the column to higher-ups for review. Under ordinary circumstances, it would have gone to the copy desk in a matter of hours. This time, silence ensued. Early Wednesday evening, some fifty hours after the column was first submitted, I received a call from Mary Duenwald, who had followed Shipley from Bloomberg to serve as a deputy. The verdict from Will Lewis, she said, was no. Pause here for a moment: I know of no other episode at the Washington Post, and I have checked with longtime employees at the paper, when a publisher has ordered a column killed.\n\nAccording to Duenwald’s explanation, the column did not pass the “high bar” required for the Post to write about itself. It was “too speculative,” because we couldn’t know, until a new opinion editor was named, what the impact of the new direction would be. It could turn out that none of our columns would be affected by the Bezos plan. Duenwald said that my column on the endorsement had been accepted because it involved a clear-cut decision; the opinion-page policy was a work in progress.\n\nNone of this was any more convincing than the rationale for rejecting the Telnaes cartoon. At bottom, the “too speculative” excuse took our owner for a feckless fool, which he is most certainly not. He announced a change in direction, and we should take him at his word, not assume that it was meaningless, or that he would forget about the idea. And my point was not only about what columns would get through the filter, once installed; it was about maintaining the trust of our readers. I asked to speak with Lewis. He declined to see me, instructing an editor to inform me that there was no reason to meet, because his decision was final.\n\nSo, too, was mine. I submitted my letter of resignation on Monday, to Bezos and Lewis. “Will’s decision to not run the column that I wrote respectfully dissenting from Jeff’s edict—something that I have not experienced in almost two decades of column-writing—underscores that the traditional freedom of columnists to select the topics they wish to address and say what they think has been dangerously eroded,” I wrote. “I love the Post. It breaks my heart to conclude that I must leave.”\n\nThis was not the outcome I sought. I will always be rooting for the Post and its journalists. I hope, for the sake of my colleagues but even more for the good of readers, that Bezos’s plan for the Opinions section will turn out in practice to be more capacious and less stifling than feared. Even more, I hope that Bezos will hold to his commitment, and to his stalwart practice, during Trump’s first term, of not knuckling under to the President’s pressure campaign to interfere with news coverage. We have lost so much talent in the newsroom in the past few months as reporters and editors have defected to competitors—and we’re still publishing remarkable work. (I’ll never stop saying “we.”)\n\nI wish we could return to the newspaper of a not so distant past. But that is not to be, and here is the unavoidable truth: the Washington Post I joined, the one I came to love, is not the Washington Post I left.\n\nHere is the column that the Post would not run:\n\n“The values of the Post do not need changing,” Jeff Bezos told employees when he bought the newspaper a dozen years ago. He echoed the words of the Post’s owner Eugene Meyer in 1935, emphasizing, “The paper’s duty will remain to its readers and not to the private interests of its owners.”\n\nAgreed, and, at the risk of sounding naïve, I believe Bezos still agrees as well. But I must respectfully dissent—as I did when he decided just before the election to spike our endorsement in the Presidential race—from his newly announced vision for the Opinions section. The section will focus, Bezos said, on “personal liberties and free markets.” More ominously, he added, “viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.”\n\nBezos owns the Post, and this decree is within his prerogatives. An owner who meddles with news coverage, especially to further personal interests, is behaving unethically. Shaping opinion coverage is different, and less problematic. But narrowing the range of acceptable opinions is an unwise course, one that disserves and underestimates our readers.\n\nThis is my forty-first year at the Post. I’ve spent more than half of them now on the opinions side of what we think of as the church-state divide, as a writer of unsigned editorials, a columnist, and, for a six-year stretch during the Bezos years, a deputy editorial-page editor, overseeing the op-ed pages.\n\nDuring that time, we had two fixed stars. First, an editorial page—the unsigned opinions that express the views of the newspaper—that was fiercely devoted to, yes, “personal liberties and free markets,” including the promotion of democracy at home and abroad. Second, an op-ed section—the signed opinion columns and other content—that embraced no orthodoxy. Instead, we consciously and assertively endeavored to present our readers with a range of views.\n\nWhen Trump arrived on the scene, with a perspective endorsed by tens of millions of voters, we broadened our conservative offerings to include that point of view. The theory—a theory that I believe Bezos not only accepted but cheered—was that readers would benefit from this diversity. They didn’t need to be told what to think.\n\nHow does the new focus on “personal liberties and free markets” fit into this? What “viewpoints opposing those pillars” consist of is a mystery. Compliance is in the eye of the beholder, whomever that might turn out to be. We have been assured by our interim managers that decision-making will proceed unchanged as we await a new opinion editor to implement the Bezos vision. But that is merely a postponement of sentence, unless we are to believe that it means no change at all, which does not seem to be Bezos’s intent.\n\nI’m devoted to free markets, but I also believe in the role of government in preserving competition in those markets, and the role of reasonable regulation in the service of protecting consumers, keeping planes in the sky, insuring clean water and safe drugs. Does my viewpoint undermine a Bezosian pillar or uphold it? I don’t know and I’m not sure how any editor overseeing the section is supposed to know. The better approach—the one we’ve always taken—is to have an array of views, helping readers formulate their own. Read George Will and Megan McArdle on regulation, then Catherine Rampell and Eugene Robinson. You decide.\n\nThe matter of personal liberties is similarly contested. Think about abortion rights. I believe fervently that women should have the right to control their own bodies—that this decision is a matter of personal liberty. But others believe with equal conviction that abortion is the taking of a human life. What more fundamental liberty is there than that? I have solicited and edited columns that argue for protecting fetal personhood. Which point of view passes the “personal liberties” test? Aren’t readers better off being exposed to both? You can go through the same exercise on gun rights and numerous other topics. My reasonable regulation is your infringement on the Second Amendment.\n\nAnd speaking of readers: We columnists owe them our best judgments on any particular issue. We ask them to trust that that is what we provide; that we aren’t being told how to think or what to say, or trimming our sails to stay out of dangerous waters. But, once the changes are implemented, I fear that readers will no longer be able to rely on such assurances, because Bezos, as I read his message, has told them they can’t. He won’t publish views that don’t conform to his principles. If that is somehow a misreading of the missive, please tell us. If not, the New York Times columnist David Brooks put it well on “PBS NewsHour” on Friday: “Jeff Bezos, when he says . . . we’re going to have an opinion section in the Washington Post that does not brook dissent, that’s just not journalism.”\n\nIt was one thing when the owner chose to dispense with Presidential endorsements. The editorial page, consisting of unsigned editorials, reflects the views of the owner. Signed opinions express the views of their creator. My job is supposed to be to tell you what I think, not what Jeff Bezos thinks I should think.\n\nAnd now comes the dicey part, because the Bezos missive does not arrive in a vacuum but in the context of the owner’s repeated overtures to Trump. Whatever his internal motivations, it is asking a lot of readers not to suspect that Bezos’s personal business interests play no role here.\n\nBezos has said that the Post is a “complexifier” for him, and he—for all the many good things he has accomplished for the Post—is a complexifier for us. By issuing this statement, in the midst of Trump’s assault on democracy, Bezos inevitably makes that complexity all the more difficult. “We must work harder to control what we can control to increase our credibility,” he wrote last October, after the decision to spike the Kamala Harris endorsement. It is hard to see how this edict helps. ♦",

        "full_text": "The federal government is undergoing a wave of job cuts across multiple agencies in 2025. Spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), these reductions have impacted many public sector employees, from environmental regulators to defense contractors.\n\nThis week, the Trump administration begins rehiring thousands of probationary workers, which incorporates Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of the Treasury, Department of Agriculture, Department of Defense, Department of Energy and Department of the Interior. It comes after Judge William Alsup ordered multiple government agencies to rehire them last week.\n\nThe wave of federal government layoffs in 2025 impacts tens of thousands of public sector workers. The cuts, part of President Donald Trump's broader effort to reduce government spending, have sparked concerns about economic instability, the strain on unemployment systems, and the disruption of essential government services.\n\nThe layoffs have already had significant consequences, affecting federal agencies, contractors, and even military installations. As the reductions continue, political, economic, and legal battles are intensifying over the legality and impact of these cuts.\n\nOver a dozen federal agencies have been impacted by layoffs thus far.\n\nLayoffs announced by U.S. employers jumped 245 percent in February, with federal government job cuts leading the surge, according to Reuters. Government agencies accounted for the bulk of these layoffs, with 62,530 federal workers dismissed in the first two months of 2025. That's a dramatic 41,311 percent increase compared to the same period in 2024.\n\nThe scale of layoffs has already started to overwhelm the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE) program, according to a CNBC analysis. The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, reported that the mass firings could result in significant delays for federal workers trying to access unemployment benefits.\n\nThe Department of Government Efficiency, led by billionaire Elon Musk, was created to oversee broad reductions in federal employment. Musk has defended the cuts as necessary to eliminate \"government bloat\" and improve efficiency.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News last month, Trump suggested that DOGE's cost-cutting measures could be Musk's greatest accomplishment, topping his efforts at Tesla and SpaceX.\n\nTrump's executive order about reshaping the workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency states that the administration will \"empower American families, workers, taxpayers, and our system of Government itself.\"\n\nA survey by polling firm YouGov indicated that support for DOGE has declined week over week. This comes as the Trump administration was ordered to reinstate federal workers that he laid off.\n\nSeveral federal agencies have been significantly affected by the layoffs.\n\nThe federal agencies that have been hit with layoffs include:\n\nIt is not immediately clear exactly how many federal workers have been cut in 2025. However, based on reporting by Newsweek and other media outlets, an estimated 222,000 job cuts have been announced this year, with more expected as federal agencies implement budget reductions.\n\nFederal contractors have also been impacted, and some private sector employers have laid off workers due to funding losses. Additionally, several state governments reliant on federal grants have begun to see secondary job losses.\n\nWhile some agencies have already seen extensive cuts, others are bracing for further reductions. Positions at risk include:\n\nThe Biden-appointed Merit Systems Protection Board has intervened in several cases to temporarily reinstate employees. On March 4, the board ordered the USDA to temporarily reinstate more than 5,000 probationary employees for 45 days while an investigation into the legality of their termination was conducted.\n\nWith lawsuits challenging the legality of some layoffs and Congress considering emergency legislation to provide financial assistance to affected workers, the future of these reductions remains uncertain.\n\nAs agencies scramble to adjust to reduced workforces, the long-term impact on public services and government operations is still unfolding.\n\nCheck back for the latest updates on federal employee cuts.\n\nUpdate 3/11/25 9:05 a.m. ET: This story has been updated with additional information.\n\nUpdate 3/12/25 9:20 a.m. ET: This story has been updated with additional information.\n\nUpdate 3/13/25 4 p.m. ET: This story has been updated with additional information.",

        "full_text": "Consumer prices remained relatively stable in February even as some economists have warned that prices could rise again amid Donald Trump’s trade war and stock markets have fallen on fears of a recession.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics latest Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks the prices of a range of goods and services, the annualized inflation in February was 2.8%, a 0.2% decrease from January’s year-over-year rate of 3%. The month-by-month price increase for all goods minus the volatile food and energy industries was 0.2%, compared with January’s 0.4%.\n\nThe egg shortage caused by the avian flu outbreak drove egg prices up 10.4% in February. Meanwhile, energy prices cooled a bit, rising 0.2% in February compared with 1.1% in January.\n\nWhile inflation has declined sharply from its peak just above 9% in 2022, price increases have remained above the Federal Reserve’s target rate of 2%. The closest inflation has gotten to the target rate was in September, when inflation hit 2.4%.\n\nThe Fed had spent the last few years adjusting interest rates in an attempt to gently lower inflation without hurting the labor market. At the end of last year, it seemed as if the Fed would achieve the so-called “soft landing”: prices were coming down, and the unemployment rate remained relatively low at around 4%. The Fed lowered interest rates three times last year. The central bank meets next week and is expected to leave rates unchanged.\n\nBut the slow and steady recovery from the inflationary heights reached after the Covid pandemic has been jolted by Donald Trump’s return to the White House. The president has stuck to his campaign promise to use tariffs against the US’s key trading partners, arguing they have taken advantage of the US and done too little to halt the flow of illegal drugs into the country.\n\nSo far, he has tacked on an extra 20% tariff on all imports from China and 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum exports from Canada. Threats of other tariffs, including a 25% tariff on all imports from Mexico and Canada, are still up in the air.\n\nThe instability of Trump’s trade policies has rocked US stock markets, which has cratered downwards over the last week.\n\nThe White House has batted away warnings that reactionary trade policies could destabilize the economy and even cause a recession. Wall Street went down even further on Monday, after Trump didn’t rule out a possible recession, saying on Sunday that the country is in “a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big”.\n\nThe Fed chair, Jerome Powell, has all but directly confirmed that the central bank will hold rates steady at its next meeting, on 18-19 March. In prepared remarks on 7 March, Powell said that the “costs of being cautious are very, very low” given that the economy is in a stable place – for now.\n\n“The economy’s fine. It doesn’t need us to do anything, really. And so we can wait, and we should wait,” Powell said.\n\nTaking pains to avoid any overtly political statements, Powell said that there is “heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook” but “it remains to be seen how these developments might affect future spending and investment”.",

        "full_text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Tuesday found that removing most grants and most staff from a U.S. federal agency that invests in African small businesses would be legal.\n\nU.S. District Judge Richard Leon also refused to extend an order blocking the Trump administration from removing the leaders of the U.S. African Development Foundation, which invests millions of dollars in African small businesses.\n\nUSADF is an independent agency created by Congress in 1980 and is controlled by board members who must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe case, filed by Ward Brehm, the president of USADF, raised questions about the extent of the president’s authority to remove board members and to reduce the size of the agency, which currently employs around 50 people.\n\nMaintaining USADF’s board, a president and one or two grants would “comply with the statutory requirements,” Leon wrote.\n\nHowever, he questioned whether the Trump administration had the power to install a board chair on a temporary basis.\n\nUSADF last week tried to keep staff from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency from entering their offices in Washington. DOGE staff managed to gain entry after returning with U.S. Marshals.\n\nLeon ordered the government to prepare those DOGE staff to explain to the court what steps they had taken to maintain the agency at “the minimum presence and function required by law.”\n\nThe judge said he would consider additional arguments for a block as the case unfolds.\n\nTrump last month in an executive order targeted USADF and three other agencies for closure in an effort to deliver on campaign promises to shrink the size of the federal government.\n\nAttorneys for the Trump administration have argued that USADF’s board has “done everything possible to avoid complying with the President’s clear directives,” and that “the President must be able to designate acting officials to fulfill his duty to enforce the laws.”\n\nCongress in 2023 allocated $46 million to USADF to invest in relatively small agricultural projects and energy infrastructure projects among other economic development initiatives in 22 African countries.\n\nIn court filings, USADF describes staff from DOGE demanding access to their systems, which staff denied citing privacy and security requirements. They also said DOGE emailed USADF’s staff last month announcing that Pete Marocco, the deputy administrator of USAID who has overseen its dismantling, would chair USADF’s board.\n\nMarocco and some of the same DOGE staff have succeeded in shuttering another independent agency, the Inter-American Foundation. On Feb. 28, a White House official told IAF staff that Marocco would chair the agency’s board, according to a letter sent to Congress by Eddy Arriola, the chair of IAF’s board.\n\nThe same day, Marocco held an emergency board meeting outside of IAF’s offices because he was not able to gain entry to the building. In notes entered into the Federal Register, Marocco said he designated himself the acting CEO and president of IAF, seemingly firing the sitting president.\n\nSince, IAF’s grants and contracts have been cancelled and most of its 37 staff members have been laid off. In 2024, IAF oversaw almost $350 million in investments in Latin American and the Caribbean, with a little more than half of that coming from outside funds, meaning from countries or private funders.\n\n___",

        "full_text": "Is the US really heading into a recession?\n\n8 days ago\n\nNatalie Sherman\n\nBBC News\n\nDuring his election campaign last year, Donald Trump promised Americans he would usher in a new era of prosperity.\n\nNow two months into his presidency, he's painting a slightly different picture.\n\nHe has warned that it will be hard to bring down prices and the public should be prepared for a \"little disturbance\" before he can bring back wealth to the US.\n\nMeanwhile, even as the latest figures indicate inflation is easing, analysts say the odds of a downturn are increasing, pointing to his policies.\n\nSo is Trump about to trigger a recession in the world's largest economy?\n\nMarkets fall and recession risks rise\n\nIn the US, a recession is defined as a prolonged and widespread decline in economic activity typically characterised by a jump in unemployment and fall in incomes.\n\nA chorus of economic analysts have warned in recent days that the risks of such a scenario are rising.\n\nA JP Morgan report put the chance of recession at 40%, up from 30% at the start of the year, warning that US policy was \"tilting away from growth\", while Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, upped the odds from 15% to 35%, citing tariffs.\n\nThe forecasts came as the S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest companies in the US sank sharply. It has now fallen to its lowest level since September in a sign of fears about the future.\n\nThe market turmoil is being driven partly by concerns about new taxes on imports, called tariffs, which Trump has introduced since he took office.\n\nHe has hit products from America's three biggest trade partners with the new duties, and threatened them more widely in moves that analysts believe will increase prices and curb growth.\n\nThe latest official inflation figures in the US showed the rate of price increases cooling in February, however.\n\nPrices were up 2.8% over the 12 months to February, down from 3% in January, the Labor Department said.\n\nStill, Trump and his economic advisers have been warning the public to be prepared for some economic pain, while appearing to dismiss the market concerns - a marked change from his first term, when he frequently cited the stock market as a measure of his own success.\n\n\"There will always be changes and adjustments,\" he said last week, in response to pleas from businesses for more certainty.\n\nThe posture has increased investor worries about his plans.\n\nGoldman Sachs last week raised its recession bets from 15% to 20%, saying it saw policy changes as \"the key risk\" to the economy. But it noted that the White House still had \"the option to pull back if the downside risks begin to look more serious\".\n\n\"If the White House remained committed to its policies even in the face of much worse data, recession risk would rise further,\" the firm's analysts warned.\n\nTariffs, uncertainty and slowing growth\n\nFor many firms, the biggest question mark is tariffs, which raise costs for US businesses by putting taxes on imports. As Trump unveils tariff plans, many companies are now facing lower profit margins, while holding off on investments and hiring as they try to figure out what the future will look like.\n\nInvestors are also worried about big cuts to the government workforce and government spending.\n\nBrian Gardner, chief of Washington policy strategy at the investment bank Stifel, said businesses and investors had thought Trump intended tariffs as a negotiating tool.\n\n\"But what the president and his cabinet are signalling is actually a bigger deal. It's a restructuring of the American economy,\" he said. \"And that's what's been driving markets in the last couple of weeks.\"\n\nThe US economy was already undergoing a slowdown, engineered in part by the central bank, which has kept interest rates higher to try to cool activity and stabilise prices.\n\nWhat are tariffs and why is Trump using them?\n\nSix things that could get more expensive\n\nIn recent weeks, some data suggests a more rapid weakening.\n\nRetail sales fell in February, confidence - which had popped after Trump's election on several surveys of consumers and businesses - has fallen, and companies including major airlines, retailers such as Walmart and Target, and manufacturers are warning of a pullback.\n\nSome analysts are worried a drop in the stock market could trigger a further clampdown in spending, especially among higher income households.\n\nThat could deliver a major hit to the US economy, which is driven by consumer spending and has grown increasingly dependent on those richer households, as lower income families face pressure from inflation.\n\nThe head of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, offered assurances in a speech last week, noting that sentiment had not been a good indicator of behaviour in recent years.\n\n\"Despite elevated levels of uncertainty, the US economy continues to be in a good place,\" he said.\n\nBut the US economy is currently deeply linked to the rest of the world, warned Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB.\n\n\"The fact that tariffs could disrupt that at the same time that there were signs that the US economy was weakening anyway ... is really fuelling recession fears,\" she says.\n\nStock market in tech ripe for correction\n\nThe unease in the stock market isn't all about Trump.\n\nInvestors were already jittery about the possibility of a correction, after big gains over the last two years, driven by the sharp run-up in tech stocks fuelled by investor optimism about artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nChipmaker Nvidia, for example, saw its share price jump from less than $15 at the start of 2023 to nearly $150 in November of last year.\n\nThat type of rise had stirred debate about an \"AI bubble\" - with investors on high alert for signs of it bursting, which would have a big impact on the stock market, regardless of the dynamics in the wider economy.\n\nNow, with views of the US economy darkening, optimism about AI is getting even harder to sustain.\n\nTech analyst Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management wrote on social media this week that his optimism had \"taken a step back\" as the chance of a recession increased \"measurably\" over the past month.\n\n\"The bottom line is that if we enter a recession, it will be extremely difficult for the AI trade to continue,\" he said.\n\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "full_text": "Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino.\n\nIn arguing for more tariffs on goods imported to the United States, President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that the U.S. was its “richest” or “wealthiest” during the late 1800s and early 1900s because of tariffs. In multiple ways, his claim is wrong or misleading.\n\nIn terms of the overall U.S. economy, real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product per capita is many times higher today than it was during the so-called Gilded Age, which was a post-Civil War period of economic prosperity – largely for the wealthy – amid the nation’s industrial expansion.\n\nIn addition, several economists have said that Trump and others have given too much credit to tariffs for the economic growth that did occur in America more than 100 years ago. For example, in a 2000 paper, Douglas Irwin, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College, wrote: “That tariffs coincided with rapid growth in the late nineteenth century does not imply a causal relationship.” Irwin and other economists and historians have said that other factors, such as immigration and increased labor productivity, contributed more to the growth in that era.\n\nBut the way Trump tells it, the U.S. was at its best economically many, many years ago, because tariffs, otherwise known as customs duties, were a significant source of federal revenue.\n\n“Our country is going to become rich again, very rich,” Trump said at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 22, when talking about new tariffs that he announced this year on imports from China and imports of steel and aluminum from all foreign countries.\n\nHe continued, “The word tariff is my favorite word in the dictionary. You know, we were richest, the richest, relatively, from, think of this, from 1870 to 1913. That was our richest because we collected tariffs from foreign countries that came in and took our jobs and took our money, took our everything, but they charged tariffs.”\n\nTrump has even made the dubious suggestion that tariffs could be used to replace the federal income tax, which became law in 1913, with the ratification of the 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Federal income taxes account for about half of federal revenue each year.\n\n“But you could wipe out your income tax. You could maybe not even have an income tax system when this thing works out,” Trump said while discussing tariffs at a dinner with Republican governors on Feb. 20.\n\n“Because in the old days that’s what happened. Our country was the richest ever from 1870 to 1913. That’s when we were actually the richest and we were a full tariff country.”\n\nTariff revenue accounted for no more than about 60% of federal receipts during that period, according to a 2024 analysis by the White House Council of Economic Advisers. And more importantly, economists have said that it’s highly unlikely that the U.S. could raise enough money from tariffs on imported goods to match current income tax revenues.\n\nIn fiscal year 2024, just 1.7% of the more than $4.9 trillion in federal receipts came from customs duties on imports.\n\nThe ‘Richest’ Claim\n\nWe don’t know exactly how Trump defines the terms “richest” or “wealthiest.” We contacted the White House press office, but have not received a response.\n\nWhen the New York Times wrote about Trump’s tariff remarks at this year’s CPAC, the newspaper said, “A White House spokeswoman noted [to the Times] that wages and the economy grew rapidly during the Gilded Age, but did not provide evidence of unparalleled prosperity in that era.”\n\nIn addition, based on real GDP per capita, Trump’s claim is false – because it is much higher now than it was more than a century ago.\n\nAs of 2022, it was $58,487 – nearly six times higher than $10,108 in 1913 and more than 12 times higher than $4,803 in 1870. That’s according to inflation-adjusted data from the Oxford University-based project Our World in Data, which calculated historical real GDP per capita based on international prices in 2011.\n\nTrump has said that, because of tariffs, the U.S. had “so much money” at that time that “we didn’t know what to do.” In that context, he may have been alluding to the fact that in many of the years between 1870 and 1913, the federal government had budget surpluses, which occur when federal receipts exceed outlays.\n\nThe president has also falsely claimed that the U.S. had “no debt” during that period, and he has often mentioned a legitimate debate that occurred in 1888 over what to do about excess federal revenue due to high tariffs. Democrats wanted to cut tariff rates to lower revenue while Republicans wanted to raise tariffs more to discourage imports and reduce revenue.\n\nBut the U.S. also has had surpluses in years when tariffs were a significantly smaller share of federal revenues — such as in the 1920s, which was after the federal income tax was enacted in 1913 and became the primary source of funding for the government by far.\n\n“This is just a function of government revenue growing faster than government spending,” Jeremy Horpedahl, associate professor of economics at the University of Central Arkansas, wrote about the surpluses in a February blog post about Trump’s “richest” claims. “And the growth of revenue during the 1870s and 1880s was largely driven by a rise in internal revenue — specifically, excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco (these taxes largely didn’t exist before the Civil War).”\n\nMost recently, the U.S. had four consecutive budget surpluses in fiscal years 1998 to 2001. At that time, tariffs made up about 1% of annual federal receipts.\n\n‘Other, Bigger’ Economic Factors\n\nIn general, some economists have said that supporters of tariffs, including Trump, have left the inaccurate impression that tariffs alone were the reason for the wider economic growth that occurred after the Civil War.\n\nFor example, in 2018, during Trump’s first term in office, Dartmouth’s Irwin did a podcast interview with American Enterprise Institute senior fellow James Pethokoukis, in which Irwin said said it was a “simplistic argument” to say that tariffs were responsible for rapid growth in the late 1800s:\n\nIrwin, Aug. 31, 2018: But when you look at that era actually in the late 19th century the U.S. was very open. We were open for immigration and we indeed had massive immigration. We were open to capital from the rest of the world and were able to borrow and purchase a lot of technology. So, it’s not as though we were an isolationist country with big barriers. Yes, we did have fairly stiff tariffs on imported manufactured goods, but otherwise we were very open to what was going on in the world economy.\n\nIn fact immigration, as I point out in the book [“Clashing Over Commerce: A History of US Trade Policy“], was actually a key instigator in terms of the development of many manufacturing industries in the United States. …\n\nIn addition, it’s become very hard actually to attribute U.S. economic growth in the late 19th century to those higher tariffs. A lot of the key improvements in technology and a lot of the growth was in the service sector: telecommunications, railroads, and things of that sort. Manufacturing really didn’t grow much as a share of GDP in the late 19th century. A lot of that grew actually in the pre-Civil War period when tariffs were actually much lower — only in the range of 20% or so.\n\nSo, there is the simplistic argument that one encounters a lot — that tariffs allowed us to grow rapidly in the late 19th century — but the more you look into it you see it’s a really tough case to make. A lot of other factors were involved and the tariffs were probably third or fourth order. And it’s not even clear they had a positive impact as opposed to a negative impact.\n\nIn his 2000 paper, Irwin said he found “that growth then was driven largely by labor force expansion and capital accumulation, while productivity growth was undistinguished when put in a comparative perspective.” He ultimately concluded that tariffs were “probably not a key factor.”\n\nLikewise, in a 2024 commentary piece, in which he cited work by Irwin and other economists, Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics and trade policy studies at the Cato Institute, wrote: “In sum, U.S. tariffs imposed after the Civil War likely helped some American manufacturers and harmed others, but they were generally neither a major driver of nor drag on the sector’s and economy’s growth, which was instead driven by other, bigger factors, such as increasing productivity and an expanding labor force.”\n\nLincicome said that “no one should expect tariffs – whether back then or today – to drive the U.S. economy given all the other, bigger factors at play and the fact that trade just is a relatively small share of economic output.”\n\nTariffs vs. Income Taxes\n\nEconomists have been just as critical of Trump’s suggestion that the revenue from higher tariffs could be a substitute for federal income tax collections.\n\nIn October, after Trump had suggested on a number of occasions that tariffs could replace the federal income tax, Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy for the Tax Foundation, wrote a column explaining why the math wouldn’t work.\n\n“Donald Trump has floated a proposal to replace the U.S. income tax system with a new system of tariffs, moving the United States back to the tax mix of the late 19th century. The plan, simply put, is a mathematical impossibility,” she wrote.\n\nYork noted that, in fiscal year 2023, the government collected $2.2 trillion from the individual income tax and only about $80 billion from tariffs. To make up the difference, Trump would have to impose an across-the-board tariff of 70% on all imported goods, she said.\n\nWhat Trump suggested “is unworkable because of the sharp difference in the size of the respective tax bases,” York wrote, noting that projected adjusted gross income was $15.6 trillion and goods imports were $3.1 trillion in fiscal 2023.\n\nSubstantially higher tariffs would also likely lead to a reduction in imports. “Trump’s calculation ignores the precipitous drop in imports a tax increase of this magnitude would cause,” she said.\n\nKimberly Clausing and Maurice Obstfeld, both senior fellows at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, made similar points in a June post that asked, “Can tariffs replace the income tax?”\n\n“Simply put, no,” was their answer. “It is literally impossible for tariffs to fully replace income taxes. Tariff rates would have to be implausibly high on such a small base of imports to replace the income tax, and as tax rates rose, the base itself would shrink as imports fall, making Trump’s $2 trillion goal unattainable.”\n\nClausing and Obstfeld said that scrapping the income tax in favor of higher tariffs would cause job losses, higher inflation, larger federal deficits and a recession.\n\n“It would also shift the tax burden away from the well off, substantially increasing the tax burden on the poor and middle class,” they argued.\n\nThe income tax is considered to be progressive because higher-income households have a higher tax burden. On the other hand, tariffs are considered to be regressive taxes because they affect lower-income households more than others as a percentage of income. U.S. importers pay the tariff, but the costs are usually passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.",

        "full_text": "There’s only one explanation for this topsy-turvy new reality in the Capitol, and it’s President Donald Trump.\n\nSeven weeks into his second term, Trump is redefining GOP orthodoxy in so many ways it’s difficult to keep track. He has shattered Republicans’ long history of muscular globalism in favor of an “America First” posture, sidelining an entire wing of the GOP. He’s leaned into protectionist economics in a way Republicans have long shunned and somehow convinced longtime free market champions to defend his policies as smart negotiating.\n\nBut the turnabout on the House floor has been especially stark. Without much drama at all, he’s convinced even the most skeptical Republicans to extend a spending deal negotiated in part by Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer — making them swallow the kind of long-term patch that both fiscal hawks and Pentagon cheerleaders have railed against for years.\n\nIt’s just the latest reminder: It’s Trump’s party, and what he says goes.\n\n“Normally I wouldn’t support the CR because I think it shows Congress is not doing our jobs,” conservative Rep. Eric Burlison (R-Mo.) told ABC News. But this time? “Trump is behind it.”\n\nIt’s not that Trump gave conservatives nothing. Many got face time, or at least call time with the president — like Burlison, who praised Trump and his staff for listening to his concerns before he agreed to get in line.\n\nAnd when I ran into Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.), one of the eight Republicans who ousted McCarthy, he pulled out a piece of paper to explain that the current bill cuts $7 billion in spending over the prior year.\n\nWhen I pointed out that was a drop in the bucket compared with the $1.6 trillion in discretionary spending that lawmakers would be extending, he sighed and agreed.\n\n“That’s not a lot of money, but it’s a start,” he said.\n\nSo if not the $7 billion, what got him to yes? Take a guess.\n\n“He’s never lied to me,” Burchett said about Trump, citing a conversation where the president promised to continue making cuts through his Department of Government Efficiency initiative.\n\nThere were through-the-looking-glass moments pretty much everywhere you went around the House on Tuesday. House Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris (R-Md.) showed up to a leadership news conference and said he was “100 percent behind this continuing resolution” — this from the leader of a group that made its name opposing GOP leaders’ spending deals.\n\n“This is not your grandfather’s continuing resolution,” Harris said, pointing to provisions that fund deportations, defense and veterans and allow DOGE to slash away at waste.\n\nHmm — okay.\n\nIt didn’t stop there. Republicans also on Tuesday almost unanimously approved a discreet provision tucked into the rule setting up the final floor vote on the spending bill. It effectively snuffed out their own ability as lawmakers to stop Trump’s emergency tariffs — tariffs that many of them railed against for years and, as they voted, were driving massive losses in U.S. financial markets.\n\nRepublicans argued the move was aimed at Democrats, who had filed privileged resolutions to terminate Trump’s emergency declarations, blocking them from being able to hijack the floor to force votes on the issue — votes that could force many swing district Republicans into an uncomfortable spot.\n\nBut by blocking Democrats, Republicans also willfully neutered their own authority, as Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) was all too happy to note on the floor.\n\n“They slipped in a little clause letting them escape ever having to debate or vote on Trump’s tariffs,” McGovern said. “Isn’t that clever?”\n\nI couldn’t help but think back to the Republican National Convention last July, when I asked Speaker Mike Johnson about how he, as a self-proclaimed free-trader, could be okay with Trump’s tariff threats. At the time, the Louisiana Republican suggested Trump’s threats were a “trial balloon” aimed at sparking debate.\n\n“I don’t think that’s President Trump’s plan,” he said at the time, promising “a lot of thoughtful discussion” and a “vigorous debate that we’ll all have” about trade policy.\n\nSome debate: Aside from McGovern’s diatribe, the tariff provision was barely mentioned on the floor Tuesday before Republicans approved it. Johnson earlier in the day defended Trump’s economic policy to reporters, saying the tariffs are needed to “start the process of repairing and restoring the economy.”\n\n“You got to give it time,” he said.\n\nYes, we’re only about 50 days into Trump’s second term, but this much we already know: With every passing moment, power is going only in one direction. And one day congressional Republicans might sober up and realize it’s not ever coming back.",

They believe these additional taxes will level the playing field.\n\nAmerica’s largest primary aluminum producer, Century Aluminum, applauded Trump’s initial reinstatement of a 25 percent tariff on primary aluminum imports in a news release last month.\n\n“President Trump’s decisive action will protect national security and help level the playing field for America’s aluminum workers,” Century Aluminum CEO Jesse Gary said.\n\n“On behalf of our employees, I thank President Trump for putting America first and strengthening the Section 232 tariffs, which will help drive the resurgence of domestic aluminum production,” Gary added.\n\nDespite concerns about an increase in the price of cars, some are in favor of the initiative.\n\nUnited Auto Workers Union president Shawn Fain told ABC News that tariffs will benefit his colleagues greatly.\n\n“Tariffs are an attempt to stop the bleeding from the hemorrhaging of jobs in America for the last 33 years,” Fain said, referencing the North American Free Trade Agreement, which began in 1992.\n\n“Tariffs aren’t the end solution, but they are a huge factor in creating, fixing the problem,” he added.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc.

        "full_text": "It would have been a dangerous drinking game during the Biden presidency to chug every time the media broadly described Jan. 6 protesters as \"insurrectionists.\" It didn't matter whether the protesters were violent or vocally supported overthrowing the government. That was the automatic journalistic assumption for every protester on the scene.\n\nSo it's remarkable when you consider the case of radical leftist Mahmoud Khalil and the group he led, Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD). On March 10, the network evening news shows didn't find an \"insurrectionist.\" They came rushing to his defense.\n\nThe Trump administration pulled Khalil's green card for his support for Hamas terrorism. Everything President Donald Trump does is reflexively opposed as unjust.\n\nNBC's Emilie Ikeda was vague: \"Khalil recently finished a masters at Columbia and helped lead pro-Palestinian protests on campus.\"\n\nABC's Aaron Katersky also said: \"As a Columbia University graduate student, Khalil helped lead pro-Palestinian protests and organized encampments that took over the campus for weeks last spring.\" Reporters pointed out his new American wife was pregnant, so Trump seems meaner.\n\nCBS reporter Lilia Luciano editorialized: \"You could feel the chill in the air which really matched the chill in terms of freedom of expression.\" CBS never found anything \"chilling\" in prosecuting nonviolent grandmas for \"parading\" in the Capitol.\n\n\"PBS News Hour\" correspondent William Brangham read from a Trump message on Truth Social that Khalil is \"a radical foreign pro-Hamas student\" who \"engaged in 'pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity.' Now, as I said, the administration has not provided any details alleging that he has said or done any of those things. We simply at this point do not know.\" They played dumb.\n\nThe New York Times on March 11 turned to Khalil's friends, who were \"describing him as kind, expressive and gentle.\" That's dramatically at odds with the Times reporting on CUAD on Oct. 9, 2024. They reported CUAD issued a statement calling the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre of innocent civilians a \"moral, military and political victory\" and quoting Ismail Haniyeh, the assassinated former political leader of Hamas.\n\n\"The Palestinian resistance is moving their struggle to a new phase of escalation and it is our duty to meet them there,\" the group wrote on Oct. 7 on Telegram. Earth to Media: They're pro-Hamas.\n\nThe Times noted CUAD rescinded an apology it made after one of its members said the school was lucky he wasn't out killing Zionists. \"We support liberation by any means necessary, including armed resistance,\" they said.\n\nKhalil has been routinely described as the \"lead negotiator\" for CUAD, but the \"no evidence\" gang at PBS somehow thinks you can't connect the dots between Khalil and CUAD. We can guess PBS reads and respects The New York Times, so they can't call this story \"disinformation.\"\n\nPBS pretends you can't find anything \"anti-American\" in CUAD's output. So it's embarrassing to note CUAD posted on social media, \"We are Westerners fighting for the total eradication of Western civilization.\" They suggest oppressed territories of the world including Hawaii, Guam, and Puerto Rico.\n\nThe New York Post reported Khalil was caught on camera at last week's hostile takeover of the Milstein Library at Barnard College: \"Videos and photographs posted on X depict him holding a bullhorn near the library entrance and engaged in discussion with school administrators.\"\n\nReasonable people can debate whether it is fair and reasonable to pull Khalil's green card and send him packing. But reasonable people should admit the reality that Khalil is an \"insurrectionist.\" He is a \"radical\" and an \"extremist.\" He embraces the murder of innocent civilians in the pursuit of \"liberation.\" He's not a kinder, gentler protester.\n\nTim Graham is director of media analysis at the Media Research Center and executive editor of the blog NewsBusters.org.",

We’re gonna make your lives s–tty.”\n\nCops blared a message on a loop warning protesters that if they remained in the roadway, they were going to be arrested and slapped with disorderly conduct charges.\n\nThe NYPD said late Tuesday one person was hit with disorderly conduct and obstructing governmental administration charges and another 11 were issued summonses.\n\nKhalil, at the center of a national firestorm, was detained Saturday by federal authorities and faces the threat of deportation for what the White House said Tuesday was peddling “pro-Hamas” views.\n\nThe arrest comes as President Trump has vowed to root out alleged antisemitism by foreign citizens on college campuses, including at Columbia, which has been a hotbed for fiery anti-Israel protests for the past year and a half.\n\nAbout 350 protesters started out at Washington Square Park earlier Tuesday and marched to Federal Plaza Immigration Court, grinding traffic to a halt multiple times as they chanted anti-Israel slogans and called for Khalil’s freedom.\n\n“There is only one solution, intifada revolution,” protesters crowed as the crowds grew to about 500.\n\nStay up to date on Columbia anti-Israel agitator Mahmoud Khalil\n\nAnti-Israel agitator Mahmoud Khalil denies feds’ claim that bedbugs drove him from NJ to Louisiana lockup\n\nWho is Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University agitator detained by ICE for deportation?\n\nColumbia anti-Israel agitator Mahmoud Khalil sues to block Columbia, Barnard from releasing student records to Congress\n\nNoor Abdalla, wife of Columbia anti-Israel agitator Mahmoud Khalil, says she was ‘naive’ to think he wouldn’t face arrest\n\nThe group was trying to make speeches in front of the federal courthouse in the middle of the street, but was ordered by the NYPD to keep moving. When the protest tried to enter City Hall Park, cops blocked marchers and forced them to turn around before the chaos unfolded.\n\nOne tourist visiting from Texas who saw the protest pass by her earlier Tuesday wondered why the protesters were hiding their faces with masks and Palestinian headscarves.\n\n“They’re embarrassed to show who they really are,” Andrea Benatar, 44, told The Post.\n\n“If they’re so proud of freeing Palestine, why not show their faces?\n\n“I’d like them to go and live in Gaza. They clearly have no sympathy for the Jewish people in Israel, including children, who were murdered and kidnapped,” she added.\n\nPolice officers also took a man into custody after he got into an argument with a protester.\n\nA demonstrator, Anastacia Symone, 30, claimed the man grabbed a young protester by the throat and took a swing at him.\n\n“I’m here to call for the release of Mahmoud Khalil. He was at home with his family when he was criminalized for expressing his freedom of speech,” Symone said.\n\nProtesters argued that Khalil was targeted because he is the “cornerstone in our community,” calling him a “political prisoner.”\n\n“The Trump administration and the complicit Columbia University believe if they separate us from this key cornerstone of our community, our movement will begin to crumble,” the protesters screamed.\n\nKhalil was being held in Louisiana ahead of a scheduled hearing before a federal judge Wednesday morning to determine the next steps in the highly controversial case.\n\nKhalil has a green card and is married to a US citizen, who is pregnant.\n\nHis legal team wants him returned to New York, arguing the federal government is “engaging in blatant efforts to target and chill” their client’s free speech and to “discriminate against particular viewpoints.”",

        "full_text": "President Trump’s sweeping tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum went into effect on Wednesday, inviting immediate retaliation from the European Union and escalating tensions with other trading partners reeling from his on-and-off approach to steep trade penalties.\n\nMr. Trump’s tariffs of 25 percent hit metal imports from every country that sells steel and aluminum to the United States. Many domestic steel and aluminum makers support the move, saying it will help protect their industry against foreign competitors. But the tariffs are expected to raise costs for American businesses that use foreign metals, including manufacturers of cars, canned food and drinks, solar panels and other products.\n\nSome trading partners have vowed to retaliate by issuing levies aimed at hurting U.S. exporters. Canada, a major supplier of metal in the United States, said that it would impose new retaliatory tariffs on $20 billion worth of American imports, including metals, computers and sporting goods. And the European Union swiftly announced tariffs on up to $28 billion worth of American goods, including bourbon, boats and motorcycles.\n\nThose conflicts could spiral into even bigger trade wars. Asked on Wednesday if he would retaliate against the E.U. tariffs, Mr. Trump said, “Of course I will respond.”\n\nMany other governments — like Japan, Australia, Mexico, Brazil and Britain — chose not to react, at least for now, for fear of worsening relations and the impact on their own economies. Those countries are also girding for the next round of Mr. Trump’s tariffs on April 2, when the president has said he will impose tariffs on foreign cars and countries that he says discriminate against the United States.\n\nMr. Trump’s recent trade moves have rocked stock markets and exacerbated concerns about the economy. Stock markets shifted between gains and losses on Wednesday as investors weighed concerns about tariffs against better-than-expected inflation data for February. Analysts have warned that Mr. Trump’s sweeping plan for tariffs could push inflation higher in the future and slow the economy.\n\nOn Monday, Goldman Sachs slashed its 2025 economic growth forecasts for the United States to 1.7 percent from 2.4 percent, citing adverse trade policy.\n\n“This may be the calm C.P.I. report before the storm,” said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, referring to the inflation data. She said that, with tariff policies, the inflation picture could potentially get “uglier as the months go on.”\n\nThe action on metals is just the latest attempt by Mr. Trump to leverage the power of tariffs and the American market against foreign governments. Last week, he issued steep tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China, blaming those countries for the entry of drugs and migrants into the United States, before quickly paring some of the tariffs back.\n\nMr. Trump’s approach has sent many U.S. allies into a defensive mode as they try to figure out how to mollify the president while also protecting their own industries. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump threatened to double the tariffs on Canadian metal after the province of Ontario responded to his previous tariffs by putting a surcharge on electricity exported to the United States. Within hours, Ontario had suspended its surcharge, and Mr. Trump walked back his threats.\n\nThe steel and aluminum tariffs restore and expand similar steps that Mr. Trump put in place in 2018, which ushered in several long-running trade spats. Mr. Trump argued that the tariffs were needed to protect national security and provide a reliable source of metal for the military in wartime.\n\nBut the metal tariffs mainly affect U.S. allies: Canada is by far the largest supplier of both steel and aluminum to the United States. Brazil, Mexico, South Korea and Vietnam also ship the United States significant amounts of steel, while the United Arab Emirates and China send the United States aluminum.\n\nSince Mr. Trump first issued the tariffs in 2018, both he and former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. made deals with foreign countries, including Brazil, Mexico, Canada and the European Union, that whittled away at the tariffs. The U.S. metals industry has complained that the measures were no longer strong enough to keep steel mills and aluminum smelters afloat.\n\nU.S. Steel, one of the country’s sole surviving makers of primary steel, has warned that it will need to shut down plants and lay off workers unless it finds a more deep-pocketed acquirer. The chief executive of Cleveland Cliffs, the country’s other primary steel maker, said that last year had been “the worst year for domestic steel demand” in over a decade.\n\n“Things would be, without those tariffs, much worse for the industry,” said Kevin Dempsey, the president of the American Iron and Steel Institute, an industry group.\n\nBecause steel and aluminum are used to make so many other products, however, tariffs that raise the price of the metals have consequences for many other manufacturers, and for the U.S. economy.\n\nBy increasing costs of basic inputs for many companies, the tariffs could harm factories that ultimately employ far more Americans than steel mills and aluminum smelters do. Economists say that could potentially backfire on Mr. Trump’s plans to bolster U.S. manufacturing.\n\nThe study found that the metal tariffs levied in 2018 encouraged buyers of steel and aluminum to purchase more from U.S. sources, led to higher domestic prices for metals and expanded U.S. steel production by about 2 percent between 2018 and 2021, the years the report studied.\n\nBut the analysis also found that the tariffs raised production costs for firms making automobiles, tools and industrial machinery, shrinking production in those and other downstream industries by about $3.48 billion in 2021. The steel and aluminum industries produced about $2.25 billion more in metals that year because of the levies.\n\nIn an effort to mitigate the harmful consequences on other industries that use steel and aluminum, the Trump administration has expanded its steel and aluminum tariffs this time to also protect various downstream goods, or “derivative products” made with metal, such as tractor parts, metal furniture and hinges.\n\nChad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a research organization, said that move was an “implicit acknowledgment” that some industries were suffering because of Mr. Trump’s previous tariffs.\n\nHe said that the tariffs created a “cycle of cascading protectionism” in which more industries would ask for government safeguards, and that it “may be difficult to stop” once it gets going.\n\n“Where does it end?” Mr. Bown asked.\n\nThe prospect of higher costs has also encouraged other U.S. industries, like automakers, to lobby for tariffs on their foreign competitors to protect their businesses. Mr. Trump has said he plans to levy a tariff on foreign cars on April 2.\n\nFor automakers, the metal tariffs threaten to raise costs when prices of new cars and trucks are already near record highs. The average price of a new vehicle in January was more than $48,000, according to Edmunds, a market research group.\n\n“Affordability is already a major concern for American car shoppers amid elevated prices and interest rates,” said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds.\n\nRobert Budway, the president of the Can Manufacturers Institute, a trade group that represents companies making cans for food, soda, beer and paint, said that tariffs would result in higher packaging costs, which would ultimately be passed to American consumers.\n\nSince Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on steel in his first term, food packagers have been relying more on imported metals, and simply paying more for them, Mr. Budway said.\n\n“It just makes the price higher,” Mr. Budway said.\n\nMajor American export industries, particularly farmers, will also be hit by retaliatory tariffs on billions of dollars of American exporters, including poultry, beef, pork and soybeans.\n\nCanadian officials said Wednesday that their retaliation would come in addition to a 25 percent tariff their government put on $30 billion of American goods this month in response to Mr. Trump’s prior levies.\n\nGabriel Brunet, a spokesman for the finance minister, Dominic LeBlanc, who is leading Canada’s trade response, said Canada was “ready to respond firmly and proportionately” to any U.S. tariffs.\n\nBritain’s trade secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, called the tariffs “disappointing.” The country was investigating steps to protect local producers and negotiating an agreement with the United States to eliminate additional measures, he said on Wednesday.\n\nBut Maros Sefcovic, the trade commissioner for the European Union, said during a news briefing Monday that the U.S. administration “does not seem to be engaging to make a deal.”\n\n“In the end, as it is said, one hand cannot clap,” he said.\n\nTrump officials have implied that, at least for the metal tariffs, deal making is not on the table. Asked what it would take to remove steel and aluminum tariffs, Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, said Wednesday that Mr. Trump views metals as “fundamental for our national security.”\n\n“The president wants steel and aluminum in America. And let me be clear, nothing’s going to stop that until we’ve got a big, strong domestic steel and aluminum capability,” he said.\n\nReporting was contributed by Neal E.

        "full_text": "The Education Department said Tuesday it will slim down to fewer than 2,200 employees, a nearly 50% reduction from what it looked like when President Trump took office.\n\nThe department said nearly 600 employees took buyouts and nearly 1,400 others will be notified they are on administrative leave.\n\n“Today’s reduction in force reflects the Department of Education’s commitment to efficiency, accountability, and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents, and teachers,” said Secretary of Education Linda McMahon.\n\nShe said all of the department’s divisions will see reductions, with some getting what she called a “significant reorganization.”\n\nIn a later interview on Fox News, Ms. McMahon said the department is shuttering its office doors on Wednesday as a security precaution. She said employees were told to take their laptops and phones with them.\n\n“Those that are coming back will know that they’ll be coming back on Thursday,” she said.\n\nThe Education Department is a relative newcomer to the Cabinet, having been created in 1980. It’s the third-youngest of the departments, older only than Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs.\n\nSince that creation, conservatives have targeted the department and question the federal government’s role in schooling. They argue that it has become a way to foist ideological fads onto local schools, who have to accept federal mandates along with Uncle Sam’s cash.\n\nDemocrats said the cuts were Mr. Trump’s first attempt at achieving such an abolition.\n\n“Ultimately, what they want to do is clear: fire the people who help our kids and gut funding for our students, teachers, and schools. This is about breaking government for working families — and enriching billionaires like themselves in the process,” said Sen. Patty Murray, the senior Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n\nMs. McMahon, though, said she’s not cutting any education. She characterized the moves as slashing bureaucracy and returning more decisions to local control and to parents themselves.\n\nShe said the department will continue to make payments on programs such as Pell Grants and student loans and on spending under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Those tasks, she said, are required by law.\n\nMs. McMahon was confirmed by the Senate last week and showed signs in her Fox interview of still getting up to speed. At one point she stumbled over what IDEA stood for.\n\n“You know what? I’m not sure I can tell you exactly what it stands for, except that it’s the programs for disabled and needs,” she said. “This is my fifth day on the job. I’m really trying to learn it.”\n\nThe department had 4,133 employees on Inauguration Day and will soon be down to roughly 2,183.\n\nThe department said 259 employees took the Deferred Resignation Program, dubbed the Trump administration buyout. Some 313 others took a $25,000 Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment.\n\nThe difference will be made up in the administrative leave announcements to come later this month.\n\nThose being let go will be paid in full up through June 9 and will get “substantial” retirement or severance pay based upon their time on the job.\n\nRep. Rosa DeLauro, Connecticut Democrat, called the staff cuts illegal.\n\n“No president or member of the executive branch has the authority to end public education, violate the law, and unilaterally steal dollars promised to students,” she said.\n\nBut Tommy Schultz, CEO of the American Federation for Children, said Ms. McMahon’s move is a blow to teachers unions “who care only about preserving their own power.”\n\n“This news is another signal that the bureaucratic state is coming to an end in America, ushering in a golden age in American education that is centered on sending education back to the states and parents,” he said.",

        "full_text": "One day ahead of a court hearing for Mahmoud Khalil -- the Palestinian activist who was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on the campus of Columbia University, despite possessing a green card -- his wife and attorney both released statements shedding more light on Khalil's detainment and the days leading up to it.\n\nKhalil's wife, who is eight months pregnant, issued a statement speaking of the outpouring of love she has received and the urgent need for him to be home in time for their baby's birth.\n\nIn it, she said that Khalil \"begged\" Columbia University for legal support one day before his arrest, explaining that he was fearful that ICE might target him.\n\nKhalil allegedly sent an email to the university urging them to intervene, his wife said.\n\n\"I haven't been able to sleep, fearing that ICE or a dangerous individual might come to my home. I urgently need legal support and I urge you to intervene,\" he reportedly said in his email.\n\nHis wife claimed that the university never responded.\n\nABC News reached out to Columbia for comment and has not independently reviewed the reported emails.\n\nKhalil's wife also said in her statement that a \"doxxing\" campaign began targeting her husband about six days ago and anti-Palestinian groups were also spreading \"false claims\" about him.\n\nShe recalled the moment she was also threatened with arrest when she refused to leave her husband with the agents, claiming that the couple was never shown a warrant.\n\n\"I was born and raised in the Midwest. My parents came here from Syria, carrying their stories of the oppressive regime there that made life unlivable. They believed living in the US would bring a sense of safety and stability. But here I am, 40 years after my parents immigrated here, and just weeks before I'm due to give birth to our first child, and I feel more unsafe and unstable than I have in my entire life,\" her statement said.\n\nThe Trump administration said it detained Khalil, who was a leader of the encampment protests on Columbia's campus, alleging he was a supporter of Hamas.\n\nBaher Azmy, one of the lawyers representing Khalil, called his client's alleged alignment with Hamas \"false and preposterous.\"\n\nAccording to a joint letter filed in court and obtained by ABC News, the government and Khalil's attorneys conferred on Monday but were unable to agree on how to proceed. Khalil's side asked the court to first decide a pending motion to compel the government to return him to New York; the government indicated that it intends to move to dismiss or transfer the case for improper venue and is asking the court to address that first.\n\n\"For everyone reading this, I urge you to see Mahmoud through my eyes as a loving husband and the future father to our baby. I need your help to bring Mahmoud home, so he is here beside me, holding my hand in the delivery room as we welcome our first child into this world. Please release Mahmoud Now,\" the statement from Khalil's wife concluded.\n\nAttorney Amy E. Greer said she spoke with Khalil on Tuesday and that he is \"healthy and his spirits are undaunted by his predicament.\"\n\n\"He also greatly appreciates, and, typically for him, is moved by the extraordinarily broad and steadfast support he has received from a variety of communities that understand what is at stake,\" she said.\n\nGreer also hinted that some of the administration's comments about Khalil, including President Donald Trump's social media posts, may be used by his legal team to argue for his release.\n\n\"The remarks by government officials, including the President, on social media only confirm the purpose – and illegality – of Mahmoud's detention. He was chosen as an example to stifle entirely lawful dissent in violation of the First Amendment. While tomorrow or thereafter the government may cite the law or process, that toothpaste is out of the tube and irreversibly so. The government's objective is as transparent as it is unlawful, and our role as Mahmoud's lawyers is to ensure it does not prevail,\" Greer said.\n\nThe court has scheduled a hearing on the habeas petition on Wednesday at 11:30 a.m.\n\nKhalil's team will be asking the court to order the government to return him to New York to while the legal battle plays out. Khalil is currently being held in Louisiana -- a move that Greer claimed is a \"blatantly improper but familiar tactic designed to frustrate the New York federal court's jurisdiction.\"",

        "full_text": "Dalvin Modore walked as if there were broken glass beneath his feet, stepping gingerly, his frail shoulders hunched against the anticipation of pain. His trousers had become so loose that he had to hold them up as he inched around his small farm in western Kenya.\n\nMr. Modore has tuberculosis. He is 40, a tall man whose weight has dropped to 110 pounds. He has a wracking cough and sometimes vomits blood. He fears the disease will kill him and has been desperate to be on medication to treat it.\n\nMr. Modore is one of thousands of Kenyans, and hundreds of thousands of people worldwide, with TB who have lost access to treatments and testing in the weeks since the Trump administration slashed foreign aid and withdrew funding for health programs around the globe.\n\nMany, like Mr. Modore, have grown significantly sicker. As they go about their lives, waiting and hoping, they are spreading the disease, to others in their own families, communities and beyond.\n\nThe whole system of finding, diagnosing and treating tuberculosis — which kills more people worldwide than any other infectious disease — has collapsed in dozens of countries across Africa and Asia since President Trump ordered the aid freeze on Jan. 20, Inauguration Day.\n\nThe United States contributed about half of international donor funding to TB last year and here in Kenya paid for an array of essentials. Trump administration officials have said that other countries should contribute a greater share to global health programs. They say the administration is evaluating foreign aid contracts to determine whether they are in the national interest of the United States.\n\nWhile some of the TB programs may ultimately survive, none have received any money for months.\n\nFamily members of infected people are not being put on preventive therapy. Infected adults are sharing rooms in crowded Nairobi tenements, and infected children are sleeping four to a bed with their siblings. Parents who took their sick children to get tested the day before Mr. Trump was inaugurated are still waiting to hear if their children have tuberculosis. And people who have the near-totally drug-resistant form of tuberculosis are not being treated.\n\nDespite being fully treatable, tuberculosis claimed 1.25 million lives in 2023, the last year for which data is available. If TB begins to spread unchecked, people throughout the world could become at risk.\n\nThe main TB research effort, testing new diagnostics and therapies, has been terminated. The global procurement agency for TB medications lost its funds, then was told it might regain them, but still has not. Stop TB, the global consortium of government and patient groups that coordinates tuberculosis tracking and treatment, was terminated, had the termination rescinded, but still has received no funds.\n\nThe United States did not pay for all the TB care in Kenya, but it funded critical pieces. And when those were frozen, it was enough to bring the entire system to a halt.\n\nThe United States paid for motorbike drivers, who earned about $1 for transporting a sample taken from a person with a presumptive infection to a lab to test it for TB. The drivers were fired on the first day of the funding cut — so the transportation of samples stopped.\n\nThe United States paid for some laboratory equipment used to process tests. In many places, processing stopped.\n\nThe United States paid for the internet connectivity that allowed many testing sites to send results back to far-off patients via local community advocates known as TB Champions. So even when patients found a way to send samples to a working lab, notification of results stopped.\n\nWithout testing that confirms whether a person is infected and what type of TB they have, family members cannot start on preventive therapy.\n\nThe United States paid for the half-dozen tests that patients need before beginning treatment for multi-drug-resistant TB, to make sure their bodies will be able to tolerate the harsh drugs. These tests can cost $80 or more, beyond the reach of many patients. Without the tests, clinicians don’t know what drugs to prescribe very sick patients. Prescriptions stopped.\n\nThe United States paid for the ships and trucks that moved drugs to ports and on to warehouses and clinics. Shipments stopped.\n\nEvaline Kibuchi, the national coordinator for the Stop TB Partnership in Kenya, predicted that it would take only three months before infections and deaths from TB increased. “But we won’t even know about the new deaths, because all the data collection was supported by U.S.A.I.D.,” she said.\n\nThe United States also paid the stipends — about $35 a month — of community health workers, and TB Champions, who lost the tiny salaries that belie their vital role. Research has shown that because TB treatment involves taking drugs for many months, often with miserable side effects, patients are much more likely to finish a course of medication and be cured when someone is checking on them regularly, cheering them on and watching for lapses.\n\nBut across Kenya, the community advocates have kept working, unpaid, covering the costs of trying to reach patients and delivering diagnoses out of their own pockets.\n\nMr. Modore’s constant cough drew neighborhood attention in January. Doreen Kikuyu, the TB Champion in his area, came and collected a sputum sample from him and used the motorbike system to send it for diagnosis.\n\nBy the time his results came back, the Trump administration had frozen the system. Ms. Kikuyu could not get funds for a motorbike to take her to his home to inform him. “But I could not leave him without knowing the answer,” she said. “So I set out walking.”\n\nShe also explained that the lab analysis did not provide information on whether he had a drug-resistant form, so he would need further testing before he could start the proper medication. But he would have to pay 1,000 Kenyan shillings — about $8 — to send a sample to the regional laboratory that could do this test. To pay for it, they might need to sell a chicken, one of their few assets. They debated what to do as the days ticked by.\n\n“I’m really hoping to start on medication but I’m just left wondering what will happen,” Mr. Modore said one recent afternoon, sitting hunched in the shade of a stand of trees outside his house.\n\nEventually, the intrepid Ms. Kikuyu managed to scrape together the money, by gathering contributions from other now-fired community health workers and neighbors. She sent the sample to the lab. Good news came back: Mr. Modore did not have drug resistance and could take the standard medications.\n\nBut there was no one to prescribe them. The staff members at the clinic were paid by the United States, and they were now fired. Ms. Kikuyu was at her wit’s end, knowing Mr. Modore was desperately ill.\n\nWorking her phone, using airtime she bought herself, she badgered a local government TB official who is a clinician to meet her at the hospital and to prescribe and issue the drugs from the shuttered clinic storeroom. She scraped together more money to bring Mr. Modore to the clinic on a motorbike. As she watched him grin and take his first pills, she felt a flood of relief.\n\nBut immediately, she faced a new worry: His family and close neighbors, about a dozen people, needed to start preventive therapy to protect them from getting sick too. The clinic is closed. If she can find a clinician to prescribe drugs for the adults, at least, she could deliver them. (TB drugs for children are complex and require a doctor’s supervision.) But she’s out of money to get back to the Modore home. She has worn herself out walking to the homes of other patients who are waiting for tests, waiting for results, waiting for drugs.\n\n“It’s a problem,” she said wearily. “But we have to get to that family.”\n\nFor TB treatment to work, patients must take their drugs every day, without interruption, for months.\n\nBarack Odima, a 38-year-old mechanic in Nairobi, has the most deadly form of the disease, one that is resistant to most treatments. Last fall he started on a rare drug combination, but when he went to pick up his medication two weeks ago, the clinic staff told him that one of the drugs had not been restocked and that they had nothing for him.\n\n“If I don’t get this drug that is missing, how will I be cured?” Mr. Odima said.\n\nAfter another week, the clinic received a small batch of medications. The clinician and the pharmacist had been laid off, so a TB Champion gave him the medication — but could not tell him how many more pills he might receive.\n\nWhile he is on the drugs, Mr. Odima is supposed to have monthly testing of his blood, liver and kidneys to make sure his body is tolerating them. That costs about $80, previously covered by the U.S. grant, and he has not had a test since the funding freeze. Mr. Odima’s wife and five children are supposed to be rechecked for the disease this month; it will take all his savings to pay for X-rays.\n\nIn an interview in a clinic treatment room plastered with stickers and posters advertising U.S.A.I.D. support, Mr. Odima said he was grateful to the United States for assisting with his treatment, but was baffled that the country had cut off help. Of course his own government should provide such care, he said. “But we are a dependent country,” he said, “and Kenya is not able to support the programs so that all the people with these diseases can get cured.”\n\nIn truth, the TB treatment system in Kenya was none too sturdy before the United States yanked its support — the country had nearly 90,000 new infections last year. Labs ran short of supplies to do molecular tests, and people were often misdiagnosed.\n\nThe TB Champions, who drop in to check in on anyone they hear about with a persistent cough, were intended as a low-budget, high-impact strategy to change that. Since the aid freeze, they have taken on outsize importance. In the scruffy western Kenyan town of Busia, a Champion named Agnes Okose is using the money she earns from her snack stall to fund trips to outlying villages. Since late January, she has been delivering diagnoses and collecting sputum samples in plastic sample jars she buys herself, toting them in a small lunch cooler to a laboratory in town.\n\nBut because all the TB and H.I.V. cases have gone to the separate clinics for years, clinicians in the main facilities don’t know about drug protocols, side effects or signs of treatment failure.\n\n“You will have health care workers who have never seen a TB case; there will be quality-of-care issues,” said Dr. Timothy Malika, who oversees the TB program of Kisumu County, which has one of the highest rates of TB infection in Kenya.\n\nAbigael Wanga, who lives in a village in Busia County, has five children; two have taken TB treatment for a year. But the two children, Philemon, 8, who hopes to be a pilot one day, and his headstrong sister Desma, 3, still have chest pain and coughs, and no appetite.\n\nMs. Okose fears they are drug-resistant. She collected sputum samples from them and their three siblings the day before the inauguration. The testing is frozen, and all five children continue to sleep under one blanket at night.",

        "full_text": "With Congress acquiescing to all of Trump's wishes and the courts stacked in his favor, many are concerned about an unbridled president. To the rescue comes the market.\n\nBy Sergei Klebnikov and Matt Schifrin\n\nThis past Thursday, President Trump did it again–and so did the financial markets. In a Truth Social post, Trump said that he would be carrying through next week on his previously delayed threat to slap 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods because (he said) these neighbors weren’t doing enough to stop drugs at the border. Then, in the oval office later, he said China would get hit with an additional 10% levy—taking the total to 20%. The market’s response was swift and unambiguous. The S&P 500 closed down 1.6% for the day, taking it into negative territory for 2025, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ closed down 2.8%, off 3.8% for this year. By contrast the MSCI European stock index is up nearly 11% and MSCI China stock index has gained 17%.\n\nWhat the erratic 47th President will do next week is an open question. But investors can at least be sure, based on his performance both during his last term and this one, that Trump is paying attention to the market. On February 1, after he initially signed three executive orders declaring these tariffs, stocks plummeted the next morning. They recovered a few days later after Trump “paused” what a majority of economists view as an ill-conceived proposal.\n\nA failure of checks and balances. A strongman presidency. Constitutional crisis. After just a few weeks in office, these are the words echoing in the halls of power as President Trump and Elon Musk steamroll through federal agencies. So far, there’s no pushback from a Republican controlled Congress and it’s unclear if the judiciary will intervene. Given his fake news rhetoric, Trump is certainly not worried about media reports, traditionally a strong external check on presidential power. After all, his own supporters don’t trust the mainstream media.\n\nBut there is one authority that President Trump seems to recognize: the market.\n\n“Trump is a president who has more closely aligned his own success with the stock market than any other president in US history,” says Jeremy Siegel, a Wharton emeritus professor and WisdomTree senior economist. “The market is the ultimate check, especially for a president who cares.”\n\nWhile stocks surged higher following Trump’s reelection in November, cracks have now started to emerge in the rally. Along with stocks, Bitcoin prices have retreated 20% from their Trump-infused highs.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, his announcement of 25% tariffs on China in March 2018 caused markets to tank nearly 5% in a week. While that escalated into an all out trade war with China in 2019, by 2020 Trump backed down and signed a trade agreement.\n\n“It is instructive that in the trade war in his first term, Trump was willing and able to pivot when the economic damage caused by that war became apparent, easing tensions with the Chinese,” wrote Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi in a recent report. “We expect a similar dynamic this time as well.”\n\nGrowing up in Queens, New York–and for decades seeking the approval of Manhattan’s market rich elite–Trump has many Wall Street billionaires within his inner circle. So it is hardly any surprise that he has always been highly sensitive and attuned to financial markets and their movements. In December, Trump triumphantly rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange while standing in front of his 2024 Time “Person of the Year” cover. (It was his first time ringing the bell, and he brought along his children and Vice-President Elect J.D. Vance for the occasion.)\n\nThe bond market may be an even more important check than the stock market for Trump, especially considering that the nation’s $36 trillion in debt needs continual refinancing. There is no greater cautionary tale than the experience of short-lived British Prime Minister Liz Truss. After taking office in September 2022, she boldly announced she would slash taxes and ramp up borrowing. This widespread fear over inflation and mounting debt quickly caused bond prices to plummet, sending yields sky high as the British pound plunged to a record low against the U.S. Dollar. With several pension funds on the brink of default, the Bank of England had to announce three emergency interventions to save the bond market. Within three weeks, Truss had scrapped her tax cutting plan and resigned.\n\nWhile the prospect of a United States President resigning over a drubbing by the capital markets is farfetched, Truss’ implosion is instructive. Bond vigilantes are likely to keep President Trump on his toes. Things like the adherence to the rule of law matter a lot to the entities that buy and hold United States government paper.\n\nIn terms of interest rates, 10-year Treasury yields have come down since Trump assumed office from about 4.8% to around 4.2% today. However, mortgage rates (and inflation) remain problematic. According to Freddie Mac, 30-year fixed home mortgage rates, which recently rose above 7%, are hovering around 6.76% today.\n\nRight now the Trump administration is riding on the coattails of the Biden Administration’s strong economy, which averaged about 3.6% GDP growth from 2021 through 2024. That compares to Trump’s 1.5% average annual GDP growth during his first term.\n\nThe test will come if President Trump encounters a real crisis, not of his own making, like the Financial Crisis of 2008, which occurred at the end of President George W. Bush’s second term. As is often the case during times of economic turmoil, the market guided the nation’s leadership. When the House of Representatives in 2008 voted down the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) bailout on September 29, the S&P 500 plunged nearly 9% in four days before members of the House reconsidered the plan and approved the bill on October 3.\n\nDuring Trump's first term he tried to downplay the Covid 19 pandemic but the global shutdown, and a stock market plummeting more than 30% in a matter of weeks, jolted his administration and Congress into action. The result was $5 trillion in stimulus over two years, that buoyed markets then and ever since.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES\n\nForbesBillionaires Don’t Want Trump’s Golden VisaForbesTrumpiverse: Ranking Trump’s Inner CircleForbesForbes Post-Election Investment Guide: Protect Your WealthForbesIgnore Musk’s And Trump’s Wild Claims.

Fewer than 60,000 people live on the island, and most are part of an Indigenous Inuit background, while around 10% are Danish or Nordic. Trump has said he wants the U.S. to have access to the island’s rich mineral deposits.\n\n“I think most of us have been scared since the new year because of (Trump’s) interest,” Pipaluk Lynge, a member of parliament from the ruling United Inuit party, told The Associated Press. “So we’re really, really looking to Europe right now to see if we could establish a stronger bond with them to secure our sovereign nation.”\n\nTraffic jams, huge crowds and lots of foreign media characterize Greenland’s elections\n\nVoters have turned out in abundance to make their voices heard. According to reports, roads are clogged with those trying to get to the polls. Party volunteers are passing out drinks and Greenlandic treats in an effort to entice voters to stop and talk. Large numbers of foreign reporters, including from places as removed from Greenland as Japan and Croatia, are on the island.\n\n“All these reporters are frightening to us,’’ said voter Aviaja Sinkbaek. “It means that something must be happening soon. I wonder what Trump has up his sleeve.”\n\nSome Greenlanders have expressed interest in expanding Greenland’s business relationships.\n\nThe populist Naleraq party, led by candidate Qupanuk Olsen, is advocating for independence while also pressing for security agreements with foreign nations like the United States, per Fox News.\n\nSuch proposals may not be enough to sway Trump from his dreams of expansion, although 85% of Greenlanders say they do not want to join the United States according to a January poll.\n\nGreenland’s current left-leaning ruling party, led by Prime Minister Mute Egede, has indicated staunch opposition to Trump. His party is expected to prevail in the Tuesday election.\n\nTrump’s interest in Greenland\n\nTrump’s interest in Greenland is rooted back to 2019, when he first suggested buying Greenland, per AP News.\n\nIn addition to annexing Greenland, Trump has suggested:\n\nAnnexing Canada as the “51st state.” Trump has repeated his desire to appropriate Canada multiple times. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has indicated that he is taking Trump seriously and has criticized him fiercely for his remarks.\n\nTaking control of the Panama Canal.

We are ready to INVEST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS to create new jobs and MAKE YOU RICH.”\n\nHe then added: “If you so choose, we welcome you to be a part of the Greatest Nation anywhere in the World, the United States of America!”",

        "full_text": "Next month, Ecuadorian voters will choose between incumbent conservative President Daniel Noboa and progressive challenger Luisa González to be their next president. This will be the second presidential election of 2025, following the February general election in which no candidate secured the 50 percent needed to win outright(Noboa and González both earned about 44 percent of the vote).\n\nNoboa, Ecuador's youngest president and heir to a banana empire, took office in 2023 to complete the term of former President Guillermo Lasso, who dissolved the National Assembly that year—for the first time in Ecuador's history—to avoid an impeachment vote for his alleged role in a corruption scandal involving oil and gas contracts.\n\nNoboa inherited a tumultuous situation—from 2018 to 2022, Ecuador's murder rate quadrupled. Just two months into office, he declared a 60-day state of emergency in seven of the country's 24 provinces. The order designated 22 criminal gangs as terrorist groups, allowed the military to patrol streets, and authorized security forces to \"enter homes and intercept correspondence in the targeted provinces without prior authorization,\" reported Reuters. In January, Noboa issued a second 60-day crime emergency.\n\nThese policies initially led to a drop in the homicide rate, which fell by 17 percent through August 2024. However, the decline was short-lived—January was the most violent in Ecuador's history, with 731 homicides reported, according to InsightCrime, a nonprofit that tracks crime in Latin America.\n\nUnder Noboa, Ecuador's economy fell into recession, largely due to an energy crisis caused by droughts that reduced the country's supply of hydropower—its main source of electricity. As a result, blackouts lasted up to 14 hours a day, costing an estimated $12 million in lost productivity and sales for every hour without power. In the fourth quarter of 2024, gross domestic product fell by 1.5 percent year-on-year, while the poverty rate increased by 2 percent.\n\nIf reelected, Noboa plans to double down on tough-on-crime policies, including the construction of a $52 million, 800-person maximum-security prison to house the country's most dangerous drug lords, which he authorized in June 2024. His economic agenda focuses on resolving the energy crisis—though details remain vague—and reducing poverty by expanding social programs and wealth transfers, such as the \"Bono de Desarrollo Humano,\" which provides stipends of $55 to $150 to impoverished families.\n\nLuisa González, who ran against Noboa in the 2023 election, was handpicked by former President Rafael Correa (2007-2017). Correa was sentenced to prison in absentia in 2020 on corruption charges, according to the Associated Press.\n\nDespite her close ties with Correa, González has stated that she would not intervene in his legal matters and has denied any intention to pardon him if elected.\n\nGonzález plans to address Ecuador's crime wave similarly to Noboa—through a strong military and police presence—by fully deploying security forces to the borders to regain control and targeting drug lords.\n\nGonzález has also campaigned on reinstating the Ministry of Justice, Human Rights, and Worship to improve rehabilitation programs. The ministry, created during the Correa administration, was responsible for coordinating the justice system, overseeing human rights within prisons, and improving rehabilitation efforts for inmates. However, it was dismantled in 2018 as part of a government initiative to reduce spending and downsize the government. After its dissolution, prison responsibilities were transferred to the National Comprehensive Service to Prisoners and Juvenile Offenders. Since then, there have been several human rights accusations of the treatment of prisoners.\n\nHer economic plans include transitioning Ecuador to a post-oil economy—despite oil meeting 82 percent of the country's energy needs—and increasing social spending, signaling a return to Correa-era policies. Specifically, she plans to expand social spending in violent areas, reduce the sales tax from 15 percent to 12 percent, and provide tax credits for women-owned businesses.\n\nDespite their differing economic strategies, both candidates advocate expanding state power in the name of public safety. Regardless of the outcome, voters may suffer if these policies are implemented.",

        "full_text": "I was open to the idea behind Gavin Newsom’s new podcast, in which the California governor has been breaking out of his political bubble to talk at length with right-wing media stars such as Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon. Democrats need to get better at speaking to people who don’t share their assumptions and at long-form conversations requiring improvisation and spontaneity. They need to be willing to take risks and to use conflict to generate attention.\n\nNewsom himself did just that in 2023 when he debated Ron DeSantis on Fox News, drawing almost five million live viewers, plus 700,000 more for the replay. Trying to leverage Kirk’s and Bannon’s notoriety to reach new audiences could have been an interesting experiment.\n\nInstead, it’s a protracted exercise in self-harm for both Newsom and any liberal who decides to listen to him. That’s because the governor frequently seems less interested in arguing than in finding common ground, assuming the good faith of people who have next to none. He leaves wild right-wing claims unchallenged and repeatedly concedes Republican premises. When Bannon described rebuilding his movement after what he claimed was the stolen 2020 election, Newsom’s response was, “Well, I appreciate the notion of agency.”\n\nWhat could have been a show of intellectual confidence on Newsom’s part has turned out to be a demeaning display of submission.\n\nListening to the first three episodes of the podcast, “This Is Gavin Newsom,” I got the sense that Newsom had learned exactly the wrong lesson from Donald Trump’s 2024 election. Part of the reason Trump won, it’s true, is that he was able to appeal to increasingly alienated, right-wing young men through podcasts and new media. As Newsom told Kirk, the governor’s 13-year-old son is one of his fans. “We’re getting clobbered,” Newsom said at one point, and “you’ve figured something out.”\n\nBut while there is, in fact, a lot that Democrats can learn from Kirk and Bannon about building alternative media channels, there is nothing to be gained by flattering them or seeking mutual understanding.\n\nIn his podcast’s debut episode, Newsom asked Kirk to describe his professional trajectory. The story that Kirk told contained some important omissions. Yes, he built a following in part by charging onto left-leaning college campuses and challenging his opponents to debate, thrilling conservative students who felt ostracized by their progressive peers. But Kirk was misleading in presenting Turning Point USA, the organization of young conservatives he founded, as the “ultimate start-up,” created without money or connections.\n\nAs a teenager, Kirk was mentored by the Tea Party activist Bill Montgomery, who described himself as Turning Point’s co-founder, and the group got seed money from the evangelical megadonor Foster Friess. There’s obviously a genuine audience for what Kirk is selling, but he wouldn’t have become such a political powerhouse without wealthy and influential figures cultivating him over many years.\n\nThat’s the lesson for Democrats. Their donors should be making long-term investments in their own influencers, and Democratic politicians should be helping them grow their audiences by appearing on their platforms. Somehow, this is something Democrats never quite learn.\n\nMore than 20 years ago, the Democratic strategist Rob Stein put together an enormously influential PowerPoint presentation called “The Conservative Message Machine’s Money Matrix,” laying out how right-wing donors supported an interlocking network of think tanks, policy institutes, nonprofits and media ventures. But while Democratic donors have tried, at times, to create a similar infrastructure on the left, they tend to be more fickle and less willing to nurture and sustain a pipeline of young talent.\n\nOutlets like Air America and ThinkProgress that helped start the careers of important figures in the liberal firmament — Rachel Maddow among them — have been allowed to wither and die, and then Democrats wonder where all their young voices are. Rather than try to ingratiate himself with Kirk, Newsom might try to elevate the progressives who could someday compete with him.\n\nIt was especially ill advised for Newsom to roll out his pivot on trans women in sports in a conversation with Kirk, a man who once described trans people as “disgusting, mentally ill, neurotic, predatory freaks.” As a matter of both political expediency and simple honesty, Democrats should be able to acknowledge that it’s unfair to expect elite female athletes to compete against trans women who’ve gone through male puberty. But at a time when the Trump administration has singled trans people out for persecution, Democrats need to couple their recognition of physical difference with a broader defense of trans rights.\n\nInstead, Newsom emphasized how much he and Kirk agreed about. “The issue of fairness is completely legit,” he said. “So I completely align with you. And we’ve got to own that.”\n\nIf the governor was aware of the things Kirk has said about trans people, he should have called him on it. If he wasn’t, perhaps it’s because it takes work to prepare to engage a demagogue and Newsom already has a full-time job.\n\nFuture guests on “This Is Gavin Newsom” will include liberals; an episode with Tim Walz has already been recorded. But I suspect that by starting his show the way he did, Newsom has done lasting damage to his standing among Democrats, who are desperate for leaders who will fight on their behalf, not seek communion with their enemies.\n\nLast week I got an email from Michael Green, a history professor who ended up on a McCarthyite Turning Point watch list because he’d said mean things about Trump. “I had thought of Newsom as a possibility if we have a presidential election in 2028,” wrote Green. “He just lost me. Completely.” I doubt Green’s alone.",

        "full_text": "“Universal injunctions have reached epidemic proportions since the start of the current Administration,” acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris told the high court Thursday.\n\nThe Trump administration and its allies argue that the tactic of blocking executive actions nationwide early into litigation — paired with what is known as “forum-” or “judge-shopping,” in which plaintiffs seek out favorable courts — has been used to obstruct executive authority, a problem that has persisted long before Trump first took office in 2016.\n\n“It’s an issue that’s been ongoing in a large way, for about 20 years,” Cassandra Burke Robertson, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University, told the Washington Examiner. “I think it is well past time for a congressional solution.”\n\nHow are nationwide injunctions and judge-shopping tied together?\n\nMany of the challenges to Trump’s policies have landed in friendly jurisdictions, though often not by accident. District courts that fall under the purview of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, known for its liberal rulings, are one example of a common target destination for liberal advocacy groups and Democratic attorneys general.\n\nAlso on Thursday, U.S. District Judge William Alsup, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton in California, issued a sweeping order requiring six federal agencies to reinstate immediately thousands of probationary employees fired by the administration last month. When the administration appeals, it will move to the 9th Circuit for review. The lawsuit is backed by the State Democracy Defenders Fund, a left-leaning group headed by Norm Eisen, a staunch Trump critic and Democrat.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt criticized Alsup’s decision in a statement Thursday, saying, “The President has the authority to exercise the power of the entire executive branch — singular district court judges cannot abuse the power of the entire judiciary to thwart the President’s agenda.”\n\nConservative litigants have also engaged in similar tactics in the past. In 2023, Texas-based U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, ruled in favor of anti-abortion activists seeking to ban the abortion pill mifepristone, a move that enraged abortion-rights advocates and led to similar left-wing complaints about forum shopping. However, the Supreme Court eventually unwound the decision, finding plaintiffs lacked standing to sue, after the conservative-leaning 5th Circuit partially upheld Kacsmaryk’s original decision.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee, warned in 2020 that nationwide injunctions create an “asymmetric” legal battlefield in which any policy can be halted by one judge, even if others would uphold it.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, expressed similar frustration last week after the Supreme Court declined to block a single district court judge’s order forcing the Trump administration to pay $2 billion in foreign aid.\n\n“Does a single district-court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the Government of the United States to pay out (and probably lose forever) 2 billion taxpayer dollars?” Alito wrote in a scathing dissent, calling the majority’s decision “stunning.”\n\nTrump’s recent nationwide setback over DEI\n\nAdding to the frustration, a recent ruling by U.S. District Judge Adam B. Abelson, an appointee of Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden, further illustrates the stakes of judges heavily using nationwide injunctions.\n\nIn a challenge to Trump’s executive orders (EO 14151 and EO 14173), Abelson on March 11 expanded his preliminary injunction blocking the anti-diversity, equity, and inclusion policies across all federal agencies — not just the ones named in the lawsuit.\n\nSupreme Court has a chance to address this problem\n\nThe Supreme Court faces a chance to rein in nationwide injunctions later this year. In Garland v. Texas Top Cop Shop, justices may decide whether lower courts have overstepped their authority in halting federal policies.\n\nThe case centers on a Texas judge, Amos Mazzant, an appointee of former President Barack Obama who ruled that a federal law requiring businesses to disclose ownership information was unconstitutional. But Mazzant went further — he issued a nationwide injunction preventing the government from enforcing the law at all.\n\nJust before Trump took office, the Biden administration urged the Supreme Court to reexamine Mazzant’s decision. While the merits of the case involve the Corporate Transparency Act, an anti-money-laundering law, experts say an outcome in which the CTA is upheld could result in advising trial judges to issue more targeted orders that apply solely to the plaintiffs involved.\n\nThe push for legislative reform\n\nIn a statement echoing Alito’s concerns, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told the Washington Examiner the ability for a single district judge to “unilaterally micromanage the executive branch should raise eyebrows.”\n\n“Both parties have raised serious questions about district courts’ use of temporary restraining orders and universal injunctions to issue sweeping, nationwide policy mandates, and I think Congress ought to closely examine the issue,” Grassley added.\n\nRobertson, the law professor, told the Washington Examiner an easy solution could in the hands of Congress, such as with legislation requiring three-judge panels for plaintiffs in district court who are seeking nationwide injunctions.\n\n“I think part of the issue is actually driven by the congressional gridlock we’ve seen on policy issues for the last 20 years,” Robertson said. “That has really pushed both Democratic and Republican administrations to do more by executive order and through administrative actions.”\n\nRobertson’s proposal would mandate that cases involving nationwide injunctions be heard by a panel of two district judges and one appellate judge from the same circuit. The goal is to reduce the influence of outlier judges and make it harder for plaintiffs to pick judges in district courts that may be more prone to favor them.\n\nFor example, the Fort Worth Division has two conservative judges, making it a prime venue for right-wing challenges to Democratic policies. In contrast, Portland, part of the District of Oregon, has six judges across multiple divisions, and its liberal-leaning judiciary makes it a favored venue for left-wing lawsuits against Republican policies.\n\n“When a single judge can grant a nationwide preliminary injunction, it makes it easier for parties to identify the very few outlier judges who do rule more predictably,” Robertson said. A similar legislative approach has been floated by Article III Project founder Mike Davis, a staunch ally of Trump.\n\nBoth Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), a ranking member of the committee, and Grassley have raised issues with nationwide injunctions and judge shopping. In April 2024, Durbin received calls from progressive groups urging him to use his oversight authority to address the issue.\n\nGrassley told the Washington Examiner that he hopes “to explore the topic further through a future hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee,” and said he was “actively working towards a legislative solution.”\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nTRUMP BATTLES ‘FORUM SHOPPING’ AMID LIBERAL LAWSUIT SURGE\n\nLegislative efforts remain uncertain. While proposals from both Robertson and Davis signal a possible fix to the bipartisan concern, past attempts, such as a Senate Democratic bill that would have randomly assigned cases, have stalled in Congress.\n\nAs Trump now faces over 100 lawsuits against his executive agenda, the fight over judicial power is far from over.",

        "full_text": "In the past week, Donald Trump announced that he would buy a Tesla and advertised the company’s vehicles at an event that turned the White House lawn into a showroom benefitting his ally, Tesla CEO Elon Musk. He also said that vandalizing Tesla cars — as some demonstrators have done to protest Musk — will be labeled an act of “domestic terrorism.”\n\nIt’s the latest and perhaps most egregious example of the conflicts of interest that have ensnared both Trump and Musk, who is leading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a role that has given the world’s richest man the ability to target and gut any government agency that draws his ire.\n\nThis isn’t anything new. Trump’s first term was riddled with unprecedented conflicts of interest. Yet this time around, Trump came into office with even more business entanglements and ways to use the presidency to enrich himself. His social media company, Truth Social, is now a publicly traded company, giving anyone the ability to become a shareholder in the president’s business. He and his family members have launched crypto coins. And Trump also has a new set of merchandise licensing deals.\n\nBut when it comes to just how unprecedented the conflicts of interest are in this administration, the Tesla incident shows that Musk is the new elephant in the room. The businessman, who became one of the president’s closest advisers after spending hundreds of millions of dollars to help Trump win, is now directly influencing agencies tasked with regulating his own companies. And of course other Trump appointees and nominees — from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to Dr. Mehmet Oz, Trump’s pick to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services — are not free from conflicts of interest either.\n\nAt this point, the public seems resigned to the fact that people in power also have massive incentives to enrich themselves. But in truth, there are people and processes that are supposed to protect us from this kind of abuse. What are they, how have they broken down, and how can we get them to work?\n\nHow the government polices itself\n\nA conflict of interest arises when an official’s personal interests can cloud their judgement when making decisions on behalf of the public. When foreign officials, for example, spend money at Trump’s businesses, they create a conflict of interest for the president because he materially benefits from his relationship with them. And while some conflicts of interest are inevitable and not inherently corrupt, they do increase the risk of corruption, where officials intentionally advance their own personal interests instead of national ones.\n\nEvery branch of government has ethics standards and conflict of interest rules. Though as the ethics scandals with Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas have shown, they’re not always enforced.\n\nIn the executive branch, conflicts of interest are determined by statutes that apply to all federal employees — like the law prohibiting someone from working on matters where they have a financial interest — and ethics rules that are set up by the White House.\n\nOne major limitation, though, is that these conflict of interest laws do not apply to the president or vice president, which is why Trump is allowed to maintain all of his businesses while serving in the White House.\n\nAs for Musk, there’s a reason he hasn’t been subject to the same ethics standards as most other government employees. “The administration has taken pretty significant steps to insulate Mr. Musk from accountability,” said Donald Sherman, the executive director and chief counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). “So they made him a special government employee instead of a permanent employee, so he’s working for the federal government while also maintaining his day job.”\n\nThe administration has pointed to that special status — usually given to short-term advisers who sit on temporary advisory committees or task forces — as a reason why Musk doesn’t have to make his financial disclosure form public, limiting scrutiny into his businesses’ entanglements. (Past administrations have also dubiously granted people special government employee status, as was the case when Huma Abedin worked as an aide to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton while maintaining an outside consulting job.)\n\nSo who is responsible for actually enforcing existing conflict of interest rules where they can be applied?\n\n“Primarily that has been — within the executive branch — the Office of Government Ethics,” said Eric Petry, who serves as counsel in the Brennan Center’s Elections and Government Program. “There’s also a robust system of inspectors general, who are supposed to expose fraud and waste and conflicts.”\n\nThe Office of Government Ethics (OGE) was formed after the Watergate scandal. Before then, conflict of interest cases were mostly handled through criminal investigations and proceedings, but OGE was established to help prevent conflicts of interest from arising in the first place. Tasked with scrutinizing the president’s political appointees, the office reviews their financial disclosures, identifies areas where conflicts of interest might arise, and proposes ethics agreements to address those conflicts, including by requiring appointees to sell assets. OGE also maintains a database of officials’ disclosures, which are generally available to the public.\n\nInspectors general also play an important role. They are an independent watchdog within a given agency and conduct audits and investigations to ensure that the agency and its employees are complying with the law and to prevent fraud and abuse. While their investigations usually come in the form of a public report, inspectors general can also make referrals to the Department of Justice, where criminal violations can be prosecuted.\n\n“But,” as Petry notes, “you’ve seen the Trump administration has really been putting those systems under stress or just outright ignoring them.”\n\nIndeed, Trump has engaged in a full-on assault on these watchdogs, firing the director of OGE as well as at least 17 inspectors general across various federal agencies. Trump’s moves also underscore the potential conflicts of interest at play. At least one of the inspectors general he fired was overseeing an investigation into one of Musk’s companies. To put it mildly, these firings — which are potentially unlawful — are a major setback for the executive branch’s ability to police itself.\n\nObviously, that’s by design. From day one, Trump has shown little interest in promoting ethical conduct. One of his first executive orders, for example, rescinded Biden-era ethics rules that prohibited employees from accepting gifts from lobbyists. To be sure, while other administrations haven’t exactly been squeaky clean, the way the Trump administration has handled ethics concerns is a departure from its predecessors.\n\n“Unfortunately within the executive branch, some of the tools that we typically look to to police conflicts are not going to be effective,” Petry said. “So that means we look to the other branches of government.”\n\nCongress and the courts need to step up\n\nThis administration’s flagrant disregard for ethics rules underscores that the regulations we already have are clearly not enough. “It’s a real problem that federal conflicts-of-interest laws don’t apply to the president and vice president,” Petry said. “That’s something that Congress can and should change. There are problems here that are sort of systemic that require reform.” After Trump left office in 2021, there were some efforts to bolster ethics standards and oversight, and ensure that the president and vice president are no longer exempt from conflict of interest rules. But those efforts largely failed.\n\nStill, the different branches of government have to make an active effort to hold each other accountable. Since Trump has undermined the ability of the executive branch to hold itself accountable, the Congress and the courts have to be more vigilant.\n\nIt might seem like it’s expecting too much of a Republican-controlled Congress to investigate potential conflicts of interests, but that’s the legislative branch’s job. It’s also not unheard of. During Trump’s first term, Republican lawmakers oversaw inquiries into the president’s appointees. Former US Rep. Jason Chaffetz, of Utah, for example, called out Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, for potentially violating the law for not properly disclosing payments from foreign governments. (Flynn pleaded guilty for lying to law enforcement, but the Department of Justice eventually dropped its case against him and Trump granted him a pardon in 2020.)\n\nWhere Congress falls short, the courts can step in. Trump’s firing of the inspectors general, for example, is improper because he neither gave Congress a 30-day notice, as required by law, nor provided a substantive reason for the inspectors general dismissals. So some of those inspectors general have filed a lawsuit against Trump, saying their firing was “contrary to the rule of law.”\n\n“Unfortunately this moment of chaos could be really painful for a lot of people, but hopefully it will generate the backlash and public momentum for changing the system that we saw following the Gilded Age, following Watergate, following other periods of crisis and constitutional uncertainty,” Petry said.\n\nThat’s why the last line of defense against the conflicts of interest plaguing the Trump administration is important. And that is the role of the press and government watchdog groups.\n\nTrump has been able to evade accountability in part because he is more immune to public shaming than other public officials. His corruption has always been brazen and often out in the open. As a result, many people seem desensitized to this kind of abuse of presidential power.\n\nBut while public shaming might not work as effectively on Trump, it can pressure other officials and institutions to take action. Even when there aren’t specific remedies to Trump’s or Musk’s conflicts of interest, shedding light on them for the public to see is an important accountability mechanism because people can demand more of their representatives in government and put pressure on the administration. So the public shouldn’t be resigned to the idea that ethics rules are somehow moot under Trump.\n\nAfter all, that’s who lawmakers will have to answer to come election time. And it’s likely that voters will have some questions about who this administration is really serving.\n\n“You don’t need to be an ethics expert,” Sherman, of CREW, said, “to have significant questions about how this administration is operating and whether or not conduct rises to the level of a violation of federal or criminal law.”",

        "full_text": "Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino.\n\nAs we reported in January, President Donald Trump inherited a resilient economy experiencing continued growth in jobs, including an increase in full-time workers. But Republican Sen. Rick Scott recently painted a much different picture, calling the pre-Trump economy “crappy” and falsely claiming that full-time employment was “dropping almost the entire Biden administration.”\n\nThe U.S. senator from Florida made the claim during a March 9 interview on CNN’s “State of the Union.” After the show’s host, Jake Tapper, asked Scott about Trump’s recent admission that the president’s economic policies may cause “a little disturbance” for Americans, Scott began his response by first blaming former President Joe Biden.\n\n“Well, first off, Donald Trump walked in with a crappy economy,” Scott said. “The number of full-time jobs has been dropping almost the entire Biden administration. This is a lot of work.”\n\nWe asked Scott’s Senate office for the source of his claim, but we did not receive a response.\n\nHe’s wrong about full-time employment, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\n\nWhen Biden left office in January, the number of people usually working full time — meaning 35 hours or more a week — was almost 135.9 million. That was up 8.5% from about 125.2 million full-time workers when Biden became president in January 2021, during the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic that began in March 2020. In February, that figure dropped to about 134.7 million.\n\nNotably, the January 2025 total is higher than the February 2020 pre-pandemic level of almost 130.9 million usual full-time employees. (The monthly job figures come from a survey based on the pay period that includes the 12th of the month.)\n\nIf Scott was thinking of monthly job losses, there were 17 months under Biden in which the number of full-time workers declined on a month-to-month basis. But full-time employment grew the other 31 months of Biden’s term, resulting in a net increase.\n\nFor additional context, the share of workers usually working full time was 80.7% in 2023, the most recent annual BLS data available. In 2022, it was 81.9%; in 2021, Biden’s first year in office, it was 81.8%; in 2020, the first year of the pandemic, it was 80.9%; and in 2019, prior to the pandemic, it was 80.8%.\n\nAs for Scott’s claim that Trump took over a “crappy economy,” that is part of a GOP narrative suggesting that Trump has to repair an economy in poor condition.\n\nIn a March 11 House Republicans’ press briefing that touched on Trump’s tariff policies, Speaker Mike Johnson said that Trump has “to reshape and shape things because it’s in a real mess” after “four years” of “a disaster in economic policy and every other measurement of public policy.”\n\nDuring his March 4 address to Congress, Trump made the exaggerated claim that he “inherited, from the last administration, an economic catastrophe.”\n\nTo be sure, the state of the economy wasn’t perfect when Trump began his second term. But it wasn’t “crappy” or a “catastrophe,” either. In our January article “What Trump Inherits, Part 2,” we mentioned a number of economic indicators that could be interpreted as positive.\n\nWe reported that Trump was reclaiming “a resilient economy that has grown by at least 2.5% every year since he left office in early 2021”; “a post-pandemic jobs boom that has driven the unemployment rate well below the historical norm”; “inflation that has come down significantly in the past two years, but has been creeping up as of late”; and “a stock market that has made huge gains since he was last president.”\n\nIn a March 12 interview with NewsNation, Maryland University professor and economist Peter Morici also noted that “inflation has come down quite a bit” — from 9.1% in the 12-month period ending in June 2022 to 2.8% in February — and “the economy was growing well” under Biden.\n\nAnd back in December, IBM Vice Chair Gary Cohn, who was the director of the White House National Economic Council during Trump’s first term, said in an interview on CBS’ “Face the Nation” that Trump was inheriting a “very stable economy” with “real solid economic growth,” “real job growth” and “real wage growth.”\n\n“This notion that he inherited a bad economy is just silly,” Morici said, referring to Trump.",

        "full_text": "‘He’ll Do the Hard Thing’\n\n“Everybody has that voice in their head,” John Thune once told a reporter from the Rapid City Journal. He was talking about his father. “He’s kind of that voice inside my head,” he said, “the one that knows where the lines and the boundaries are.”\n\nHarold Thune was born in Mitchell, South Dakota, on Dec. 28, 1919. The son of an immigrant from Norway — Nikolai Gjelsvik became Nick Thune when he arrived at Ellis Island in 1906 — he grew up on the high plains in Murdo, a small, sparse, windswept spot in which earlier settlers had sought shelter in huts made of sod. He was a basketball standout, first leading Murdo to the state championship game, then becoming at the University of Minnesota the most valuable player on the team. At a Minneapolis soda shop he met a Canadian-born clerk who’d lost her railroad-worker father in accident when she was not yet 3. Harold Thune and Yvonne Patricia Bodine got married after he’d enlisted in the Navy after Pearl Harbor, and he was sent to the Pacific after that. He flew more than 60 missions off the USS Intrepid. In his Grumman Hellcat he downed four Japanese Mitsubishi “Zeros” and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. “You always wanted to keep the enemy off your tail,” he once said. The Japanese military’s “‘Zero’ was a lighter plane and could outturn the planes that we flew.” One way to win a fight, he learned, was to rely on experience and nerve. Another way, he came to believe, was to try to not have one in the first place.\n\nOn many mornings Thune’s mother sang in the house in her soprano. The sun is a-rising to welcome the day. High-ho! Come to the fair! “She had a way,” Thune would say, in the Murdo Coyote newspaper, “of making you like the day, whether you wanted to or not.” She had her kids read, even in the summer, an hour every day. She saw to it that they took piano lessons before school. Thune’s father saw to it that they did the lessons right. He sat with them to make sure. His father, Thune once said, didn’t like “ball hogs.” He didn’t like people who prized “personal glory.” The best members of a team, his father stressed, did what they did for “the good of the team.” The best members of a team, he believed, made the other members better.\n\nThune as a basketball star missed the last shot he took. It was the end of a one-point loss to the archrival in the championship of the district. “It wasn’t like it was a cupcake shot. It was a long ways away,” Brian O’Reilly, one of his teammates, told me. “Everybody in the gym knew John was going to get the ball, and of course they double- and triple-teamed him, and he tried his best,” Chris Venard, another one of his teammates, told me. “I don’t think anybody blamed him,” he said. “He blamed himself.” He sat alone in the locker room until his coach and his mentor tapped him on the shoulder. “John,” Jerry Applebee said, “it’s time to get on the bus.”\n\nThe motto of Jones County High School’s Class of 1979: “Today, we follow; tomorrow, we lead.”\n\n“John has always wanted to serve and to do what’s right,” his father once told a reporter. “He told me if the hard thing is the right thing to do,” he said, “he’ll do the hard thing.”\n\n‘John’s a Follower’\n\nHe conceded.\n\nThe real beginning of Thune’s long electoral career could have been the end. He was already better than a decade deep in his political life. From the mid-’80s to the mid-’90s, he’d been an eager aide to Republican Sen. James Abdnor, a special assistant for the U.S. Small Business Administration, the executive director for the South Dakota Republican Party and the South Dakota Municipal League, the state railroad director.\n\nIn 1996, he’d run for Congress and won. “There’s an old saying that organizational change comes from gentle pressure relentlessly applied,” he told NPR. “You do things incrementally. And you do it in a fashion that promotes,” he said, “a spirit of cooperation, and that’s really the only way you can get things accomplished.”\n\nAnd in 2002, in his third term in Congress, he’d thought about running for governor, but President George W. Bush helped sell him on a run for the Senate — a potential pivotal vote in an evenly cleaved chamber. But in the end, he’d lost to Tim Johnson, the incumbent Democrat — by 524 votes. Some whispered of rumors of fraud on the Native American reservations in the state. Thune spurned calls to challenge the results. He did not, he said, want to put South Dakota “through a lengthy recount which would not guarantee my victory or fix any irregularities” and “would be painful for the state and unlikely to change the outcome.”\n\n“He competes. I mean, he competes,” Karl Adam, a lobbyist in Pierre who’s a longtime Thune friend, told me. “But John’s not a disruptor.”\n\nAlso, though, Thune “set himself up” for a run to come, Fox News’ Michael Barone said at the time, “by not being a poor loser.”\n\nAnd so two years later, he decided to run again — this time, though, against Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader who had been the Senate majority leader, the top Democrat in Washington. It was seen as a very tall task, and at stake was his political career — lose for the Senate for the second time in three years and he was probably done. But it was “a race that needed to be run,” Thune said at the time. “He just felt,” Dick Wadhams, his campaign manager, told me, “it was the right thing to do.”\n\nBush was running against John Kerry for president, but the New York Times dubbed Thune-Daschle “the other big race of 2004.” The thrust of Thune’s case: After 26 years in Congress, Daschle had lost touch with South Dakota and become too Washington-enmeshed. “There is negativity and partisanship going on in Washington, and Daschle has become a symbol of why things don’t get done,” Thune said in a fundraising letter. “I’m proud to be a member of my party,” he said in an ad, pitching himself as a more independent option. “But … no party is right all the time.”\n\nDaschle countered by saying Thune had had a chance to oppose Bush a couple years before during a flap about a dearth of federal drought relief for South Dakota. In a debate on NBC’s Meet the Press, host Tim Russert asked Thune why he hadn’t more forcefully called that out. He had, Thune replied, shared his concerns — in private. Daschle suggested that wasn’t enough. “John’s a follower, and I think there’s something to be said for following, but you’ve got to be more than a follower in the United States Senate,” Daschle said.\n\nThune won. He beat Daschle by 4,508 votes — a little more than a percentage point — the first time in 52 years a sitting Senate leader had lost. It marked a lasting shift in the political makeup of South Dakota — a resolutely conservative state that throughout the latter half of the 20th century nonetheless had sent its fair share of Democrats to Congress. Not anymore. “That was kind of it for the Democrats in South Dakota,” Tony Venhuizen, the current lieutenant governor, told me. Time magazine labeled Thune a “Giant Killer,” and the Sunday after the election, he was on ABC’s “This Week” as the Republican counterpart to the Democrats’ new leading light — Senator-elect Barack Obama.\n\nIn Washington, in his first term in the Senate, Thune carried on with an approach he’d established in his six years in the House, according to staffers, allies and watchers of Congress from both parties. He scheduled with fellow members dinners or Bible studies. He had an uncanny capacity to remember names — aides, colleagues, spouses and kids. He was known as a good boss, conspicuously minimal churn on his staff, people who worked for him often working for him for an unusually long time. He was reliably ready in the halls of the Hill to banter with reporters to make and maintain rapport. He listened more than he spoke. He waited and he watched. Seldom was he a first mover. “He’s a skilled hunter,” Kyle Downey, his top communications adviser early in his Senate tenure, told me, “so he’d often say, ‘Let’s just keep our powder dry.’”\n\nIn 2008, he not only endorsed John McCain for president but campaigned for him. There was more than political admiration. There was something of a personal connection. His father had received his Distinguished Flying Cross Award from McCain’s grandfather. And Thune was on the list for the vice-presidential nod — the one that went instead to Sarah Palin. In 2010, he was reelected without opposition. And he thought hard about running for president heading toward 2012. “If he wins the nomination, it will be because he is an exceptionally skilled retail politician who can communicate a kind of midwestern, common sense conservatism that is ascendant in reaction to liberal profligacy,” Stephen F. Hayes wrote in The Weekly Standard. Mitch McConnell was a fan. “I think he’s the complete package and is the kind of person who could conceivably go the distance in a race for the presidency,” McConnell, then the Senate minority leader, told Hayes. The GOP field was open. Obama, seeking his second term, seemed vulnerable.\n\n‘A Very Challenging Time To Be In Public Life’\n\nAnd then down the escalator came Trump.\n\nThune at first didn’t think much of Trump’s run. He didn’t think it would last. “A short-term phenomenon,” he said that summer of 2015. “He’s someone who grabs attention,” he said, “but does he have the potential to go the distance?”\n\nAs Trump, though, started to surge, Thune started to shift — even if the shift was slight. “There is no denying that Donald Trump has struck a chord with voters throughout the country,” he said. “It has been the summer of Trump for sure,” he said. “But,” he said, “I think there will be other people who will emerge.”\n\nThey did not. And by December, when Trump floated the notion of banning Muslims from entry into the country, National Journal asked the question: Is there a line Trump can’t cross with Republicans? Thune in effect was inclined to leave it to the voters. Trump’s comments about Muslims were “not consistent with the values and beliefs that we hold as a nation,” he said. “I think in the end,” he also said, “we will nominate a candidate that can lead our party in the general election.”\n\nThat, in 2016, is what happened — just not how Thune thought it would. He didn’t go to the Republican National Convention. He spoke up when Trump attacked Gold Star parents who spoke out against Trump at the Democratic National Convention. “Donald Trump,” Thune said, “has to develop a thicker skin, realize that these campaigns and elections are not about him. It’s about the future of this country.”\n\nAnd in early October, in the wake of the shock of the Access Hollywood tape, Thune was the seniormost Republican to finally in essence answer that National Journal question. Here was the line. Trump, he thought, should leave the race — “should withdraw,” Thune said in a tweet, “and Mike Pence should be our nominee effective immediately.” Thune said the recording was “more offensive than anything I’ve ever seen.” But even this answer came with a clause: If, he said, the top-of-the-ticket GOP option remained Trump, Thune would vote for Trump.\n\nSo he did, and so, of course, did nearly 63 million others, and so in 2017 Thune established a certain template to the way he dealt with and talked about Trump. Trump’s baseless insistence that he’d won the popular vote and desire for an investigation into fraud? Thune “had not seen any evidence” of that, but “we’ve moved on,” he said in January. Trump’s eye-opening and unsubstantiated charge that former President Barack Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower? “Boy, I have no idea,” Thune told POLITICO in March. Trump’s quest to quash Obamacare? “We are proceeding according to plan,” Thune said in May. “But,” he said, “less drama on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue would be a good thing.” And so it went — Thune backing Trump in his health care-repeal and tax-cut initiatives while lamenting his inveterate feud-picking and wanly wishing he would stop tweeting, eventually settling on a sort of Pavlovian posture that was pragmatic, or acquiescent, or both. The man from Murdo didn’t not push back against the man from Manhattan — he just didn’t call him out. Thune was no sycophant — nor, though, was he some stance-taking crusader.\n\nThune’s M.O. was a dependable level of trying to find the thinnest of middle grounds that some found measured and others found milquetoast. It wasn’t always outright equivocation. But it was also never downright condemnation. Once at a concession stand at a basketball game in South Dakota a man told him he wasn’t sufficiently pro-Trump and he turned around and another man said he wasn’t suitably anti-Trump. “I know a lot of people are unhappy with him, and they vent a lot to me on a regular basis, too, but what they have to understand is he was elected by a big majority in South Dakota,” Thune said that summer at the Brown County Fair. “To me,” he told a reporter from the Aberdeen American News, “it’s about being a realist, and to be a realist about my work. I know what it takes to get things done in Congress, and I know that it takes a president to sign legislation into law, and we’ve got to be able to function together to do that.”\n\nThat didn’t change in 2019, and neither, really, did Thune — now the GOP whip. “I wish he wouldn’t tweet as much,” he said in January. “There are concerns, and our members are conveying those,” he said in February. “A bridge too far,” Thune said in March of Trump’s proposal to declare a national emergency to get money to build more border wall. He tried to get Trump to back off of tariffs. He expressed disapproval of Trump’s conduct that led to his first impeachment but also the Democrat-led impeachment itself. He voted to acquit. “There is a real concern out there that the behavior of the president … obviously isn’t what some of our members would condone, but at the same time it didn’t reach that threshold that would allow him to be removed from office,” he said on the PBS NewsHour. But was what the president did, he was asked, wrong? “At this point,” Thune said, “it’s kind of a discussion that is past us.”\n\nAnd as the first Trump administration careened toward its chaotic conclusion — the pandemic, the murder of George Floyd and the fallout, the president’s increasingly manic comportment — Thune urged him to listen to health professionals and to strike a tone that was more “calm,” more “reassuring,” more “empathetic.” When Trump wouldn’t commit to a peaceful transition of power? Thune said that couldn’t happen. “Republicans believe in the rule of law,” he said in September. “We believe in the Constitution.” And in November, after Trump lost, Thune balked at helping him challenge the certification of his defeat. “It’s just not going anywhere,” he said. “I mean, in the Senate, it would go down like a shot dog.” Trump responded on Twitter as if Thune were a declared enemy: “He will be primaried in 2022, political career over!!!” Trump said — at which point Thune shifted some. “We are letting people vote their conscience,” he told reporters at the Capitol. “This is an issue that’s incredibly consequential, incredibly rare historically and very precedent-setting,” he said. But then Jan. 6, 2021, happened. It seemed for a moment that Trump indeed was done and done for good, and Thune, in turn, seemed to rediscover his resolve.\n\n“Today,” Thune said on Jan. 6, “has been a sad day for America. The violent behavior at the Capitol is inexcusable and disgusting, but we won’t be deterred from our Constitutional duty. We need to work together to protect our democracy. Please pray for our country.”\n\n“Our identity for the past several years now has been built around an individual. You got to get back to where it’s built around a set of ideals and principles and policies,” he said. “I think people — including the president and others around him and other voices and in media circles and social-media platforms — have been putting out false facts and then getting people to believe those things now for weeks,” he said, “and it’s just time for it to stop.”\n\nAnd yet in the subsequent and second impeachment Thune voted again to acquit. “What former President Trump did to undermine faith in our election system and disrupt the peaceful transfer of power is inexcusable,” he said. But impeachment, Thune explained, was meant for removal from office, and Trump was already out of office, and impeaching him after his ouster, he argued, would take the power out of the hands of the voters.\n\nIt had been a long four years. “There was just kind of a shift in 2016 where everything just kind of changed,” a former Thune staffer told me. “Just all the things … got harder.” Thune thought hard about not running for reelection in 2022. One reason was the chance to spend more time with his wife, his daughters and his grandkids — but another was Trump, the durability of his political viability, the looming possibility or even probability of his return.\n\nHe made his choice. He ran again.\n\n“He saw,” Mike Rounds, his fellow senator from South Dakota, told me, “there was a possibility of becoming the leader …”\n\nHow long had Thune wanted to be leader?\n\n“I think,” Rounds said, “he’s wanted to be a leader since he got here.”\n\nBut he wanted to be the Senate majority leader working with a Republican president who wasn’t Donald Trump. In the 2024 primary — after Rounds did the same — Thune endorsed Tim Scott.\n\nBut Trump won the South Carolina primary on Feb. 24 and with it for all intents and purposes the GOP nomination. Thune called him that night. He endorsed him the next day. And he announced his candidacy for leader a week later. He made a trip to Mar-a-Lago shortly thereafter. He said he’d worked with him before. He said he could work with him again.\n\n“We’re more animated these days by the personality of Donald Trump, and that’s the reality we live with and deal with if you want to be involved in public life,” Thune said after he announced his bid to succeed McConnell. “That’s kind of where our voters are,” he said. “And you have to listen to your voters.”\n\n“God wants us to be out there being salt and light in the culture,” he said when he won. “I want to be a hopeful, optimistic leader,” he said, “a leader who’s willing to do hard things, make hard decisions.”\n\n‘My Guess Is That He’s at Least Somewhat Tortured’\n\nThe fire in the fireplace in the office of the leader on the Senate side of the Capitol was smoking. The eyes of the wall-mounted head of a bison named Murdo were watching. The other day, toward the tail end of 10 straight weeks of the Senate in session, going on two months into the second Trump term and with the specter of a government shutdown in the air, the trim Thune wore a blue suit and sat down to talk.\n\nI asked him about that voice in his head of his dad. The one that knows where the lines and the boundaries are. “People I’ve talked to, Democrats, too, admire you for knowing where the line is,” I said. “Where in this moment,” I asked, “is that line?”\n\n“Well,” he said, “I mean, I think that you have to pick and choose your battles. And obviously right now I think this is an adjustment phase that we’re in. We’ve got an administration that’s incredibly aggressive, that’s moving quickly and decisively, and to the Democrats’ displeasure — in their view, too quickly, too decisively — but I think at the end of the day it’s defending the prerogatives of the institution. I mean, I think the Senate, as an institution and the Article I branch of the government, constitutionally has a role to play, and I think it’s important that the leader understand and be willing to defend the institution and preserve its unique role in our democracy …”\n\n“In what ways in the last two months,” I said, “have you as leader defended the prerogatives of the institution?”\n\n“A willingness to adhere to the rules. Everything we’ve done so far with regard to nominees, notwithstanding a lot of pressure to break the rules and do things differently and all kind of recess appointments — there are lots of ideas being thrown around out there — we’ve done it the old-fashioned way, and we have just ground things out, pounded away at getting the job done. And I think there’s always a lot of pressure from — and there was in the first time around, in the first Trump term, to get rid of the filibuster — and we resist that because we understand the unique role that the founders had for the Senate,” Thune said. “There are constantly threats to and efforts to undermine the Senate’s role.”\n\n“Have you,” I said, “said to the president at any point, That’s our job, not yours?”\n\n“I don’t know if I’ve said it exactly that way,” Thune said with a laugh. “It might’ve been a little bit more diplomatic …”\n\n“But you’ve said a version of that, privately, diplomatically?”\n\n“Or when asked by people — whether it’s the president or people around him or people who share some of his views on how we should do things around here — I think,” Thune said, “I’ve been very clear.”\n\nPeople who know him well these days sometimes watch him and worry about the toll this job is taking. The people who raised him are gone. His mother and Abdnor died in 2012. His father died, at 100 years old, in 2020. Coach Jerry Applebee died just this January. Now his older brother. “My prayer for him,” his younger brother Tim told me, “is don’t let Washington corrupt you. You’re John Thune. You’re the kid from Murdo. Stay the kid from Murdo. Don’t let Washington corrupt you.”\n\nHe has to this point as leader of the Senate in this country’s 119th Congress compiled a record of what some see as accomplishment and what others consider accommodation. He toasted Trump at his inauguration. “We’re not looking backwards, we’re looking forward,” he said of the Jan. 6 pardons. “This is not unusual for an administration to pause funding,” he said of the aid freeze. “The president is somebody who sees great value in the use of tariffs as a tool, and we’ll have, I’m sure, lots of conversations,” Thune said of Trump’s tariffs that could have massive consequences for among many others his own farming constituents in South Dakota. He’s “put some ideas out there,” he said of Trump’s musing about taking over Gaza and making it a seaside resort. “Anything that DOGE does will be factored into what we do here,” he said of the activities of Elon Musk. “The American people handed him a decisive mandate,” he said. “It’s important we honor that mandate by confirming his nominees as quickly as possible,” he said. He’s praised Trump’s picks for his Cabinet. “We’re trending in the right direction,” he said. And in the aftermath of the Oval Office blowup between Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, even as some fellow Senate Republicans reacted with great consternation — “I am sick to my stomach as the administration appears to be walking away from our allies and embracing Putin, a threat to democracy and U.S. values,” said Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski — Thune did what he does. “No question in my mind that Russia is the aggressor,” he told South Dakota’s Mitchell Republic. But he didn’t clearly criticize the interaction or Trump’s part, calling the meeting “spirited” and pointing to the future. “Obviously,” he said, “there will have to be some subsequent follow-up meetings that occur, but hopefully they got some of that out of their system …” Thune aides say his relationship with Trump has never been better.\n\n“Talk about the right person being in the right place at the right time,” Scott Howell, the longtime Thune consultant, told me. “The years of his service have culminated in this moment,” Steve Daines, the Montana senator and Thune confidant, told me. “He’s smart enough,” Larry Rhoden, the South Dakota governor, told me, “to get behind Trump, lock, stock and barrel,”\n\nBut Thune’s role, which is to say the role of the Senate, is not exclusively or even primarily to work with the president and enact the agenda of the executive, according to his critics. The Senate, in the words of James Madison, is supposed to “protect the people against the transient impressions in which they themselves might be led.” The Senate, in the words of Mike Mansfield, history’s longest-serving Senate majority leader, is “one of the foundations of the Constitution” — “one of the rocks of the Republic.”\n\nAnd the current majority leader? “You are in an extraordinary position now to curb this presidency and keep it in bounds,” Ken Kemp said this month in his latest open letter to Thune. “I was trying to appeal to the better angels of his nature, because they’re there,” Kemp told me. “I’ve been waiting to see you take your stand,” Kemp wrote. “I’m still waiting and hoping.”\n\n“The next year or two will tell a lot about what matters to him and how much it matters,” longtime Tom Daschle adviser Pete Stavrianos told me. “On one side you have his ambition, and on the other side you have what he believes in about our system, and democracy and the prerogatives of the Senate,” he said. “My guess he’s at least somewhat tortured on the inside.”\n\n“It’s not an overstatement, it really isn’t, to say the fate of our democracy and our country may be determined by a single decision that he makes,” Drey Samuelson, the former Tim Johnson chief of staff, told me.\n\n“It’s a damn shame,” Mark Salter, the longtime John McCain adviser, told me. “God,” he said. “It’s just not worth it. Your time is so finite. It’s so brief. Your life is brief. But your time in public life is briefer. And when you’re gone,” he said, “you’re gone.”\n\nThis week in his office Thune brought up David Brooks without me having to ask. “David Brooks talks about resume virtues and eulogy virtues,” he told me. “I went to my brother’s funeral in California here not long ago,” he said. “I was reminded of the importance of eulogy virtues.”\n\nIn what ways, I wondered, is what he’s doing right now and how he’s doing it “resume” work, and in what ways is it “eulogy” work?\n\n“I think sometimes what you do might be considered resume work,” he said. “I think how you do it is considered more eulogy work.”\n\n“You listened to what people said about your brother,” I said to Thune. “What do you think people will say about you at your service?”\n\n“Well,” he said, “that chapter’s probably still being written.”\n\n“What do you think they will say about this particular moment in time, this role that you’re playing right now?”",

        "full_text": "House Democrats are livid. The progressive grassroots is aghast. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), after taking a victory lap after the first cloture vote on the House GOP’s continuing resolution, which would fund the government for another six months, totally caved yesterday. He’s going to vote to keep the government open. Republicans needed a handful of Democratic votes to get to 60. They didn’t have it on Tuesday. They will soon, with Schumer and now Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) announcing they’d support keeping the government open.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor once, House Democrats are angrier with their own party than Donald Trump. It’s ironic: the liberal media and the Democrats expected GOP disarray and chaos, and this shutdown fight sparked a civil war among themselves. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who Schumer is rumored to be wary of regarding a primary challenge, might have been given the push she needs to plan on that front. But first, she’s mobilizing House Democrats against Mr. Schumer (via CNN):\n\nNew York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Thursday that she plans to mobilize her massive base of followers to oppose what she described as an “acquiesce” by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to accept the House GOP funding bill.\n\n“I think there is a deep sense of outrage and betrayal,” Ocasio-Cortez told reporters in Leesburg, Virginia, where House Democrats are huddling for their annual policy retreat. She said she and her fellow Democrats are “texting, calling, sending carrier pigeons,” to mobilize the Democratic base against Schumer’s plan to allow the GOP funding bill to advance.\n\nAnd she slammed Senate Democrats for their decision to “completely roll over and give up on protecting the Constitution.”\n\nAsked whether Senate Democrats need new leadership, Ocasio-Cortez would say only that she is focused on how to prevent her party from accepting the GOP bill.\n\n“We have time to correct course on this decision. Senate Democrats can vote no. We can correct course, and that is the most important thing in front of us right now,” Ocasio-Cortez said.\n\n[…]\n\nPrivately, House Democrats are so infuriated with Schumer’s decision that some have begun encouraging her to run against Schumer in a primary, according to a Democratic member who directly spoke with Ocasio-Cortez about running at the caucus’ policy retreat. Multiple Democrats in the Congressional Progressive Caucus and others directly encouraged Ocasio-Cortez to run on Thursday night after Schumer’s announcement, this member said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI’m not one to defend Democrats or Schumer—if any of these people were drowning politically, I’d either watch or throw them an anvil—but this is how insane the Democrats have become: voting to keep the government open is now viewed as an attack on the Constitution. Schumer, a longtime liberal Democrat, might have had his donkey card ripped up because he’s voting to prevent a shutdown when there is nothing to gain here for his party, which he knows will likely be blamed for the shutdown if Democrats don’t have a message or plan for when the doors are closed. He bluffed and Trump called him on it. He lost. Period.\n\nThe Democrats lost, which I think is why they’re so incensed on the House side—it’s starting to become clear that they cannot beat this man, and they likely never will. One deviation and you’re cleaved from the herd. That’s how they lost in 2024, and why Democrats are in terrible shape among voters.\n\nThis party is lost, which is not to say the Republicans can’t mess up. But they do have some breathing room. Pass this CR and get the budget reconciliation package done. Let the Democrats squabble on how to make themselves more regional and irrelevant.",

        "full_text": "A coalition of House GOP lawmakers is gearing up to introduce legislation preventing Chinese nationals from obtaining U.S. student visas, according to a new report.\n\nOn Wednesday, Fox News revealed that Rep. Riley Moore, R-W.Va., is preparing to file the Stop Chinese Communist Prying by Vindicating Intellectual Safeguards in Academia Act, or the “Stop CCP VISAs Act,” later this week. The legislation, according to the outlet, is intended to block what the congressman contended is Beijing’s “exploitation” of America’s student visa program to undermine U.S. interests.\n\nA copy of the measure obtained by Fox stipulates that, “An alien who is a national of the People’s Republic of China may not be issued a visa or otherwise provided status as a non-immigrant … for the purpose of conducting research or pursuing a course of study.” GOP Reps. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, Andy Ogles of Tennessee, and Brandon Gill of Texas are among those expected to co-sponsor the bill.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials have warned in recent years how the Chinese Communist Party has used America’s student visa program to further its own goals for regional and global dominance.\n\nIn 2019, for instance, the first Trump administration’s Office of the Director of National Intelligence released its “Worldwide Threat Assessment,” which disclosed that “China’s intelligence services will exploit the openness of American society, especially academia and the scientific community, using a variety of means.”\n\nDespite Beijing’s increasingly antagonistic behavior toward America and its allies, however, the U.S. has continued to grant hundreds of thousands of student visas to Chinese nationals every year.\n\nAs The Blaze’s Daniel Horowitz recently reported, “In the 2023-24 academic year, 123,000 Chinese nationals were enrolled in [U.S.] graduate programs, many in sensitive STEM fields.” An additional 62,000, he noted, “participated in ‘optional practical training,’ allowing them to work in those fields while still on student visas.”\n\n“Beyond student visas, the U.S. grants over 20,000 H-1B visas to Chinese nationals each year, along with more than 12,000 J-1 visas for scholars and tens of thousands of additional work visas,” Horowitz wrote. “Over the past 30 years, the U.S. has issued nearly 2 million green cards to Chinese nationals — more than any country except Mexico — despite clear evidence of China’s long-running campaign of economic and academic subversion.”\n\nSpeaking with Fox, Moore cited an October 2024 FBI indictment involving five Chinese nationals who were charged for allegedly spying on a U.S. military base in Northern Michigan. According to Campus Reform, the five individuals — who had recently graduated from the University of Michigan — were purportedly taking photos of military equipment during an August 2023 training exercise between U.S. National Guard forces and Taiwanese military personnel.\n\n“We’ve literally invited the CCP to spy on our military, steal our intellectual property, and threaten national security,” Moore said. “It’s time we turn off the spigot and immediately ban all student visas going to Chinese nationals.”\n\nShawn Fleetwood is a staff writer for The Federalist and a graduate of the University of Mary Washington.

        "full_text": "The Columbine killers have claimed another victim.\n\nNearly 26 years after two troubled Colorado teenagers barged into Columbine High School and opened fire, killing a dozen classmates and a teacher, one of the students left wounded by their barrage of bullets has died from the injuries she sustained on that April 20, 1999, the Jefferson County Coroner's Office reported.\n\nAnne Marie Hochhalter, 43, died of sepsis on Feb. 16 and the two gunshot wounds that left her paralyzed were a \"significant contributing factor\" in her death, Dr. Dawn B. Holmes, a forensic pathologist, wrote in a 13-page report released March 1.\n\n“The manner of death is best classified as homicide,” Holmes wrote.\n\nWith Hochhalter's passing, the death toll now stands at 14. That total does not include the shooters, Dylan Klebold, 17, and Eric Harris, 18, who killed themselves before police could arrest them.\n\nHochhalter, then a 17-year-old junior, was eating lunch with friends when she was shot in the chest and back, suffering wounds that left her paralyzed from the waist down and in chronic pain for the rest of her life.\n\nSix months later, Hochhalter suffered another loss from which she never completely recovered when her mother, Carla June Hochhalter, who had been struggling with depression, walked into a pawnshop and killed herself with a loaded gun that she had been inspecting.\n\nLeaning on her faith and on friendships forged in the wake of Columbine, Hochhalter devoted her life to supporting other victims of mass shootings.\n\n“She was fiercely independent,” Sue Townsend, stepmother of Columbine shooting victim Lauren Townsend told The Denver Post last month. “She was a fighter. She’d get knocked down — she struggled a lot with health issues that stemmed from the shooting — but I’d watch her pull herself back up. She was her best advocate and an advocate for others who weren’t as strong in the disability community.”\n\nIn 2016, Hochhalter found it in her heart to reach out with forgiveness to Klebold's mother, Sue Klebold, after she published a memoir about raising a mass killer called \"A Mother's Reckoning.\"\n\n“Just as I wouldn’t want to be judged by the sins of my family members, I hold you in that same regard,” Hochhalter wrote. “It’s been a rough road for me, with many medical issues because of my spinal cord injury and intense nerve pain, but I choose not to be bitter towards you.\"\n\nThe mass killing at Columbine put a previously obscure Denver suburb called Littleton on the nation's radar, and images of heavily armed SWAT teams descending on the school and the sight of students filing out with their hands up were burned into the national consciousness.\n\n“Columbine played out on TV,” Bruce Beck, who was Lauren Townsend's stepfather, told NBC News in 2019 on the 20th anniversary of the massacre. “No previous school shooting had done that. There was the unknown of where the shooters were during the entire time that it was being filmed, so I think people connected with Columbine more.”\n\nThe others killed at Columbine that day were teacher William \"Dave\" Sanders, 47, and students Cassie Bernall, 17, Steve Curnow, 14, Corey DePooter, 17, Kelly Fleming, 16, Matt Kechter, 16, Daniel Mauser, 15, Daniel Rohrbough, 15, Rachel Scott, 17, Isaiah Shoels, 18, John Tomlin, 16, and Kyle Velasquez, 16.\n\nSadly, the Columbine massacre also set a tragic template for the school shootings that followed.",

The state’s general fund is covering $8.4 billion.\n\nStarting January 1, 2024, California began offering medical coverage to all undocumented immigrants in the state through Medi-Cal, the state’s version of Medicaid, the federal program that covers low-income individuals.\n\nA spokesperson for Gov. Gavin Newsom, D, said of the shortfall “This isn’t new. Rising Medicaid costs are a national challenge, affecting both red and blue states alike. This is not unique to California.”\n\nDuring a budget hearing in February, State Rep. Carl DeMaio, R, said cutting the program would lead to a $1 billion surplus and allow the state to have a reserve.\n\nDeMaio: “My colleague from Los Angeles mentions a moral budget, a morally balanced budget. I’d like to start with a balanced budget.”\n\nAccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 14 states plus DC offer state-funded health care to all children regardless of immigration status, seven of those states and DC also offer coverage to some or all adults.",

        "full_text": "Last week, Blaze News and \"Glenn TV\" exposed a National Aeronautics and Space Administration playbook created to market its Artemis program, a series of missions paving the way to Mars and beyond.\n\nArtemis, which kicked off under the first Trump administration, initially aimed to \"land the first woman and next man\" on the moon. Under the Biden administration, the mission was updated, with NASA vowing to \"land the first woman and first person of color on the Moon.\"\n\n'Let science lead the way.'\n\nA 2021 99-slide deck, \"The Artemis Brand Playbook,\" obtained by Blaze News through whistleblowers, outlined a comprehensive, high-budget marketing strategy for the mission, covering branding, messaging, target audiences, potential challenges, and proposed corporate partnerships.\n\nThe leaked document, detailing storylines for NASA's mission with listed \"antagonists\" and \"protagonists,\" revealed the deep integration of diversity, equity, and inclusion goals under the Biden administration.\n\nTwo NASA whistleblowers, who asked to remain anonymous due to fear of retaliation, previously spoke to Blaze News about the Artemis playbook and the infiltration of DEI at NASA.\n\n\"I was just pretty shocked at how meticulous they were in controlling the narrative and already pre-identifying protagonists, antagonists,\" one of the scientists stated.\n\nShe highlighted the playbook's suggested storylines for the Artemis project, explaining how NASA had \"cherry-pick[ed] these rags-to-riches stories ... a lot of it was centered around DEI.\"\n\nThe second scientist noted the \"production value\" of the extensive slide deck.\n\n\"There's probably millions of dollars attached to this document,\" he told Blaze News.\n\n\"NASA, in my opinion, has become a glorified DEI program,\" he remarked.\n\nA NASA spokesperson confirmed the playbook's authenticity, telling Blaze News that it was \"developed in 2021 by a third party, which had limited use at the agency and reflected the priorities of the previous administration.\"\n\nOn day one of President Donald Trump's second administration, he signed an executive action directing the federal government to purge all DEI-related initiatives. However, NASA did not appear to have updated its website to comply with the order.\n\nFor example, a webpage about the Artemis program noted that the agency still aimed to \"land the first woman, first person of color, and first international partner astronaut on the Moon using innovative technologies to explore more of the lunar surface than ever before.\"\n\nLast week, \"Glenn TV\" contacted the Office of Management and Budget to inquire about NASA's apparent lack of compliance with the Trump administration's requirements.\n\n\"The language from the website has been changed,\" an OMB spokesperson responded. \"Other changes should be end of day.\"\n\nBlaze News confirmed that the language was removed from the webpage.\n\nA learning resources page, titled \"What Is the Artemis Program? (Grades 5-8),\" was also flagged by \"Glenn TV.\" The Trump administration's OMB stated that it plans to update this webpage as well, which as of Wednesday morning still described the mission as \"sending the first woman and first person of color on the Moon.\"\n\nThe whistleblowers shared their reactions to the updates in a statement to Blaze News.\n\nNASA's swift response is a step in the right direction, but the true measure of progress will be whether it leads to real, lasting change. Time and again, we have seen how public messaging diverges from internal reality — leadership makes inspiring commitments in speeches, only for them to be diluted in execution.\n\nThe issue at NASA runs far deeper than just the playbook. DEI sits atop a long list of budgetary burdens that have historically come at the expense of other critical priorities, including the very scientists who drive NASA's missions forward.\n\nScientific achievement should speak for itself — it does not need bureaucracy or public relations teams to temper its message in the name of a politicized agenda. The groundbreaking work of NASA's scientists, engineers, and astronauts is already challenging enough, yet it is too often burdened by unnecessary delays and funding withdrawals. If their work is deemed essential, they must be given the resources and agency to carry it out without interference.\n\nAnything less — especially any reprioritization that shifts focus to DEI at the expense of critical research — is a slap in the face to those scientific efforts.\n\nThe real question is whether this administration will prioritize the people who make space exploration possible. True progress comes from discovery, not from reshuffling priorities to satisfy political narratives.\n\nLet science lead the way. Let the scientists, engineers, and astronauts speak for themselves, let them shape their own stories of success, and let them do so free from unnecessary obstacles and agendas.",

        "full_text": "LOADINGERROR LOADING\n\nThe temporary leader of the Social Security Administration should resign for “outrageous” political retaliation against the state of Maine, Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) said Wednesday.\n\nEarlier this month, the Social Security Administration canceled contracts with Maine’s health department that had allowed parents to request Social Security numbers for newborns at the hospital, which is how 99% of newborns get their numbers in the U.S.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe contracts were quickly reinstated amid suspicion they’d been terminated as payback for Maine Gov. Janet Mills (D) standing up to President Donald Trump in a White House meeting in February.\n\nThis week, Leland Dudek, the acting commissioner of Social Security, acknowledged he was “upset” with Mills for defying the president.\n\n“We’ve now learned that the acting head of the SSA did, in fact, punish our state for daring to question the President. This is absolutely outrageous,” Pingree said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I believe Secretary Dudek should resign immediately ― or be removed from his position,” Pingree said. “The SSA is simply too important, and affects the lives of too many people, for it to be led by someone who is willing to throw an entire state into turmoil, all because its Governor refused to be intimidated by the actions of a President who is acting illegally.”\n\nThe Social Security Administration and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDudek told HuffPost during a press call on Tuesday evening that he canceled the contracts by mistake because he didn’t understand them, but also that he didn’t like how Mills behaved in the February meeting when she told Trump she would “see you in court” over his efforts to force states to disallow transgender athletes from participating in girls’ sports.\n\n“I think when you bring people together to have a cordial exchange, to show governments working together, you need to be respectful of each other,” Dudek said.\n\nDudek denied it was political retaliation, but offered no other reason for the contract cancellations, which also affected electronic death records. Every state has similar contracts; no other state saw theirs canceled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSen. Angus King (I-Maine) previously said the episode “left many unanswered questions about the Social Security Administration’s motivations,” but neither he nor other members of the Maine congressional delegation responded to requests for comment on Wednesday. Nor did the Republican chairs of the House and Senate committees that oversee Social Security.\n\nRep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement that Dudek “admitted to canceling contracts out of pettiness” and is running Social Security into the ground at the direction of Trump and Elon Musk, the senior White House adviser in charge of downsizing federal agencies.\n\nTrump tapped Dudek for acting commissioner last month after his predecessor in the role refused to grant Musk’s team access to sensitive Social Security databases. The Senate Finance Committee is set to hold a hearing with Frank Bisignano, the man Trump picked to succeed Dudek, next week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDudek has drawn up plans for layoffs, consolidated internal bureaucracies and announced changes to customer service that will require more seniors to visit Social Security offices in person.\n\n“I’ve had to make some tough choices, choices I didn’t agree with, but the president wanted it and I did it,” Dudek said in a closed-door meeting earlier this month, according to a recording obtained by ProPublica. It’s not clear what choices Dudek had in mind but it’s possible he was talking about Maine’s “enumeration at birth” and “electronic death records” contracts.\n\nGo Ad-Free — And Protect The Free Press\n\nThe next four years will change America forever.

        "full_text": "Democrats are relying on a recent memo from the Government Accountability Office to argue that President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans can't pass a bill repealing a Biden-era waiver allowing California to mandate electric vehicles in the state. But legal experts say the memo—whose authors include a prominent DEI activist—isn't legally binding and relies on dubious reasoning.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office—which conducts audits and analyses for Congress but has minimal legislative authority—published the memo earlier this month just two weeks after Democratic senators Adam Schiff (Calif.), Alex Padilla (Calif.), and Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.) asked it to investigate the issue. Media outlets then reported that the memo determined a bill to reverse the Biden-era action is \"illegal\" and that the office, therefore, \"blocks\" such a bill.\n\nThe office's memo presents a potential roadblock to Trump's energy agenda, a key tenet of which involves revoking electric vehicle mandates. Democrats, who cheered the opinion immediately after it was published, may request that the Senate parliamentarian weigh in on the issue and consult the Government Accountability Office's opinion.\n\nIf Democrats are successful in using the opinion to block the bill, the California electric vehicle mandate can only be overturned through a formal Environmental Protection Agency rulemaking process that would take years to complete and likely attract legal challenges.\n\nBut experts say there are key legal deficiencies in the Government Accountability Office's opinion. \"It's just sloppy work,\" Michael Buschbacher, a former counsel at the Department of Justice's Environment and Natural Resources Division, told the Washington Free Beacon. \"I think the goal of what they were doing was to insert themselves in this process.\"\n\nAnd the quick turnaround on the document raises questions about the level of involvement from the Democratic lawmakers who requested the opinion—the office usually takes months to complete analyses, not a couple of weeks.\n\nNotably, one of the coauthors of the Government Accountability Office's memo is Shirley Jones, the office's managing associate general counsel. Jones is an outspoken DEI activist who recently served as the president of the advocacy group Blacks in Government, once applauded former president Joe Biden's executive order on DEI in the federal workforce, and said in a 2021 interview that women who work in the government face \"microaggressions\" and are often subjected to \"mansplaining.\"\n\nIn December, in one of its final actions during the Biden administration, the Environmental Protection Agency granted California a waiver under the 1970 Clean Air Act that allows it to issue vehicle emissions regulations that are stricter than federal emissions standards, an action that green-lit the state's electric vehicle mandate that will kick in later this year. The waiver allows other states to adopt California's rules, something 12 states have opted to do.\n\nAccording to the Government Accountability Office's memo authored by Jones, the Biden administration's action is not subject to a Congressional Review Act resolution because it is a waiver, not a rule or regulation. The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to pass resolutions via a simple majority floor vote to reverse actions finalized by federal agencies.\n\nA successful Congressional Review Act resolution would immediately overturn the Biden-era waiver and California mandate, meaning the Trump EPA wouldn't have to overturn it through a formal rulemaking process, which could take years and attract legal challenges.\n\nSuch a resolution is the Trump administration's preferred course of action—in February, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin submitted the waiver to Congress for review. One month earlier, Rep. John Joyce (R., Pa.) introduced the Preserving Choice in Vehicle Purchases Act, a Congressional Review Act resolution that would overturn the waiver and is poised to receive a floor vote in the near future.\n\nBuschbacher, the former Justice Department official, noted that the Government Accountability Office's opinion fails even to acknowledge Section 177 of the Clean Air Act, the provision that allows other states to adopt California's standards. That, according to Buschbacher, makes an EPA waiver a \"rule of general applicability\" since it has far-reaching nationwide impacts, a bar that it must clear to be considered a \"rule\" under the Congressional Review Act.\n\nBuschbacher and Jimmy Conde, who are both partners at the law firm Boyden Gray, wrote a paper this month that argued in favor of Congress's authority to use the Congressional Review Act to overturn EPA waivers. The paper states that the Government Accountability Office, an unelected part of the federal bureaucracy, does not have the authority to restrict Congress from making law, that it is longstanding precedent that all actions an agency submits to Congress are treated as rules, and that EPA waivers have nationwide impacts.\n\n\"What GAO has previously said is that submission of a rule or an action to Congress—any action to Congress, even when the agency thinks it's not a rule and submits it only out of an abundance of caution—gets treated as a rule,\" Buschbacher said in reference to the Government Accountability Office's past opinions.\n\nUltimately, Buschbacher said the memo should have little impact on Congress's ability to pass a bill overturning the waiver green-lighting California's mandate—\"it's like they wrote an op-ed basically,\" he told the Free Beacon.\n\nThe Senate parliamentarian has no formal role in the process but has historically advised Congress based on the Government Accountability Office's opinions. Since the EPA hasn't overturned its prior positions, that should not pose an obstacle, Buschbacher said. If the parliamentarian were to conclude otherwise, however, \"that would essentially change the rules in the middle of the game and put things into uncharted territory.\"\n\n\"The plain text of the [Congressional Review Act] is very clear that once an agency action is submitted to Congress for review, Congress has the unreviewable power to consider and, if desired, disapprove of that action,\" said Kenny Stein, the vice president of policy at the American Energy Alliance. \"There is no provision in the [Congressional Review Act] that GAO must first signal approval prior to Congress acting under the [Congressional Review Act].\"\n\nMike McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist who worked in the White House during the first Trump administration, said he gave the Government Accountability Office an \"A-minus for creativity. D for execution.\"\n\n\"It's like they're trying to confirm the idea that the deep state is a legit threat,\" he told the Free Beacon.\n\n\"You have clear agreement between the executive branch and legislative branch,\" an energy industry source told the Free Beacon. \"That's sort of the deep state, the blatantly political angle that you have here. Three Democratic senators said, 'Hey, GAO, what do you think, even though you don't have a role to play?' And lo and behold, they miraculously had a pre-baked 10-page memo.\"",

        "full_text": "U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent foreign-policy moves have alienated the country’s traditional allies in Europe while stirring glee in Moscow. While it’s a catastrophic development for Ukrainian security and democracy, this paradigmatic shift portends much larger risks for global security. The most pressing is the threat of rampant nuclear proliferation that the Trump administration’s actions will elicit.\n\nWhile on the surface it might seem as though a warmer relationship between two of the world’s largest nuclear powers could reduce the risk of nuclear war, the opposite is true. We are on the precipice of a global turn toward nuclear instability, in which many countries will be newly incentivized to build their own arsenals, increasing the risk of nuclear use, terrorist subversion, and accidental launch. Countries like South Korea, Japan, Iran, and Saudi Arabia are all so-called nuclear latent states that could potentially build nuclear weapons quickly—as are Germany, Belgium, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands.\n\nFor the last eight decades, the United States has served as a security guarantor to many countries in both Europe and Asia. Trump insists that Washington has received the short end of the stick from these arrangements, since it was the U.S. nuclear arsenal that served as the ultimate deterrent in defense of the United States’ allies. The massive upside of U.S. security guarantees, however, including for Americans, has been the astonishing containment of nuclear proliferation elsewhere.\n\nOnly nine countries around the world have nuclear weapons today: the United States, Russia, United Kingdom, France, China, Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea. (South Africa gave up its nuclear weapons and then signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1991.) Today, 190 countries are parties to the treaty, which went into effect in 1970. The only non-signatory states are India, Israel, Pakistan, and South Sudan. (North Korea withdrew from the treaty in 2003 to pursue its nuclear weapons program.)\n\nMany countries signed the NPT because of U.S. assurances about their security—what is commonly known as the nuclear umbrella. These countries include NATO members in Europe (such as Germany, Italy, and Belgium), along with other U.S. allies like Japan and South Korea. When Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus inherited a large number of nuclear weapons and delivery systems in the early 1990s after the Soviet Union collapsed, U.S. security assurances helped convince them to give up their nuclear weapons.\n\nThe confinement of this deadly technology to relatively few countries has been a massive boon to global security and allowed for much greater prosperity. Without U.S. security assurances, the world might have been far more insecure, with several additional nuclear weapons states across Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Nuclear safety and inadvertent escalation concerns about the possession of nuclear weapons mean that we might even have seen potential nuclear use—deliberate or accidental—which would have had catastrophic consequences.\n\nU.S. security guarantees, long perceived as highly credible, have been a pillar of the global nonproliferation regime that has reduced the likelihood of nuclear war and nuclear accidents, and allowed countries to devote resources to other purposes—including economic prosperity.\n\nThe credibility of the U.S. nuclear umbrella has now been shattered by Trump. Why would NATO allies in Europe—recent targets of intense criticism by the Trump administration—believe that the United States would stand by them in the case of a nuclear threat from Russia?\n\nAmong U.S. allies threatened by China or North Korea’s nuclear weapons, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea are undoubtedly asking themselves this same question. The broader concern here is that even if just one of these European or East Asian allies decides to secure themselves by building their own nuclear weapons, there might be a domino effect leading to several more nuclear states. This would sound the death knell of the nuclear nonproliferation regime.\n\nThere may be higher risks of nuclear proliferation in Asia than in Europe because both France and the U.K. have nuclear arsenals that could provide extended deterrence to NATO. Even in Europe, however, political conditions are concerning. The parties garnering the second-most popular support today in France, Germany, and Poland are all right-wing nationalists. Marine Le Pen, who could potentially become the next French president, recently said that France should not share the country’s nuclear weapons, “let alone delegate” their use to other European countries.\n\nThere have also been calls for Germany to recommit to civilian nuclear research, with the aim of developing its ability to build nuclear weapons. Poland is also considering its nuclear options. The stability of the erstwhile European security architecture that used to be upheld by the promise of U.S. nuclear assurances is now rapidly fraying and giving way to a path of nuclear proliferation on the continent.\n\nSome scholars have argued that more nuclear weapons around the world would actually enhance security. They cite the absence of nuclear use between the United States and Soviet Union over the course of the Cold War, inferring that because the consequences of nuclear use are so dire, states are almost never willing to take that risk.\n\nAccording to this reasoning, we don’t need to fear nuclear proliferation because that will not necessarily increase the risk of use. This school of thought argues further that nuclear proliferation could even reduce the incidence of conventional war since the dangers of nuclear escalation would always lurk in the background.\n\nUnwittingly encouraging widespread nuclear proliferation is a highly reckless move, however. The introduction of nuclear programs is known to create fear, distrust, and competition—even among allies. France’s development of nuclear weapons in 1960 led to an acrimonious relationship with the United States that prompted Paris to withdraw from NATO’s integrated military command in 1966. China’s development of nuclear weapons in 1964 also hastened its split from the Soviet Union in the 1960s, eventually leading to a nuclear crisis by the end of the decade.\n\nSecurity dilemmas would replace alliances. The risks of accidental launch exponentially increase if more countries possess nuclear weapons. Not every state has the resources to maintain safe and secure nuclear arsenals, raising huge concerns about command, control, and vulnerability to terrorist sabotage or theft. For example, in Pakistan, terrorists have attacked a nuclear missile storage facility, a nuclear airbase, and one of the country’s main nuclear weapon assembly sites.\n\nAlthough countries that perceive themselves as thoroughly ensconced within the U.S.-led security order might be the first to proliferate, they most certainly would not be the last. A range of regimes would be tempted to secure their futures with nuclear weapons, and the end result would be that everyone is significantly less secure.\n\nIt is well past time for the Trump administration to think strategically about U.S. interests, as well as of those around the world who have long benefited from the relative stability of U.S. security guarantees. If the United States continues to sow serious doubt about the credibility of its security commitments, however, regional organizations in Europe and the Indo-Pacific must step into the breach to create sustainable multilateral security frameworks. It is also important for potential proliferator states to consider that acquiring nuclear weapons may not make them any safer.\n\nEven beyond the potential nuclear accidents and inadvertent escalation concerns, possessing nuclear weapons does not necessarily lead to a more stable or peaceful security environment. The experience of India and Pakistan demonstrates that conventional wars, military action, and sub-conventional attacks can still take place between nuclear-armed neighbors. This would be true of a nuclear Poland against Russia and a nuclear South Korea against North Korea, for example.\n\nThe Trump administration’s actions have stoked great insecurity across the globe. As a result, the world is a much more dangerous place than it was just a few weeks ago.",

        "full_text": "SEATTLE (AP) — Cybertrucks set ablaze. Bullets and Molotov cocktails aimed at Tesla showrooms.\n\nAttacks on property carrying the logo of Elon Musk’s electric-car company are cropping up across the U.S. and overseas. While no injuries have been reported, Tesla showrooms, vehicle lots, charging stations and privately owned cars have been targeted.\n\nThere’s been a clear uptick since President Donald Trump took office and empowered Musk to oversee a new Department of Government Efficiency that’s slashing government spending. Experts on domestic extremism say it’s impossible to know yet if the spate of incidents will balloon into a long-term pattern.\n\nIn Trump’s first term, his properties in New York, Washington and elsewhere became a natural place for protest. In the early days of his second term, Tesla is filling that role.\n\n“Tesla is an easy target,” said Randy Blazak, a sociologist who studies political violence. “They’re rolling down our streets. They have dealerships in our neighborhoods.”\n\nMusk critics have organized dozens of peaceful demonstrations at Tesla dealerships and factories across North America and Europe. Some Tesla owners, including a U.S. senator who feuded with Musk, have vowed to sell their vehicles.\n\nBut the attacks are keeping law enforcement busy.\n\nProsecutors in Colorado charged a woman last month in connection with attacks on Tesla dealerships, including Molotov cocktails thrown at vehicles and the words “Nazi cars” spray-painted on a building.\n\nAnd federal agents in South Carolina last week arrested a man they say set fire to Tesla charging stations near Charleston. An agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives wrote in an affidavit that authorities found writings critical of the government and DOGE in his bedroom and wallet.\n\n“The statement made mention of sending a message based on these beliefs,” the agent wrote.\n\nSome of the most prominent incidents have been reported in left-leaning cities in the Pacific Northwest, like Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, where anti-Trump and anti-Musk sentiment runs high.\n\nAn Oregon man faces charges after allegedly throwing several Molotov cocktails at a Tesla store in Salem, then returning another day and shooting out windows. In the Portland suburb of Tigard, more than a dozen bullets were fired at a Tesla showroom last week, damaging vehicles and windows, the second time in a week that the store was targeted.\n\nFour Cybertrucks were set on fire in a Tesla lot in Seattle earlier this month. On Friday, witnesses reported a man poured gasoline on an unoccupied Tesla Model S and started a fire on a Seattle street.\n\nIn Las Vegas, several Tesla vehicles were set ablaze early Tuesday outside a Tesla service center where the word “resist” was also painted in red across the building’s front doors. Authorities said at least one person threw Molotov cocktails — crude bombs filled with gasoline or another flammable liquid — and fired several rounds from a weapon into the vehicles.\n\n“Was this terrorism? Was it something else? It certainly has some of the hallmarks that we might think — the writing on the wall, potential political agenda, an act of violence,” Spencer Evans, the special agent in charge of the Las Vegas FBI office, said at a news conference. “None of those factors are lost on us.”\n\nTesla becomes a target for the left\n\nTesla was once the darling of the left. Helped to viability by a $465 million federal loan during the Obama administration, the company popularized electric vehicles and proved, despite their early reputation, that they didn’t have to be small, stodgy, underpowered and limited in range.\n\nMore recently, though, Musk has allied himself with the right. He bought the social network Twitter, renamed it X and erased restrictions that had infuriated conservatives. He spent an estimated $250 million to boost Trump’s 2024 Republican campaign, becoming by far his biggest benefactor.\n\nMusk continues to run Tesla — as well as X and the rocket manufacturer SpaceX — while also serving as Trump’s adviser.\n\nTesla stock doubled in value in the weeks after Trump’s election but has since shed all those gains.\n\nTrump gave a boost to the company when he turned the White House driveway into an electric-vehicle showroom. He promoted the vehicles and said he would purchase an $80,000 Model S, eschewing his fierce past criticism of electric vehicles.\n\nTesla didn’t respond to a request for comment. Musk briefly addressed the vandalism Monday during an appearance on Sen. Ted Cruz’s podcast, saying “at least some of it is organized and paid for” by “left-wing organizations in America, funded by left-wing billionaires, essentially.”\n\n“This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,” Musk wrote Tuesday on X, sharing a video of burning Teslas in Las Vegas. “Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.”\n\nThe progressive group Indivisible, which published a guide for supporters to organize “Musk Or Us” protests around the country, said in a statement that all of its guidance is publicly available and “it explicitly encourages peaceful protest and condemns any acts of violence or vandalism.”\n\nSome Tesla owners have resorted to cheeky bumper stickers to distance themselves from their vehicle’s new stigma and perhaps deter would-be vandals. They say things like “I bought this before we knew Elon was crazy” or “I just wanted an electric car. Sorry guys.”\n\nPrices for used Cybertrucks, Tesla’s most distinctive product, have dropped nearly 8% since Trump took office, according to CarGurus, which aggregates used-car vehicle listings. The market as a whole remained steady over the period.\n\nThe White House vows a crackdown\n\nThe White House has thrown its weight behind Musk, the highest-profile member of Trump’s administration and a key donor to committees promoting Trump’s political interests. Trump has said Tesla vandalism amounts to “domestic terror,” and Trump has threatened retribution, warning that those who target the company are “going to go through hell.”\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi said she’d opened an investigation “to see how is this being funded, who is behind this.”\n\n“If you’re going to touch a Tesla, go to a dealership, do anything, you better watch out because we’re coming after you,” Bondi said Friday on Fox Business Network. In a statement Tuesday, she vowed to “continue investigations that impose severe consequences,” including for “those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes.”\n\nColin Clarke, a senior research fellow at the Soufan Center, said left-wing political violence tends to target property rather than people. He views the rise of neo-Nazi groups as a bigger security threat at this point.\n\n“It’s not the type of act that I would prioritize,” Clarke said. “Not right now compared to all the other threats that are out there.”\n\nTheresa Ramsdell is the president of the Tesla Owners of Washington state, a club for Tesla enthusiasts, and she and her husband own three of them.\n\n“Hate on Elon and Trump all you want — that’s fine and dandy, it’s your choice,” she said. “It doesn’t justify ruining somebody’s property, vandalizing it, destroying it, setting it on fire. There’s other ways to get your voice heard that’s more effective.”\n\nSomeone recently slapped a “no Elon” sticker on the tailgate of her Cybertruck, but she said she doesn’t intend to stop driving her Teslas. Other club members have taken a similar view, she said.\n\n“I love my car. It’s the safest car,” Ramsdell said. “I’m not going to let somebody else judge me for the car I drive.”\n\n___\n\nCooper reported from Phoenix.",

        "full_text": "The US is expelling South Africa's ambassador to Washington, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio describing him as a \"race-baiting politician\".\n\nIn a post on X, Rubio accused Ebrahim Rasool of hating the US and President Donald Trump, and said the ambassador was \"no longer welcome in our great country\".\n\nThe office for South Africa's president on Saturday called the decision \"regrettable\", adding that the country remained committed to building a mutually beneficial relationship with the US.\n\nThe rare move by the US marks the latest development in rising tensions between the two countries.\n\nWhile lower-ranking diplomats are sometimes expelled, it's highly unusual in the US for it to happen to a more senior official.\n\nIn his post on Friday, Rubio linked to an article from the right-wing outlet Breitbart that quoted some of Rasool's recent remarks made during an online lecture about the Trump administration.\n\nAt the event, Rasool said Trump was \"mobilising a supremacism\" and trying to \"project white victimhood as a dog whistle\" as the white population faced becoming a minority in the US.\n\n\"We see it in the domestic politics of the USA, the Maga movement as a response not simply to a supremacist instinct, but to very clear data that shows great demographic shifts in the USA in which the voting electorate in the USA is projected to become 48% white,\" he said.\n\nHe suggested that South Africa was under attack because \"we are the historical antidote to supremacism\".\n\nIn response, Rubio called Rasool \"PERSONA NON GRATA\", referencing the Latin phrase for \"unwelcome person\".\n\nTies between the US and South Africa have been deteriorating since Trump took office.\n\nAn executive order last month - which froze US assistance to South Africa - cited \"unjust racial discrimination\" against white Afrikaners, largely descended from Dutch settlers who first arrived in the 17th Century.\n\nIt references a new law, the Expropriation Act, that it claims targets Afrikaners by allowing the government to take away private land.\n\n\"As long as South Africa continues to support bad actors on the world stage and allows violent attacks on innocent disfavoured minority farmers, the United States will stop aid and assistance to the country,\" a statement from the White House said at the time.\n\nSouth Africa's 2022 census noted that white people - including Afrikaners - made up 7.2% of the population. However, according to a 2018 land audit by the South African government, white farmers owned 72% of the country's individually-held farmland.\n\nSouth Africa's government, which is made up of 10 parties led by the African National Congress (ANC), said earlier that the US president's actions were based on \"a campaign of misinformation and propaganda aimed at misrepresenting our great nation\".\n\nIt added no land had been seized without compensation and said this would only happen in exceptional circumstances, such as if land was needed for public use and all other avenues to acquire the land had been exhausted.\n\nA fact sheet from the White House states the country \"blatantly discriminates against ethnic minority descendants of settler groups\".\n\nRasool - who previously served as US ambassador from 2010 to 2015 - was himself forcibly removed from his home in Cape Town's District Six as a child after it was declared a white area under the Apartheid government.\n\nHe would later describe the eviction as a significant moment in his upbringing which guided his future.\n\nRasool became Pretoria's ambassador to the US again in 2024.\n\nUnnamed sources in the South African government told online news site Daily Maverick at the time that he was thought to be well placed to deal with a Trump administration because of the experience and contacts he had acquired during his first stint as ambassador.",

        "full_text": "A French politician has called on the US to give the Statue of Liberty back after suggesting that some Americans “have chosen to switch to the side of the tyrants.”\n\nRaphael Glucksmann, a member of the European Parliament who represents the small left-wing party Place Publique, made the comments at a rally on Sunday.\n\n“Give us back the Statue of Liberty,” said Glucksmann. “It was our gift to you. But apparently you despise her.”\n\nThe statue was a gift of friendship to America from France. Inaugurated in 1886, it represents Libertas, the Roman liberty goddess, bearing a torch in her right hand and a tablet in her left hand with the date of the US Declaration of Independence.\n\nBroken shackles lie underneath the statue’s drapery, to symbolize the end of all types of servitude and oppression.\n\nOn Monday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt fired back at Glucksmann.\n\n“My advice to that unnamed low-level French politician would be to remind them that it’s only because of the United States of America that the French are not speaking German right now, so they should be very grateful to our great country,” she said.\n\nGlucksmann then responded in a series of posts on X and Instagram.\n\nHe emphasized that his gratitude to the US “heroes” that fought against the Nazis in WWII is “eternal,” before making a contrast with US President Donald Trump’s recent attempts to negotiate a settlement between Russia and Ukraine, as well as Trump’s public spat with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n“The America of these heroes fought against tyrants, it did not flatter them. It was the enemy of fascism, not the friend of Putin. It helped the resistance and didn’t attack Zelensky,” he wrote.\n\n“It is precisely because I am petrified by Trumps (sic) betrayal that I said yesterday in a rally that we could symbolically take back the Statue of Liberty if your government despised everything it symbolizes in your eyes, ours, and those of the world,” said Glucksmann.\n\n“No one, of course, will come and steal the Statue of Liberty. The statue is yours. But what it embodies belongs to everyone,” he said.\n\n“And if the free world no longer interests your government, then we will take up the torch, here in Europe.”\n\nGlucksmann is co-president of the Place Publique party, which currently holds three seats in the European Parliament, as well as one in the French parliament and another in the country’s senate.\n\nDespite his party’s small size, Glucksmann has received an increasing amount of attention in the French media, including an in-depth interview in political magazine Le Nouvel Obs published March 5, in which he underlined the importance that European powers step up their defense spending amid a reorienting of US policy priorities.\n\nIt has also been rumored that Glucksmann is planning to run for president in elections scheduled for early 2027.",

Both Bedoya and Slaughter called their firings “illegal” and vowed to challenge Trump in court.\n\n“The president just illegally fired me.

Mark Meador, who was nominated by Trump to be the third Republican FTC commissioner, has yet to be confirmed by a full Senate vote.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear if Trump plans to nominate replacements for Bedoya and Slaughter.\n\nWhite House assistant press secretary Taylor Rogers said Trump “has the lawful authority to manage personnel within the executive branch.”\n\n“President Trump will continue to rid the federal government of bad actors unaligned with his common sense agenda the American people decisively voted for,” Rogers added in a statement.\n\nFerguson, who has referred to the agency as the “Trump-Vance FTC” since taking over as chair, backed the president’s right to fire commissioners.\n\n“I have no doubts about his constitutional authority to remove commissioners, which is necessary to ensure democratic accountability for our government,” Ferguson said in a statement posted on X.\n\n“The Federal Trade Commission will continue its tireless work to protect consumers, lower prices, and police anticompetitive behavior,” Ferguson added.\n\nA White House official informed Bedoya and Slaughter that the president has “unrestricted power” to remove executive-branch officers who were confirmed by the Senate, according to an email obtained by the Wall Street Journal.\n\n“Your continued service on the FTC is inconsistent with my administration’s priorities,” the email said. “Accordingly, I am removing you from office pursuant to my authority under Article II of the Constitution.”\n\nEarlier this week, Ferguson confirmed that the FTC was fully prepared to challenge Meta in an April trial that is seeking a breakup of the tech giant. The agency also has pending cases against Amazon and oversees data privacy settlements related to Meta and X.\n\nTrump has sought to exert greater control over independent agencies, issuing an executive order in February that gave the White House more latitude.\n\nThe firings will test a 1935 decision by the Supreme Court in the case Humphrey’s Executor v. United States.\n\nAt the time, the court ruled that the president doesn’t have the authority to fire FTC commissioners without good cause — setting a precedent that has traditionally shielded independent bodies like the FTC and the Federal Reserve from direct executive intervention.\n\nThe White House argues that the FTC has significant executive power and that exemptions offered by Humphrey’s Executor should not apply to its commissioners.\n\nThe FTC firings have “major implications for the independence of the Fed,” one former FTC official told The Post.\n\nTrump has been sharply critical of Fed Chair Jerome Powell in the past due to disagreements over his handling of interest rates. Powell will notably announce the Fed’s next policy move this afternoon.\n\n“I think it was timed as a threat,” the FTC official said.\n\nThe firings along partisan lines could backfire on Republicans in the future under a Democratic White House administration, the official added.\n\n“Are we all going to be happy with Queen Lina Khan at the FTC?” the official said.\n\nKhan, who led the agency under former President Joe Biden and irritated business leaders with a hardnosed approach to enforcement, also ripped the firings.\n\n“The @FTC must enforce the law without fear or favor,” Khan said. “The administration’s illegal attempt to fire Commissioners Slaughter & Bedoya is a disturbing sign that this FTC won’t. It’s a gift to corporate lawbreakers that squeeze American consumers, workers, and honest businesses.”",

        "full_text": "In the wake of the crises of the decade so far — the pandemic, extreme weather and natural disasters, among others — Americans have increasingly expressed their doubts about institutions, the government especially.\n\nSince Donald Trump’s return to office and the rise of Elon Musk as a major political figure, there’s been intense focus on a simple set of questions: What should the government be for? Who should it help? What explains its failures? In Opinion’s latest focus group, we spoke with 14 people from North Carolina who were either directly affected last year by Hurricane Helene, or who had close friends or family members who were. Because of that event, many of them were directly confronted with these questions of government help and trust in institutions. At a time when the future of many government services could change significantly, we asked them about what Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk are doing and how other leaders, like Joe Biden, handled the crisis.\n\n“The whole system of fixing things is broken. Everything that’s supposed to be in place is not there,” one participant said, describing his worries about not only North Carolina but also places devastated by wildfires in recent years. Some worried about FEMA’s future, even if they were deeply dissatisfied with the recovery efforts last year, others wanted to rethink it entirely, and others expressed frustration with the lack of understanding in this hyperpoliticized environment and the false claims that circulated last fall.\n\nAnd at a time when people — including participants in this group — expressed real concern and worry about government cuts, layoffs and funding changes, many also expressed a skeptical and dissatisfied view of how government performs today. What does government do well? One participant answered, “Provide complicated explanations for why it does what it does.”\n\nI want to start off with a really big question: What is government for?\n\nGovernment has a lot of functions. It’s making sure that we have a functioning society and not chaos. It’s the military. It’s public services and programs like Social Security and Medicaid. It’s helping its citizens.\n\nMaintaining order, security, protecting our rights, having some sort of rules and structure around everything — that’s my immediate thought when I think about what the government is supposed to do.\n\nYeah, the government is supposed to provide law and guidance to people so that we all have the same rights and responsibilities.\n\nLet’s talk a bit about the federal government. What does the federal government do well?\n\nFund its military.\n\nCollect taxes. That’s not a good thing.\n\nProvide complicated explanations for why it does what it does.\n\nNot all the people they’re helping deserve the help, but they do supply help to people who are needy, like vets. I think they could do better.\n\nA great segue into my next question: Who is the federal government good at helping?\n\nRich people.\n\nI think they do take care of businesses, so as to ensure that there’s work and jobs.\n\nWhat about state and local government? What are some things they do well, maybe even better than the federal government?\n\nEverything.\n\nThey are more in tune with what our citizens need, our local citizens. A lot of agencies here in North Carolina are local, and they kind of have an ear to what our local people need.\n\nNorth Carolina is definitely pushing the boundaries of working for itself versus for the people. We’ve seen a lot of legislation passed recently that really doesn’t have the best interest of the people, along with a lot of tactics to try to block votes. So while state governments certainly are more in tune across the board, I think North Carolina is testing the limits of what would have been acceptable in the past.\n\nWhat are some things the federal government doesn’t do so well?\n\nI don’t think the federal government does well with FEMA. I think that they’ve let the people of Western North Carolina down.\n\nThere’s been an attempt at combating rampant misinformation. I see all of these documents and websites that try to help people understand what’s actually happening in government and with FEMA. But it seems to just kind of create more mistrust and misinformation. I don’t really know how to combat that, but I think that we could explore other ways to build confidence in our government than tip sheets and fact sheets.\n\nI think the federal government did a terrible job on the Covid response with their overreach. They threw a lot of businesses, especially restaurants and small business owners, in a big wreck, and they silenced alternative methods of treatments for Covid.\n\nIn Washington there’s a lot of discussion about making some pretty big changes to the federal government, including reducing its size. What have people heard about the changes that have been happening in the federal government?\n\nObviously, I hear about Elon Musk and DOGE and the sledgehammer that they’re taking to a lot of the government agencies. There was a memo about laying off 80,000 workers in the V.A. A lot of those are veterans. So I think there’s definitely waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government that needs to be corrected. But I think we need to use a scalpel, not a sledgehammer. And I think it’s causing a lot of problems in the country.\n\nWe have a shadow president. Elon Musk is running the country, and Trump isn’t. And he is sitting here, tearing apart the country. All these people are being laid off. It’s just a mess. I voted Republican before, so it’s nothing against them. But what they’re doing is totally wrong.\n\nWhat, in particular, do you think is wrong about it?\n\nThat all these people are losing their jobs, veterans. There aren’t any jobs. Cuts to services, U.S.A.I.D. It’s everything. The markets are down. Farmers might lose their farms. It’s just terrible, what’s happening right now.\n\nAll the layoffs are very concerning. We’re losing jobs in the technical aspects like NOAA and the National Weather Service. They recently shut down classes for the National Fire Training Academy because all those jobs and funding were cut. And those are not just somebody pushing a piece of paper somewhere. Those vital jobs that are needed to support the whole country.\n\nI think the cuts are absolutely good. We’ve spent billions of dollars for other countries and crazy programs like transgender research in other countries and all kinds of idiotic, non-common-sense expenditures of taxpayer dollars. And that has to change. It’s been going on for years, government waste on both sides.\n\nI want to switch gears a bit to North Carolina and Hurricane Helene. First, what’s your favorite thing about living in North Carolina?\n\nI love that I am roughly an hour and a half from virtually everything except the beach. There’s a big city relatively close by. I can go up to the mountains and hike. I can go over to nice flatlands. We’ve got really good lakes here.\n\nI similarly love the variety that we have. The mountains are so beautiful, with amazing hikes. We have beautiful beaches and big cities, lakes and a very rich history.\n\nComing from New York — the quality of life here is, hands down, the best. The air smells different. You’re not in a rush to go nowhere like we are in New York. I just love being here. And moving here was the best decision I’ve ever made my whole life.\n\nObviously, a major part of life in Western North Carolina in the last year has been Hurricane Helene. What’s the first thing that comes to mind when I say “Hurricane Helene”?\n\nDevastating.\n\nHorrific.\n\nWrecked.\n\nAbsolute disaster.\n\nDevastating.\n\nYeah, devastating.\n\nDestruction.\n\nWhen I first moved to North Carolina as a kid, it was actually a week before Hurricane Hugo hit. That was a profound experience that I carry with me. Preparedness becomes a focal point with every bad storm because my dad was in construction. Still, with Hurricane Helene, it happened to be that even though they said, “Here’s the worst thing that could happen,” it was still worse.\n\nI lived in Florida for 16 years. So I was prepared, as far as my husband and my immediate needs. But I wasn’t prepared for the road coming up and the waters just doing what they did. I feel like I was as prepared as I could be, though.\n\nPorscha, you said 1. Tell me why you feel you weren’t prepared.\n\nI’m also from New York. I went through Hurricane Sandy. At that time, people seemed to know what was going to happen. The need to evacuate, the danger zone — all that was clear. With Helene, although we watched the news, I don’t think anybody had even a clue that it was going to get that bad. One day, you’re living one way, and the next day, it’s just gone.\n\nWas there a specific moment when you all realized this was a bad storm?\n\nI was out of the country when it was happening. I was keeping up with the news, and no one was texting me back. It would take weeks to reach friends and family. And it was weird because they didn’t know what was happening, given that there was difficulty with transportation and the phones were down. Somehow I was more informed than people who were going through it in real time.\n\nFor me, things got real when our highway and a lot of the major roads were completely blocked. That was a doozy.\n\nWhen the stream in front of my house was coming up to my front door and I was seeing bridges go underwater, I thought, “OK, we’re in trouble.”\n\nI wasn’t personally affected by the hurricane, but my aunt was. When I wasn’t able to get in touch with her and I heard that everybody lost power for weeks on end, I knew that things were really bad. Where I’m from, we got a few downed trees and lost power for a day or two.\n\nWhere do you feel you got the most accurate information about what was happening in the days when the storm was happening and in the immediate aftermath?\n\nIt was really difficult to get accurate information during the storm. But in the aftermath Blue Ridge Public Radio was the best information that I came across. They started sending daily text messages on what they knew, and they continued to do that until we had our water back and clean.\n\nIt’s about the same with us. Our county, they were sending us alerts on our phone. That’s how I got it before the storm.\n\nDid you encounter anything that just didn’t turn out to be true or that was misleading?\n\nThat happens a lot with regular media. They try to jump on the story just to get something on the air. But they don’t have either all the information or enough facts. My two-way radio connected me with a lot of North Carolina, including the VIPER Network, the radio network for the public safety officials across the entire state.\n\nThere was a lot of politicization of the event because it was right before the big election. And there was a lot of blaming. There was a lot of misinformation about who was getting helped, who was not getting help, who was flying helicopters, who wasn’t. So a lot of stories that came out — a lot of things got debunked. A lot of things actually were true to some degree, but there was just a lot of things trying to polarize people instead of bringing us all together.\n\nWe were without internet for the better part of two weeks. And that meant that most people were finding information on their phones, and even then, you still couldn’t get much. So a lot of people were focusing on social media, where they could get little bursts of things. There was a lot of, “Oh, well, I heard someone say this.” Seeing it through that lens pretty consistently, there were things that were getting spread that were very obviously not true. But people were not in a position to fact-check it, and that’s why it was going rampant.\n\nPorscha, I’ll start with you. Why did you give the government a 1?\n\nI have family that was directly affected, and they just expressed to me how terrible it was, especially immediately after, to get help or support or even just an understanding of what’s all going on or when they will get help or when or how or anything. They didn’t feel safe, secure or any of the things that I said government is responsible for.\n\nI also said 1. Locally, I think things went well. In the western part of the state, absolutely not. There are still people living in tents. It’s not right. I was denied my FEMA claim for damage over $15,000 at my home, and they won’t do anything about it.\n\nI have family members that are still living in trailers. And just like Mark, their claims were denied. The local government, the state, they had food. They had everything. But as far as help from the government and FEMA, they didn’t offer the help you’d think they would.\n\nI watch both sides of the news, left and right, and try to get a common-sense truth among the polar opposite viewpoints politically. Local government and churches, they were more helpful. Definitely not FEMA. And they’re the ones that supposedly have all the money.\n\nI will tell you this till the day I die: If it had not been for people coming, volunteers coming from all over the United States — we saw people from Georgia and Florida and Oregon and California and Texas — I don’t know what these people would have done without the volunteers.\n\nThere have been a lot of different organizations that have really stepped up to do whatever they can. Some of them are funded by FEMA, and I’ve worked with a few of those. I want to make sure that everybody knows that FEMA did more than just work with those funds that directly came to us.\n\nI’m sure FEMA funds lots of different things, and I’m sure some of the money went to good use. But there was one organization that we were working with, donating water and things, and they would truck the supplies up to the mountains. My grandparents live up there and were without power and water. And to be fair, I know they want to make sure things are safe and things aren’t getting too crowded. But we simply weren’t allowed to go and bring supplies. So that was really frustrating.\n\nWhen it comes to the recovery from something like this, what do you think were the most helpful things that the government did?\n\nIn Asheville, we got a lot of attention. The Army Corps of Engineers came in to help rebuild and clean up the main water treatment plant. Their efforts were very quick, very direct, with constant updates.\n\nThe $700 they gave people, it was very demonized, a lot of controversy to say that that was all people got. But just the fact that people got that immediate funds to help buy supplies and do things — and, I mean, I wasn’t affected, but I know people who were.\n\nAre there any people, leaders or organizations that you think of more highly after seeing how they responded to the disaster?\n\nSamaritan’s Purse. They were doing a lot of volunteering and a lot of cleaning up for the western part of North Carolina, along with a lot of church leaders and organizations, too.\n\nLocal church leaders and local businesses.\n\nI would agree about Samaritan’s Purse. I know they had a huge volume of volunteers. I volunteered with them in Asheville.\n\nGiven my own family’s experience with denied claims, I’m just seeing a gray, negative cloud over everyone’s handling of it. I just think there wasn’t a lot of attention. I can kind of see offering a shaky hand for Biden-Harris. But it wasn’t enough. And even now, I don’t think that people understand that so much more help is needed. I think we’re almost forgotten.\n\nThere’s only so much either side can really do, you know? But I still put my hand up for Trump-Vance because the bare minimum you can do is just show up and show your support with the community and just be there and offer whatever resources you have. At least go see some of the devastation yourself and really understand and talk to the people.\n\nKirsten, you gave Biden-Harris at least a halfway raising of your hand on that one.\n\nThere were immediate funds released post-hurricane. Maybe you’d expect either presidency to do that, but that just happened to be the presidency at the time of the hurricane. They did fly over. I remember that. I think it was inappropriate to be on the ground. The roads were blocked, so I think that was the right thing to do, to fly over, not to actually be going into the town and closing the few roads we had open. And that’s something we saw with the Trump visit. I don’t know what Trump has done, if anything. I know he wants to gut FEMA. So how is that helpful? That’s my perspective.\n\nTrump got elected on Tuesday, and he was here on Friday. And I think those people needed to see that the government was there. I think they just needed reassurance, hope, whatever.\n\nWhat has the national media gotten right about how Helene affected you? What has it gotten wrong?\n\nI think there needs to be more attention to the stories of the people that are suffering. I would say it’s just not loud enough.\n\nI think that the media attention was so short-lived.\n\nAll the way down in Swannanoa, I saw people still in tents. They need to come back and show those people in tents. It’s almost forgotten. And I get it. You start living your life.\n\nIt’s like it’s old news.\n\nDid your experience with Helene change the way you think about other natural disasters, like the fires in Los Angeles?\n\nMy first thought was very selfishly like, “There goes any new support coverage for Western North Carolina. We’re moving on to the next big thing.” And rightfully so, on one hand, because that was devastating. But we’re always moving on to the next story. So it just felt like, “Well, here comes the end for our coverage.”\n\nI see a few people nodding.\n\nAnd then, of course, I also felt a complete sense of loss for them because how horrifying for all those people, whether they lost their homes or just smoke damage that makes their home uninhabitable. And third, concern about FEMA — we were lucky to get a lot of money in 2024. So the 2025 bucket is probably going heavily out there. And then what does that leave for the rest of the storm season for the rest of the U.S.?\n\nYou had the fires in Hawaii, which has now been — what? — two years ago, and they haven’t rebuilt yet. Now you’ve got all these fires in California. How long is it going to take to rebuild that? How long is it going to take to rebuild Western North Carolina? The whole system of fixing things is broken. Everything that’s supposed to be in place is not there.\n\nHas this experience changed how you think about where you live in the United States? For the people who feel there’s a climate change element here, do you feel like the government helps you make decisions about where to live? Has anything about this experience changed how you think about the kind of home or neighborhood or place you would live in if you moved?\n\nThe last flooding we had in this area was, like, a hundred years ago. So I know this was just a fluke. I better knock on wood that it was a fluke. But I don’t think it would make me change.\n\nI know now that I need to be more prepared, that I need to have as many resources as I possibly can for myself. I was a kid as well when Hurricane Hugo came through. And then I went through this one. So it changed my thinking — not expecting that the government would come through and help. Or if they did, I felt like they just did drive-bys.\n\nI would just stay right where I am. It’s all part of nature and life.\n\nI used to worry about the disasters where I’d live but not anymore. Not at all.\n\nSydney mentioned tip sheets at the beginning of our call. There were a lot of claims swirling around last year, some of which turned out to be false. Do you trust FEMA to give accurate information about things like this?\n\nI don’t trust FEMA. It’s not really saying anything bad about FEMA. I think that the state should handle stuff like that because FEMA, when I did see FEMA, they had no idea about the area. They didn’t know the hollers and places like that. So while giving them credit for what they do, they were almost lost in some cases.\n\nUnpopular opinion: I think FEMA serves a very valuable purpose as the federal response to handle emergency management situations, like the California fires and all the things we have. I mean, Helene hit Florida. It hit Georgia. It hit South Carolina. It was not just Western North Carolina. I think it was a very difficult job because of things that Nina just talked about, all the little hollers and areas up there in the terrain. But I’m scared of losing FEMA or having FEMA be cut and when the next hurricane or natural disaster happens under this administration or moving forward. FEMA is not perfect, but I think it serves a valuable purpose.\n\nI just don’t trust the government hardly at all, anyway, for a lot of reasons, federal government and state. I’m going to say more services should be privatized. Even FEMA could be privatized, I think.\n\nI think there is value to what FEMA does. But I want it ensured that the money’s going to the communities that need help. And I do have a distrust for the government in general. I just want to make sure that the tax dollars they collect go to these communities and go to things that are really going to benefit the country.\n\nThis is a great time to bring up insurance, because that is a form of coverage, privatized coverage. We’ve talked a lot about FEMA, government support. We’re losing insurance in Florida and California and coastal North Carolina because of natural disasters. We pay into it. That’s a private-ish way to get your money back. And a lot of these insurance claims are denied 100 percent. So I think we’ve tried that, and it failed.\n\nOn the topic of insurance: There are some parts of the country where we know natural disasters are more likely, places where we know floods, fires or storms are expected. And in some of those places lately, these private insurers have started leaving markets. What do you think should be done when it comes to insuring people who live in areas that private insurers do not want to insure anymore?\n\nInsurance — that’s a huge part of the problem. They paid my claim but didn’t cover near everything that they should have. But insurance needs to replace these houses and everything. It is crazy. They keep raising the cost, and what do you get in return? I mean, I guess you do get some peace of mind, but there’s so many different riders.\n\nWell, I had experience with the insurance company, and I called them twice a day, every day. I didn’t have any problems. They paid my claims, but it’s probably because I bugged them to death. They were sick of hearing from me. And to be honest with you, I have no idea how to solve that.\n\nI just think that any insurer that is going to be on the market, there should be something that our government puts down that says, “If you are going to function as a business, you are required to provide your services to anyone willing to pay for it.” And there should be a limit to how much that person needs to pay, because we don’t want it where there’s suddenly price gouging. But everyone should be able to get insurance. And the government is one of those entities that can step in and help make that happen.\n\nIf you could tell government officials one thing about your experience as someone who lived through Helene or has watched as close family members and friends have gone through this, what would you say?\n\nI wish the government would know what the victims went through, actually. I want the government to be more helpful, to be more in tune with them.\n\nTake a chapter from the local response. I know the government on a federal level has way more resources than local. But I just wish that they would have a continued and forceful effort in the way that local government has.\n\nPeople are really suffering out there. And they need to really step up their game and send people the help that they need.\n\nI would say that these are real people that did not think that this would ever happen to them in the mountains, and that means it could happen anywhere.\n\nHave better coordination with local volunteer efforts. I think that was a big problem, that they weren’t listening to the people in the street who were trying to help and were taking a little bit too much control.\n\nMake readiness a priority, be more proactive and prioritize funds so that we are fully prepared to handle these situations.\n\nI wish they would understand how cold it is in the winter in the mountains.

        "full_text": "In the run up to today's call, Donald Trump made a big deal of his conversation with Russia's Vladimir Putin.\n\nBut the results look like there's little to shout about.\n\nThe Russian president has given the US leader just enough to claim that he made progress towards peace in Ukraine, without making it look like he was played by the Kremlin.\n\nTrump can point to Putin's pledge to halt attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure for 30 days. If that actually happens, it will bring some relief to civilians.\n\nBut it's nowhere near the full and unconditional ceasefire that the US wanted from Russia.\n\nThe \"very horrible war\" Trump has insisted he can stop is still raging.\n\nAnd Putin, a man indicted as a suspected war criminal by the ICC, has been given a leg-up back to the top tier of global politics.\n\nRussian state media report that the two presidents' phone call lasted more than two hours. The Kremlin readout – its account of the call – is also long at 500 words.\n\nIt presents the conversation as chatty: they apparently discussed ice hockey, the kind of detail an audience back in Russia will lap up.\n\nAfter three years as a pariah in the western world, and frosty relations long before that, Russia is back dealing directly with a US administration that wants to engage.\n\nThe two leaders are even discussing Middle East peace and \"global security\".\n\nThe Kremlin must be struggling to believe the transformation.\n\nAhead of the call, some wondered whether Donald Trump might actually pile some pressure on Russia. After all, it's been clear for over a week that it was stalling on the ceasefire.\n\nBut there's no sign of a dressing down for Putin like the one Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky had to endure in the Oval Office a fortnight ago.\n\nBoth countries' accounts suggest nothing has changed.\n\nRussia repeats that it wants peace. But instead of grounding its drones and silencing its guns, it's quibbling over how a still non-existent ceasefire might be monitored.\n\nMeanwhile, it's adding even more conditions aimed at crippling Kyiv's ability to resist.\n\nOne demand is that the flow of both weapons and intelligence to Ukraine from its allies has to cease.\n\nFor Ukrainians, the only sliver of hope is that the US hasn't agreed to any of this – yet.\n\nThey can also point to the call as more proof that Russia has no interest in ending its invasion.\n\nBut all that talking will bring Ukraine minimal relief from its suffering.\n\nFor US diplomacy, too, it has to be disappointing.\n\nBut for the Kremlin it will feel like a pretty decent day, the kind unimaginable before Donald Trump returned to the White House.",

        "full_text": "A federal judge on Tuesday blocked the EPA from clawing back some $20 billion in climate money the Trump administration said was shoved out the door by a departing Biden administration.\n\nU.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan said the Environmental Protection Agency gave “no legal justification” for why it tried to reclaim the money or given the recipients of the money no chance to object or challenge the decision.\n\nShe issued a temporary restraining order against the EPA.\n\n“To be sure, agencies can decide to re-evaluate their programs, or they may decide to end agreements or federal awards. But those decisions must be made lawfully and in accordance with established procedures and relevant rules and regulations,” the judge wrote.\n\nThe money had become symbolic of the Biden administration’s last-minute efforts to “Trump-proof” the government.\n\nProject Veritas late last year captured an official revealing EPA’s plans to push money out the door, in what he compared to “throwing gold bars off the Titanic.”\n\nNew EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin made it his mission to recapture the money, and earlier this month he declared success.\n\n“The days of ‘throwing gold bars off the Titanic’ are over,” he said. “I have taken action to terminate these grants riddled with self-dealing and wasteful spending. EPA will be an exceptional steward of taxpayer dollars dedicated to our core mission of protecting human health and the environment, not a frivolous spender in the name of ’climate equity.’”\n\nHe said the Biden administration was unable to spend all the money before it left but it “parked” the funds at Citibank. Mr. Zeldin pressed Citibank to stop releasing the money to the organizations that won the grants from the Biden administration.\n\nThe money was part of Democrats’ 2022 climate-budget bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, which pumped a massive amount of taxpayer money into clean energy and environmental grants.",

        "full_text": "What’s the latest? Putin and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy are each supporting a 30-day pause in attacks on “energy and infrastructure,” such as power plants and refineries. The planned pause follows a lengthy phone call between Trump and Putin earlier today.\n\nPutin did not agree to a full ceasefire, which Trump has proposed and which Ukraine had assented to earlier. Russia put out a post-call statement suggesting that it would only agree if foreign countries cut off military and intelligence aid to Ukraine — a demand Trump has not agreed to.\n\nWhat hasn’t changed? Fighting along the front lines, and presumably also drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities, will continue. The US will also continue providing weapons and intelligence to Ukraine, after briefly suspending both earlier this month.\n\nWhat’s the big picture for Ukraine? The optimistic take on what happened today is that the two sides are talking — via the US — and that this could be the basis for a broader ceasefire. On the other hand, recent statements from Russian officials suggest they’re still pushing for a demilitarized and subservient Ukraine. And Putin may be doing just enough to keep Trump happy while continuing to press his advantage on the battlefield.\n\nWhat did we learn about Trump? Trump didn’t totally sell Ukraine out, which seemed like a real possibility just a few weeks ago. On the other hand, he also doesn’t seem to put pressure on Russia to agree to a real ceasefire, as he did with Ukraine. Trump’s own statement about the call makes it seem like he was satisfied with the result, despite Putin’s unwillingness to back down.\n\nPart of the lure of social media is the promise of external validation, and so I really appreciated this piece from my Vox colleague Allie Volpe. It explains why we’re hard-wired to seek validation — and how we can avoid being trapped by that need. I particularly loved this line: “What is far more nourishing than the sugar high of validation is an internal process of recognizing your own worthiness.”\n\nIt’s easier said than done, but, for me at least, it’s a good aspiration.

        "full_text": "Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino.\n\nFollowing the release of the latest jobs report on March 7, President Donald Trump suggested that his administration — which has been in office since Jan. 20 — is responsible for significant job growth. The growth in February was steady, but to support his claims, Trump made several misleading statements about the economy he inherited.\n\nThe February jobs report delivered on expectations, saying that the economy added 151,000 jobs — slightly below the forecasted 160,000. The unemployment rate was 4.1%, up marginally from 4% in January.\n\nEconomists described the report as showing a generally steady labor market for now, with Brookings Institution fellow and University of Michigan professor Justin Wolfers calling the report “splendidly dull.”\n\nWe’ll unpack three of the claims Trump made on March 7 during his remarks from the Oval Office about the report.\n\nThe president compared the 9,000 new auto manufacturing jobs in February to a loss of more than 27,000 jobs in President Joe Biden’s last year — ignoring that there was a net gain of those jobs over Biden’s entire term. He also suggested that his tariff policy was responsible for the new jobs, but Trump’s tariffs had not yet been enacted in the period covered by the jobs report.\n\nHe claimed to be “presiding over a brand-new domestic manufacturing boom after major collapse under Biden,” but an expert told us he’s been in office for too short of a time to have effected any major economic change. And the data show there was a net gain in manufacturing jobs during Biden’s administration.\n\nTrump cherry-picked data to misleadingly claim that “1 in every 4 jobs created in America was a government job” in Biden’s last two years as president, while “93% of all job gains” during the first full month of Trump’s second term “were in the private sector.” During Biden’s entire presidency, about 11% of the jobs added were government jobs, the vast majority of which were state and local government jobs.\n\nAuto Manufacturing Jobs\n\nTrump highlighted gains in auto manufacturing jobs, saying, “in a single month, 9,000 new auto jobs. You haven’t heard that in a long time. After autoworkers lost more than 27,000 auto jobs in the final year of Biden.”\n\nTrump’s figures are correct, but over Biden’s entire term, auto manufacturing jobs went up.\n\nWhile there hasn’t been monthly job growth since July, over Biden’s term, motor vehicle and parts jobs went up by 47,000. Employment in January was 9,900 higher than the pre-pandemic level in February 2020.\n\nAnd while Trump claimed that before the February increase, there hadn’t been such a large one-month jump “in a long time,” there were larger one-month increases under Biden. The February jobs report showed an increase since January of 8,900 jobs in the manufacturing of motor vehicles and parts. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there was an increase of 28,400 jobs in that sector between October and November 2023.\n\nAlso, just because the one-month increase happened while Trump is in office doesn’t necessarily mean that he’s responsible for it, Alan Tonelson, a longtime analyst of U.S. manufacturing policy who blogs at RealityChek, told us in a phone interview.\n\nThe kinds of decisions that result in jobs are long-term decisions, Tonelson said, using the example of new factories, which take time to build.\n\nTrump, though, claimed that his tariff policies had already affected the February job numbers. He said the reason for the one-month gain was “largely” because car companies “think things are happening, so they’re already geared up. In some cases, they had rooms in their plants, or they had empty plants that they were able to put into use quickly because they see — because of the tariffs. They don’t want to be dealing with other places,” he said, mentioning Mexico and Canada.\n\nWhen we asked the White House about the president’s claim, it provided examples of auto companies making announcements about new plants or production. But most of the plans began before Trump took office, and it’s unclear if any of them led to new jobs in February.\n\nThe White House pointed to production at a Georgia Hyundai plant. Construction of the vehicle and battery manufacturing plant was announced in 2022, and it began producing electric cars in October. However, the CEO, José Muñoz, has pointed to Hyundai’s investment in U.S. production over the last few years as insulation from potential tariffs from the Trump administration.\n\nThe White House also pointed to two announcements of plants opening — for electric batteries and electric vehicles — but the projects were in the works well before Trump’s election.\n\nIt also cited a $1.5 million Michigan Economic Development Program grant that is anticipated to create 144 jobs manufacturing hydrogen fuel cells and plans for a Chicago-area assembly plant to reopen in 2027. Plans to reopen the assembly plant were announced shortly after the company’s chairman met with Trump and months after a pressure campaign from the United Auto Workers. But neither of those projects has produced jobs yet.\n\nAnd the White House pointed to the same March 3 Reuters story that the president appeared to reference in his address to a joint session of Congress on March 4, when he said that Honda had announced it would build a new plant in Indiana. But after that address, Honda told a news station in Indianapolis: “Honda has made no such announcement and will not comment on this report. The Honda Civic has been made in our Indiana Auto Plant since the facility opened in 2008 based on our longstanding approach to build products close to the customer. We have the flexibility to produce products in each region based on customer needs and market conditions.”\n\nSo, it’s unclear if Honda is planning to change its Indiana operations due to tariffs, but no jobs associated with any potential change would have been included in the February report, either.\n\nIt remains to be seen what impact Trump’s tariff policies might have on the auto industry. So far, 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel imports went into effect on March 12, with the EU and Canada immediately implementing retaliatory tariffs. Broad 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, including on vehicles, are largely on hold until April 2.\n\nSome industry watchers have been skeptical of the benefits from tariffs for the auto industry. “Ultimately, in a global automotive business that relies on a large and complicated supply chain, higher tariffs will only challenge further an industry already wrestling with high costs and small margins,” Cox Automotive wrote in an early February analysis.\n\nManufacturing Jobs\n\nThe president also said, “Our administration is presiding over a brand-new domestic manufacturing boom after major collapse under Biden.”\n\nBut the data don’t support that claim.\n\nTrump said, “During the last year, the Biden administration saw a loss of more than 110,000 manufacturing jobs. … During the first full month in office, we’ve not only stopped that manufacturing collapse, but we’ve begun to rapidly reverse it and get major gains. We created 10,000 manufacturing jobs in February alone. That hasn’t happened in a long time.”\n\nThere was a 20,000 gain in manufacturing jobs in November, so it has only been a few months since there has been such a one-month increase.\n\nTrump is correct about the net loss over Biden’s last year — it was 111,000 — but again, over Biden’s four years, manufacturing jobs went up by 610,000. In January, there were almost 12.8 million manufacturing jobs, 12,000 more than in February 2020, before the pandemic.\n\nFactory construction also reached the highest level in more than 50 years in 2024, according to a report from Moody’s Analytics.\n\nForbes wrote last year that Biden-era policies, including the CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act, “spurred an influx of foreign direct investment and a surge in factory construction. But the anticipated jobs have taken a while to materialize in great numbers and will not arrive until after his presidency ends.”\n\nWhen Trump touted the “brand-new domestic manufacturing boom,” he said that it had been “confirmed” by the ISM and S&P manufacturing surveys, which are conducted by private companies that survey purchasing managers to provide an indicator of economic conditions.\n\nThe surveys did report expansion in manufacturing.\n\nThe S&P survey reported that “February survey data indicated an acceleration in the rate of US manufacturing sector expansion.” However, it said there was “some evidence” that the growth was “partially driven by advanced purchases ahead of likely price increases and possible supply disruption related to further tariff impositions in the coming months.”\n\nThe ISM for February said that the sector “expanded for the second month in a row in February after 26 consecutive months of contraction.” Many survey respondents reporting uncertainty and volatility due to tariffs.\n\n“Manufacturing, generally speaking, is cyclical,” Tonelson said. “Manufacturing is quite export heavy,” so it depends on what’s happening in other countries, too.\n\nBut, overall, Tonelson said, “I don’t think that one can make any reasonable conclusion about booming of anything after just about a month and a half. In terms of manufacturing jobs, we’ve only got one month of data on President Trump’s watch this time.”\n\nPublic vs. Private Jobs\n\nTrump also used cherry-picked statistics when comparing government and private-sector jobs added under him and Biden.\n\n“Under the final two years of Biden, 1 in every 4 jobs created in America was a government job. That’s a tremendous percentage,” he said. “But under the first full month of President Trump, which we haven’t even gotten started yet, an incredible 93% of all job gains were in the private sector.”\n\nIt’s true that about one-quarter, or roughly 26%, of the jobs added in Biden’s last two years in office were government jobs, which includes positions in federal, state and local government. However, during Biden’s entire presidency, about 11% of the jobs added were government jobs — including some jobs that were lost, but quickly regained, during the pandemic. And about 9 in 10 of the government jobs gained were at the state and local level, which Biden had no direct say in.\n\nMeasuring from June 2022, when total employment finally surpassed the pre-pandemic high in February 2020, about 22% of the increase in employment was government jobs. Again, roughly 90% of the jobs were in state and local government.\n\nIt’s also misleading to compare one month of private-sector job growth at the start of Trump’s second term — about 93% of the jobs gained in February were private-sector jobs, as Trump said — to a much longer period under Biden.\n\nFor instance, in December, one of Biden’s final months in office, only 11% of all jobs added were government jobs. A month before that in November, it was about 6.5%. There were also a few months during Biden’s last two years in office when there was an increase in total jobs but a decline in government jobs.",

        "full_text": "Rep. Brandon Gill of Texas, a conservative hard-liner, quickly followed through on Trump’s call, filing a measure to remove U.S. District Judge James Boasberg for seeking to “prioritize political gain over the duty of impartiality owed to the public.”\n\nImpeachment proceedings, even when they don’t involve presidents, can be time- and resource-intensive affairs. Boasberg, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, is the fourth federal trial judge this year to be targeted with an impeachment filing from a congressional Republican after ruling against the Trump administration. But his is the first to draw backing from Trump.\n\nPublicly, key GOP leaders are not closing the door on potential impeachments.\n\n“Everything is on the table,” said Russell Dye, a spokesperson for House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who would oversee impeachment proceedings. A Johnson spokesperson said judges “with political agendas pose a significant threat” and that the speaker “looks forward to working with the Judiciary Committee as they review all available options under the Constitution to address this urgent matter.”\n\nBut privately there is dread inside Johnson’s leadership circle about the prospect of having to pursue messy, certain-to-fail impeachments that could ultimately backfire on the GOP’s razor-thin majority.\n\n“It’s never going to happen,” said a senior House Republican aide. “There aren’t the votes.”\n\n“It would be such a heavy lift and we’ve got too many heavy lifts coming up,” said another top GOP aide. “What is the endgame here?”\n\nA third said GOP leaders and even some conservative House members are “rolling their eyes” at the impeachment filings that “aren’t going to go anywhere.”\n\nThe decision on how hard to push will ultimately fall to Johnson, a former constitutional lawyer who has so far resisted the hard-liners’ push to wage what many within his own leadership circle view as an unprecedented and wide-reaching congressional assault on the courts.\n\nBut Trump’s intervention this time could change that calculation — even as he stares down a punishing self-imposed deadline for advancing a massive tax, energy and border policy package before his members leave Washington next month for the Easter and Passover break. Johnson is heavily reliant on Trump to maintain his tenuous control over his fractious conference, and senior Republicans believe the speaker will likely need to offer some sort of concession to serve as a release valve as pressure builds on the MAGA right.\n\nFellow hard-liners cheered Gill on Tuesday, but there were signs of discomfort elsewhere in the House GOP.\n\n“I don’t support it,” said Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.). “If their behavior was criminal, that is different.”\n\n“I do not support impeaching a sitting judge based solely on a decision with which I disagree,” said another House GOP lawmaker, granted anonymity to speak candidly, who nevertheless agreed that Boasberg had “overstepped his authority” in ordering the halt to deportations under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act.\n\nBoth members echoed Chief Justice John Roberts in arguing that the courts, not Congress, were the proper place for Trump to address an adverse ruling.\n\nOutside of the House, there appears to be even less of an appetite for impeachment.\n\nIn the Senate, which would be required to take up any impeachment as soon as articles come over from the House, Republicans have previously greeted the idea with disdain.\n\n“Idiotic,” said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) when asked about the proposed judicial impeachments earlier this month, before Trump weighed in.\n\n“You don’t impeach judges who make decisions you disagree with, because that happens all the time,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said around the same time. “What you do is you appeal, and if you’re right, then you’re going to win on appeal.”\n\nBoth men sit on the Senate Judiciary Committee, whose chair, Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), has spoken out about the need to “solve the problem of judicial overreach,” citing trial court orders that have national impacts, but has not commented on the calls for impeachments.\n\nSome conservative lawyers with close ties to the administration have also warned against such a confrontation with the judiciary.\n\n“Unpopular opinion: No judge will be impeached in connection with activist unconstitutional TRO’s & injunctions against the Trump Administration,” attorney Ron Coleman, a former law partner of Trump White House Counsel David Warrington, wrote on X amid a prior flurry of impeachment talk. “Strategically the Administration would be insane to try.”\n\nColeman stood his ground Tuesday, saying he supports Roberts’ statement urging politicians not to impeach judges over their rulings.\n\nDespite Trump’s public posting Tuesday, it remains unclear just how hard he will push for impeachments of Boasberg or any other judges who have questioned his powers. Multiple Republicans close to the issue on the Hill say that Trump has not urged them to impeach anyone. But that could change if judges continue to hand down unfavorable rulings.\n\nA small faction of Trump’s most diehard Hill supporters have been railing against the judiciary for weeks already — and are likely to keep the heat on Johnson to move forward.\n\nWhile there is wide skepticism about the impeachment efforts — some Republicans have privately noted errors in some of the articles already filed — there are more serious talks among conservatives about trying to block funding for lower-level courts.\n\n“They’re activists trying to stifle his agenda … radical left-leaning nutjobs in black robes trying to stop Trump,” said Rep. Troy Nehls (R-Texas), adding that lawmakers need to “send a message” even if the impeachments don’t ultimately succeed.\n\nRoberts’ decision to speak out Tuesday only emboldened the GOP’s right flank, which has never been especially fond of the George W. Bush–nominated chief justice.\n\n“Respectfully, Mr. Chief Justice, both James Madison and Thomas Jefferson disagree with you. So does the Constitution,” read an X posting from Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.), who filed impeachment articles against two federal judges last month.\n\n“We are going to keep the impeachments coming,” Ogles added.",

        "full_text": "Republican lawmakers are conflicted over how to respond to President Trump’s confrontational standoff with the federal judiciary, which drew a rare public rebuke Tuesday from Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nTrump and his allies are directing their attacks more frequently against judges who threaten to slow or block the president’s ambitious agenda, putting GOP lawmakers in an uncomfortable spot.\n\nRepublican officeholders are leery of criticizing Trump for fear of becoming the target of his wrath or a primary challenge, yet privately they worry about the president’s efforts to expand his executive power, which could reverberate far into the future.\n\nWhile a few Republican senators and House members have publicly cheered the Trump administration in its battle with a federal judge who ordered it to halt the deportation of several hundred Venezuelans to El Salvador, many more are keeping quiet.\n\n“Republicans, by and large, will support Trump publicly because of the situation — we’re dealing with Venezuelan gang members, and most Americans agree they should have been deported,” a senior Republican strategist said of the reaction to the Trump administration going forward with a deportation flights despite an order by a federal judge to stop them.\n\n“Privately, most congressional Republicans will think this is really going right up to the line on having a constitutional crisis, and that situations like this need to be avoided in the future,” the strategist added. “They do believe in due process.\n\n“There will be future situations where hearings are necessary, and continuing to go against judicial rulings will be politically precarious for Trump,” the strategist warned, noting Trump’s direct challenge to federal judge’s authority caught many lawmakers off guard Tuesday.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have urged Trump to heed the federal court rulings he disagrees with and to challenge them in the appeals process instead of flouting court orders.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said last month that “the White House should comply with court rulings,” voicing a concern shared by a number of GOP lawmakers.\n\n“We have a judicial system. If you don’t like the ruling, you can appeal the ruling and you can follow that through. But we are a nation of laws, and it is not necessarily for you or I to be the final arbiter here. This is why we entrust the judiciary with this responsibility,” she said.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) has said the courts have a “valid role and need to be listened to.”\n\nThey and many other GOP lawmakers didn’t address the issue Tuesday after Trump called for the impeachment of Judge James Boasberg, the chief judge of the federal district court of the District of Columbia, who ordered the halting of flights carrying people to El Salvador.\n\nTrump called the judge, who was appointed to his seat by former President Obama, “a troublemaker and agitator.”\n\n“This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges’ I am forced to appear before, should be impeached!!” he declared on Truth Social, suggesting many the deportees were “VICIOUS, VIOLENT AND DEMENTED CRIMINALS.”\n\nThat statement drew pushback from Roberts, who declared that threatening to impeach the judge over a legal disagreement is “inappropriate.”\n\nThe Trump administration sought to deport the migrants under the Aliens Enemies Act of 1798, a seldom-cited law that previously has been invoked during times of war.\n\nTrump’s call for impeaching Boasberg was immediately supported by Rep. Brandon Gill (R-Texas), who introduced a resolution to impeach Boasberg.\n\nThe idea of impeaching federal judges who rule against Trump was not popular with Senate Republicans when tech billionaire Elon Musk, one of Trump’s closest advisors, floated it last month.\n\n“Wrong, wrong, wrong. Get him out of the White House. Get him out, the sooner the better,” one GOP senator told The Hill last month.\n\n“Every day that he’s there, he seems more destructive,” the source said of Musk.\n\nThe Republican strategist warned that Trump’s battle with Republican-appointed jurists such as Roberts is a bad look for the president, politically.\n\n“Trump is once again breaking norms,” the strategist said. “It does raise the visibility of [the issue] and I don’t think it intimidates the judges, either.\n\n“If power ends up in a Democratic White House and [a Democratic president] ignores judicial rulings, Republicans will be reminded of his situation. Hopefully, this is an anomaly,” the source added. “Behind the scenes, they believe in an independent judiciary and they don’t want Trump messing with it.”\n\nFormer Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) said Trump’s attack on the judge puts Republican lawmakers in a difficult position.\n\n“When you arbitrarily try to cancel the rule of law, which is what Trump is trying to do, and lead by the edict of an individual, whether he is president or not, you’re creating almost a banana republic-type of event,” he warned.\n\n“The fact that members of the Republican Party would introduce articles of impeachment [against the judge] is an inexcusable abrogation of their obligation as members of the Congress,” he said.\n\n“How does it affect Republicans? Significantly. Because even though senior Republicans in the Senate may disagree and hopefully would disagree strongly, it’s the president who’s head of the party and is defining the party,” Gregg warned. “If you’re running as a Republican against a Democrat, or anybody else, you’re going to be painted with the brush that you don’t think the rule of law should apply in America anymore.”\n\nThe Justice Department on Tuesday complied with Boasberg’s order for sworn statements acknowledging that the deported Venezuelan migrants, allegedly members of the Tren de Aragua gang, arrived in El Salvador after the judge issued verbal and written orders to stop the deportations.\n\nThe judge asked Justice Department officials to explain why two deportation flights continued on from Honduras to El Salvador after he issued his orders.\n\nThe Trump administration’s lawyers argued Monday that Boasberg’s order wasn’t violated because the judge does not have the jurisdiction to overrule the president’s powers as commander in chief.\n\nTwo prominent Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee rallied to Trump’s defense.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on Sunday accused Boasberg of “unilaterally deciding policy for the whole country” and vowed to investigate.\n\n“This time to benefit foreign gang members,” he posted on the social platform X, referring to the court order. “If the Supreme Court or Congress doesn’t fix, we’re headed toward a constitutional crisis.\n\n“Senate Judiciary Cmte taking action,” he added.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), another member of the Judiciary Committee, posted on X that “Democrats would rather defend known terrorists and cartel gangsters than let President Trump do his job of keeping our country safe.”\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc.

        "full_text": "President Donald Trump is deporting immigrants -- 11,000 last month.\n\nSome people are unhappy about that.\n\nLast week, a judge ordered a stop to Trump's removal of Venezuelan nationals. (Deportation happened anyway.)\n\nI definitely want immigrant criminals deported.\n\nTrump says migrant crime is \"happening at levels that nobody thought possible!\"\n\nBut that's not true.\n\nResearching my new video, I learned that immigrants are actually less likely to get into trouble than native-born Americans.\n\nTexas, the only state that tracks immigrant crime, compares convictions per 100,000 Americans. Score: illegal immigrants, 782; legal immigrants, 535; native-born Americans, 1,422. It's the opposite of what most of us have heard.\n\nBut even if immigrants are less likely to commit crimes, there are other reasons to object to immigration:\n\n1) Immigrants take jobs away from Americans.\n\n2) They freeload off our welfare system.\n\n3) They threaten our culture.\n\nI'll take them point-by-point.\n\nTucker Carlson complains, \"These new rivals compete primarily with the very Americans most likely to have lost their jobs.\"\n\nHe's right. Migrants take jobs from some Americans, and some Americans are out of work. But unemployment is relatively low: 4.1%. It was 8.8% when I was first hired by ABC.\n\nToday, companies complain that they can't find enough people willing to show up on time and work.\n\nIn addition, \"Every serious economic study,\" says Yaron Brook of the Ayn Rand Institute, shows immigrants \"create more jobs than they destroy.You might lose your job, but you live now in a society that has ... more opportunities because many immigrants are entrepreneurs.\"\n\nThey sure are. Immigrants started Space X, eBay, Instacart, Uber, NVIDIA, SanDisk, etc.\n\n\"We benefit enormously from our interaction with immigrants,\" says Brook. \"Who has the right to stop us from that interaction?! ... It's like saying: 'I have a right to stagnate and to force all of you to stagnate with me.'\"\n\nWhat about the second point? Immigrants freeloading off welfare? Illegal immigrants actually don't qualify for most benefits, but some politicians give tax money away anyway. Some give migrants credit cards. Also, immigrants' kids often attend public schools, hospitals treat them for free (seems cruel not to) and they benefit from public services available to everyone in America.\n\n\"The way to deal with that is not to restrict immigration,\" says Brook. \"Deal with that by restricting the goodies.\"\n\nWhy not restrict immigration?\n\n\"Immigrants are a massive benefit to Americans,\" he says.\n\nIt's true.\n\nTrump says, \"Legal immigration. I like it. We need people.\"\n\nBut even illegal immigrants are a net gain. Not just because they harvest our food, do construction, etc., but also because Social Security and Medicare taxes are deducted from their paychecks. That's money they never get back, because they're not legal.\n\nAs a result, undocumented immigrants pay more into our economy than they get back.\n\nSome Americans say, \"I support immigration, but migrants should get in line and obey the laws.\"\n\nBut for most migrants, that's almost impossible.\n\nUnder our current rules, many would have to wait more than 100 years!\n\n\"Legal immigration is unbelievably complicated,\" says Brook. \"It's almost impossible to come here.\"\n\nTrump proposes selling a type of green card for $5 million.\n\nMaybe that's a good idea.\n\nBrook says, \"Let in anyone with a job offer.\" That's a good idea.\n\nBut then there's concern number three: \"We are bringing in peasant cultures,\" complains pundit Ann Coulter.\n\nBrook replies, \"There are good people in every culture. When (the) Irish came, they were accused of being barbarians. Every wave of immigrants has been accused of the same thing. The fact is ... they assimilate quite well, no matter where they come from.\"\n\nI push back, \"Some are Muslim fundamentalists who bring in ideas we don't like. Some are socialists.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Brook answers, \"But if we are confident in the ideas that we have, individual rights ... capitalism and liberty, we should fight for those ideas. It's Americans who teach at our universities that the Founding Fathers were terrible human beings.\"\n\nBy contrast, most immigrants like America!\n\nLet more in.\n\nEvery Tuesday at JohnStossel.com, Stossel posts a new video about the battle between government and freedom.",

He said the Russian leader had in effect rejected a comprehensive ceasefire in his call on Tuesday with US President Donald Trump.\n\nPutin told Trump a full ceasefire would only work if Ukraine's allies stopped giving military assistance - a condition Ukraine's European allies have previously rejected.\n\nOfficials in the southern Russian region of Krasnodar said that a Ukrainian drone attack sparked a small fire at an oil depot.\n\nWithin hours of Putin agreeing to halt attacks on energy infrastructure, Zelensky said there had been \"hits, specifically on civilian infrastructure\", including a hospital in Sumy.\n\nThe region's government posted footage of the destruction, in which smoke can be seen rising from the caved-in hospital wing. Officials have since said that there had been no casualties.\n\nZelensky said that Russia launched more than 40 drones against Ukraine in the hours following the call between Trump and Putin.\n\n\"It is these types of night-time attacks by Russia that destroy our energy sector, our infrastructure, and the normal life of Ukrainians,\" Zelensky said.\n\n\"Today, Putin effectively rejected the proposal for a full ceasefire.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian president also confirmed that a call would take place between him and Trump on Wednesday, but gave no further details.\n\nMeanwhile, the Russian defence ministry said of the 57 Ukrainian drones it intercepted and destroyed overnight, 35 were over the Kursk border region.\n\nIn Belgorod, a Russian region on the border with Ukraine, the governor said the situation \"remains difficult\". Moscow said on Tuesday that Ukrainian forces attempted a ground assault on Belgorod but were pushed back.\n\nThe two countries also carried out their latest prisoner exchange on Wednesday, involving the release of 175 prisoners of war each. Zelensky said an additional 22 \"severely wounded\" Ukrainian soldiers were also freed.\n\nPutin rejected an immediate and full ceasefire in Ukraine, agreeing only to halt attacks on energy infrastructure, following a much-anticipated call with Trump.\n\nThe Russian leader declined to sign up to the comprehensive month-long ceasefire that Trump's team recently worked out with Ukrainians in Saudi Arabia.\n\nBut Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia and the US will agree either today or on Thursday the dates and attendees of their next meeting.\n\nUS talks on Ukraine are due to continue on Sunday in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the US envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, said.\n\nAbout 80% of Ukraine's energy infrastructure has been destroyed by Russian bombs, Zelensky said last September.\n\nKyiv has in turn conducted drone and missile strikes deep into Russian territory, on oil and gas facilities.",

        "full_text": "The FBI has handed over to Congress key documents related to Biden-era “weaponization” scandals at the Justice Department following a subpoena from House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan.\n\nFBI Assistant Director Marshall Yates sent a letter to Jordan on Friday vowing that “under Director Kash Patel's leadership, the FBI is dedicated to working with Congress towards transparency,” according to a copy of the letter obtained by Just the News, with the FBI official providing the House with internal bureau records tied to former Attorney General Merrick Garland’s divisive school board memorandum aimed at protesting parents.\n\nThe records also include the Richmond, Va., FBI field office’s since-retracted memo targeting Catholics, and the bureau’s controversial investigations enforcing the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act.\n\nJordan, who has long sought answers on “the weaponization of federal law enforcement against the American people” under former President Joe Biden, filed a subpoena with Patel’s FBI in late February, arguing that the bureau “refused any real transparency or accountability for its actions” during former Director Christopher Wray’s tenure and arguing that Wray had ignored several subpoenas Jordan had issued.\n\nThe Ohio Republican argued to Patel last month that “it is important that you succeed in restoring public confidence and creating much-needed transparency.” The new documents the FBI handed over may be a step in that direction.\n\n\"We are thankful for Director Patel's work, and we will have more updates soon,\" Jordan's spokesman Russell Dye told Just the News.\n\nThe FBI said in its new letter that, in response to Jordan’s subpoena related to Garland's school board memorandum, “additional documents” from the bureau were being handed over, including “the FBI summaries of the outstanding ‘EDUOFFICIALS’-tagged Guardians not previously provided to Congress due to their then-ongoing investigative status or classification.”\n\nThe FBI said that “one of these additional, now closed Guardians is classified and we will arrange delivery of this information with Committee staff at their convenience” but that “we have confirmed that there were no additional Guardians that have received the ‘EDUOFFICIALS’ threat tag since the FBI's prior productions to the Committee in August 2022.”\n\nJordan’s late February letter to Patel said that he “still has unanswered questions about how the FBI quickly operationalized” Garland’s October 2021 memo which had directed the Biden-era Justice Department and FBI to investigate alleged threats posed by outspoken parents.\n\nJordan also had remaining concerns about “whether the FBI objected to the civil liberties infringements inherent in the Attorney General’s memorandum.”\n\nJordan revealed whistleblower evidence in November 2021 which indicated that FBI counterterrorism assets were involved in the investigation of parents protesting school policies. He released an unclassified internal FBI email at the time showing that the bureau's counterterrorism chief sent instructions to FBI officials to use a \"threat tag\" to track any complaints involving parents and school officials.\n\nIn January, Attorney General Pam Bondi used a little-noticed footnote to rescind Garland’s memo.\n\nIn last Friday’s letter, the FBI said that it had also handed over a “further response to the subpoena regarding the Richmond Field Office's Domain Perspective.”\n\nJordan’s letter to the FBI in late February that the bureau had refused for two years to provide adequate answers on the FBI’s Richmond Field Office’s January 2023 memo, which linked “racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists” (RMVEs) with a “radical-traditionalist Catholic” (RTC) ideology.\n\nThe Republican chairman argued that “the Richmond memorandum resulted in federal law enforcement agents being inserted into places of worship.” Jordan said that the FBI under Wray “failed to produce information regarding open-sources, FBI case files, and liaison and local law enforcement reporting used to create the Richmond memorandum – all of which were responsive to the Committee’s subpoena.”\n\nThe FBI intelligence product released in January 2023 by the bureau’s field office in Richmond contended that links between RMVEs and RTCs “almost certainly presents opportunities for threat mitigation through the exploration of new avenues for tripwires and source development.”\n\nBut the FBI’s national press office admitted in February 2023 that “this particular field office product…does not meet the exacting standards of the FBI” and claimed that “upon learning of the document, FBI Headquarters quickly began taking action to remove the document from FBI systems and conduct a review of the basis for the document.”\n\nThe field office’s intelligence product repeatedly cited the left-wing Southern Poverty Law Center, including an article on “Radical Traditional Catholicism.”\n\nThe Richmond field office also pointed to an Atlantic article on “How Extremist Gun Culture is Trying to Co-Opt the Rosary.” And the local field office had also cited articles by Salon, including “Traditional Catholics and White Nationalist ‘Groypers’ Forge a New Far-Right Youth Movement” and “White Nationalists Get Religion.”\n\nDOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz wrote in 2024 that the FBI’s Inspection Division concluded that “there was no evidence of malicious intent or improper purpose” behind the local field office memo, but did note significant problems with it, including that it \"failed to adhere to analytic tradecraft standards and evinced errors in professional judgment, including that it lacked sufficient evidence or articulable support for a relationship between RMVEs and so-called RTC ideology; incorrectly conflated the subjects’ religious views with their RMVE activities, creating the appearance that the FBI had inappropriately considered religious beliefs and affiliation as a basis for conducting investigative activity; and reflected a lack of training and awareness concerning proper domestic terrorism terminology.”\n\nThe FBI also told Jordan on Friday that it was handing over “information regarding investigations related to the FACE Act.”\n\nThe bureau said that, since May 2022, “the FBI's counterterrorism and criminal divisions have investigated 55 acts that led to FACE Act-predicated investigations.” The bureau said that one investigation “involved a facility that provides abortion services, 31 involved a facility that provides pregnancy resources, and 23 involved a facility that provides both abortion services and pregnancy resources.”\n\nJordan’s late February letter had alleged that, under the Biden administration, “the FBI and the Justice Department implemented a double standard in enforcing the FACE Act in a way that protected anti-life activists and facilities while effectively ignoring attacks on pro-life advocates and facilities.”\n\nHe also said Wray’s FBI “utilized aggressive law enforcement tactics to go after pro-life advocates that bordered on thuggish” as he demanded more information from the bureau.\n\nThen-FBI Director Wray testified in August 2022 that the bureau had launched “domestic violent extremism investigations” into pro-abortion rights threats and attacks that increasingly targeted anti-abortion groups in the wake of the May 2022 leak of a draft of the Supreme Court’s opinion overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nPresident Donald Trump in January pardoned 23 pro-life activists who were convicted under the FACE Act.\n\nPatel and the FBI handed over an initial tranche of documents in response to Jordan’s subpoena earlier in March, as first reported by Fox News, with those records reportedly relating to Garland’s school board memo, the failed investigation into pipe bombs planted in the nation’s capital the day before the January 6th riot, the bureau's interactions with social media companies, and the now-defunct Foreign Influence Task Force.\n\n“Kash Patel’s FBI was given a mandate to open up the books and engage in transparency efforts at levels never before seen – and our Congressional Affairs team is stepping up to the plate,” FBI spokesman Ben Williamson told Just the News. “We will continue to work diligently with Chairman Jordan and Chairman Grassley to ensure the American people get the information they deserve.”",

The judge also blocked Citibank, which holds the money on behalf of EPA, from transferring it to the government or anyone else.\n\nEPA Administrator Lee Zeldin claimed the grant recipients engaged in mismanagement, fraud and self-dealing in announcing that he froze and moved to terminate the grants, but the judge said Zeldin's allegations were inadequate.\n\n\"At this juncture, EPA Defendants have not sufficiently explained why unilaterally terminating Plaintiffs’ grant awards was a rational precursor to reviewing\" the green bank program, Chutkan wrote.\n\nEPA TERMINATES BIDEN ADMIN'S GREEN GRANTS WORTH $20B, ZELDIN SAYS\n\nThe grant recipients sued the EPA, Zeldin and Citibank, arguing that they had illegally denied the groups access to $14 billion awarded last year through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, commonly referred to as a \"green bank.\" The program, which consisted of two initiatives worth $14 billion and $6 billion, respectively, was approved by Congress under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act to support clean energy and climate-friendly projects.\n\nThree groups — Climate United, the Coalition for Green Capital and Power Forward Communities — said the frozen grants prevented them from funding new projects and might force them to lay off staff. The groups said the allegations of mishandling funds were meritless.\n\nThe groups also asked Chutkan to order Citibank to unfreeze the account, but the judge declined.

        "full_text": "ANGOLA, La. (AP) — Louisiana used nitrogen gas to put a man to death Tuesday evening for a killing decades ago, marking the first time the state has used the method as it resumed executions after a 15-year hiatus.\n\nJessie Hoffman Jr., 46, was pronounced dead at 6:50 p.m. at the Louisiana State Penitentiary, authorities said, adding the nitrogen gas had flowed for 19 minutes during what one official characterized as a “flawless” execution.\n\nWitnesses to the execution said Hoffman appeared to involuntarily shake or had “some convulsive activity.” But the three witnesses who spoke — including two members of the media — agreed that, based on the protocol and what they learned about the execution method, nothing seemed out of the ordinary.\n\nWitness Gina Swanson, a reporter with WDSU, described the execution from her viewpoint as “clinical” and “procedural.” She said there was nothing that occurred during the process that made her think, “Was that right? Was that how it was supposed to go?”\n\nHoffman declined to make a final statement in the execution chamber. He also declined a final meal.\n\nIt was the fifth time nitrogen gas was used in the U.S. after four executions by the same method — all in Alabama. Three other executions, by lethal injection, are scheduled this week — in Arizona on Wednesday and in Florida and Oklahoma on Thursday.\n\nHoffman convicted of New Orleans murder\n\nHoffman was convicted of the murder of Mary “Molly” Elliott, a 28-year-old advertising executive who was killed in New Orleans. At the time of the crime, Hoffman was 18 and has since spent much of his adult life at the penitentiary in rural southeast Louisiana, where he was executed Tuesday evening.\n\nAfter court battles earlier this month, attorneys for Hoffman had turned to the Supreme Court in last-ditch hopes of halting the execution. Last year, the court declined to intervene in the nation’s first nitrogen hypoxia execution, in Alabama.\n\nHoffman’s lawyers had unsuccessfully argued that the nitrogen gas procedure — which deprives a person of oxygen — violates the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. The man’s lawyers, in a last-ditch appeal, also argued the method would infringe on Hoffman’s freedom to practice religion, specifically his Buddhist breathing and meditation in the moments leading up to death.\n\nLouisiana officials maintained the method is painless. They also said it was past time for the state to deliver justice as promised to victims’ families after a decade and a half hiatus — one brought on partly by an inability to secure lethal injection drugs.\n\nThe Supreme Court voted 5-4 in declining to step in.\n\nHours earlier at a hearing Tuesday, a 19th Judicial District Court Judge Richard “Chip” Moore also declined to stop the execution. He agreed with the state’s lawyers who had argued the man’s religion-based arguments fell under the jurisdiction of a federal judge who had already ruled on them, according to local news outlets.\n\nExecution method deprives body of oxygen\n\nUnder the Louisiana protocol, which is nearly identical to Alabama’s, officials had earlier said Hoffman would be strapped to a gurney before a full-face respirator mask fitted tightly on him. Pure nitrogen gas was then pumped into the mask, forcing him to breathe it in and depriving him of the oxygen needed to maintain bodily functions.\n\nThe protocol called for the gas to be administered for at least 15 minutes or five minutes after the inmate’s heart rate reaches a flatline indication on the EKG, whichever is longer.\n\nTwo media witnesses to Tuesday’s execution said Hoffman was covered with a gray plush blanket from the neck down. In the chamber with Hoffman was his spiritual adviser. Ahead of the execution and after the curtains closed to the viewing room, witnesses said they could hear Buddhist chanting.\n\nThe gas began to flow at 6:21 p.m. and Hoffman started twitching, media witnesses said. His hands clenched and he had a “slight head movement.” Swanson said she closely watched the blanket over Hoffman’s chest area and could see it rise and fall, indicating that he was breathing. She said his last visible breath appeared to be at 6:37 p.m. Shortly after, the curtains between the chamber and witness viewing room closed. When they reopened, Hoffman was pronounced dead.\n\nSeth Smith, chief of operations at the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections, witnessed the execution and also acknowledged Hoffman’s movements. Smith, who has a medical background, said he perceived the convulsions to be an “involuntary response to dying” and that Hoffman appeared to be unconscious at the time.\n\nNitrogen gas was first used in Alabama\n\nEach inmate put to death using nitrogen in Alabama had appeared to shake and gasp to varying degrees during their executions, according to media witnesses, including an Associated Press reporter. Alabama state officials said the reactions were involuntary movements associated with oxygen deprivation.\n\nAlabama first used nitrogen gas to put Kenneth Eugene Smith to death last year, marking the first time a new method had been used in the U.S. since lethal injection was introduced in 1982.\n\nAlabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma specifically authorize execution by nitrogen hypoxia, according to records compiled by the Death Penalty Information Center. Arkansas was added to the list on Tuesday.\n\nSeeking to resume executions, Louisiana’s GOP-dominated Legislature expanded the state’s approved death penalty methods last year to include nitrogen hypoxia and electrocution. Lethal injection was already in place.\n\nOn Tuesday, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed legislation allowing executions using nitrogen gas, making hers the fifth state to adopt the method. Arkansas currently has 25 people on death row.\n\nOver recent decades, the number of executions nationally has declined sharply amid legal battles, a shortage of lethal injection drugs and waning public support for capital punishment. That has led a majority of states to either abolish or pause carrying out the death penalty.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, a small group of execution opponents held a vigil outside the rural southeast Louisiana prison at Angola, where the state’s executions are carried out. Some passed out prayer cards with photos of a smiling Hoffman and planned a Buddhist reading and “Meditation for Peace.”\n\nLouisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said she expects at least four people to be executed this year in the state. Following Hoffman’s execution, she said justice had been delayed for far too long and now Hoffman ”faces the ultimate judgment, the judgment before God.”",

        "full_text": "The Trump administration has admitted in federal court documents that “many” Venezuelans it accused of being dangerous gang members and deported through presidential wartime powers have no criminal records in the United States, but argued it was only because they had only been in the U.S. briefly.\n\nPresident Donald Trump used a centuries-old law, the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, to deport the Venezuelans without due process in the U.S., saying they were members of the feared Tren de Aragua gang.\n\n“The lack of criminal records does not indicate they pose a limited threat. In fact, based upon their association with Tren de Aragua, the lack of specific information about each specific individual actually highlights the risk they pose,” said Robert Cerna, a top Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, in a sworn statement filed Monday night to a the U.S. District Court in Washington D.C.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump sent these Venezuelans to El Salvador mega prison. Their families deny gang ties.\n\nCerna’s statement and other court documents offer critical insight into how the federal government justifies which Venezuelans to send to a mega prison in El Salvador as part of a deal the Trump administration brokered with President Nayib Bukele last month. Bukele said they would remain in prison for at least a year.\n\nThe move has ignited widespread alarm over the extent of Trump’s executive authority and due process violations. The White House has argued that the deportations were justified in the name of public safety.\n\nCerna’s statement is part of a lawsuit challenging an executive order in which Trump directed his administration to use the wartime powers to deport Venezuelan citizens over 14 years old if they are Tren de Aragua members. Cerna is the Acting Field Office Director of Enforcement and Removal Operations for ICE in Harlingen, Texas.\n\nOver the weekend, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., ordered the deportations blocked, telling the administration during a hearing to bring back any planes already in the air carrying deportees. The Trump administration sent more than 200 Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador anyway, raising questions about whether the White House violated the court ruling. The Justice Department has denied the government defied U.S. District Judge James Boasberg’s written orders.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump deports hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members. Did he defy a court order?\n\nCerna said the lack of information the government has on the deported Venezuelans “demonstrates that they are terrorists with regard to whom we lack a complete file.” Neither Cerna nor the federal government has released any evidence publicly on the criminal and personal history of the deported Venezuelans. The ICE official described how the agency had determined their personal and criminal backgrounds and shared details of charges, arrests, and convictions without identifying specific people.\n\nHe indicated that ICE databases showed that “numerous” individuals had been arrested during federal gang operations or had criminal histories in the U.S. That includes allegations of murder for one individual as well as arrests and charges for aggravated assault with a weapon, drug possession, and sex crimes. He also said several of the individuals had been under investigation for kidnapping, drug trafficking, murder, and other serious crimes in Venezuela and elsewhere.\n\nICE “carefully vetted” the individuals through court records, surveillance, law enforcement encounters, interviews, victim testimonies, criminal evidence members, financial transactions, computer checks, and confessions of membership, Cerna said. He said the agency did not rely solely on social media, photos of gang gestures and tattoos to link people to the Tren de Aragua gang.\n\nU.S. authorities have linked some tattoos to Tren de Aragua, but experts say that Tren de Aragua members don’t have any specific tattoos tied to affiliation.\n\nAttorneys and immigration advocates say that the invocation of the Alien Enemies Act is unlawful and that the Venezuelans were entitled to due process and the opportunity to show a judge that they do not belong to Tren de Aragua.\n\nFamilies of three men who appear to have been deported and imprisoned in El Salvador told the Miami Herald that their relatives have no gang affiliation – and two said their relatives had never been charged with a crime in the U.S. or elsewhere. One has been previously accused by the U.S. government of ties to the Tren de Aragua gang, but his family denies any connection.\n\nHeated court proceedings\n\nOn Monday Judge Boasberg asked the administration for more details about the deportation flights during a hearing on Monday. The Justice Department did not answer questions, citing national security.\n\nCerna claimed in another sworn statement that the passengers on a third flight to El Salvador had final orders of removal and had not been solely deported under the wartime authority.\n\nREAD MORE: Judge orders DOJ lawyers to justify secrecy around El Salvador deportations: reports\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump called Boesberg “a radical left lunatic of a judge, a troublemaker, and an agitator” on social media. He called for the long-time federal judge’s impeachment, prompting an extraordinary admonishment from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nIn a statement, the chief justice said that “for more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.” Roberts, who was appointed to the high court by President George W. Bush, said “the normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.”\n\nLawyers and experts have warned that Trump’s public lashing of Boesberg and his potential defiance of the court order constitute an attack on checks and balances, a key tenet of American democracy that keeps the three branches of government accountable to each other.\n\n“The Trump administration’s decisions this weekend are part and parcel of a campaign of mass deportation and evisceration of rule of law,” said Hannah Flamm, an attorney and acting senior policy director at the International Refugee Assistance Project, a New York-based legal aid and advocacy group.\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act has only been used three times before, all during times of war. The last time it was used led to the internment of Japanese immigrants and Americans of Japanese descent in U.S. camps during World War II.\n\nThis story was originally published March 18, 2025 at 7:52 PM.",

        "full_text": "Mark Rober is perhaps the most successful science and engineering YouTube creator.\n\nHe has 65 million subscribers — more than Taylor Swift — and many of his videos have over 120 million views, surpassing the most recent Super Bowl.\n\nRober’s most recent release compares a Tesla dealing with various road issues with a test car with a Luminar LIDAR. He tests how both cars react to a dummy child in the road obscured by fog, water jets, bright lights and even a giant printed poster showing an empty road, as sometimes seen in the Road Runner cartoons.\n\nThe goal of the test is to compare the performance of the Tesla, which uses only cameras and computer vision, and the LIDAR based system, which uses an advanced scanning laser to create a 3-D view of the road ahead of the car. All working self-driving car systems operating on roads without a human supervisor use LIDAR, radar, cameras, vision, and sometimes more. Tesla, and some startups, are trying to work with just vision.\n\nSadly, Rober’s large effort here is almost entirely wasted, because while the title of the video says it is a “self-driving car” test, he uses an un-named version of Tesla’s “Autopilot” system, which is its older freeway driver-assist tool.\n\nIt is odd to find myself so critical. My 2013 “Cameras vs. Lasers” article, while getting long in the tooth, was one of the pioneering articles on this question, and I’ve always come down pretty strongly on the LIDAR side, and I’ve been a very frequent critic of Tesla’s decision to use only vision. Rober had a great chance to show the reality of this, but dropped the ball.\n\nNobody ever considered Autopilot to be a self-driving system. It is more like a fancy cruise control and it frequently makes mistakes and needs a driver attentive to the road with hands on the wheel to keep it safe. Tesla moved beyond that system several years ago and now markets a system called “supervised full self driving.”\n\nIn spite of that seemingly explicit name, it also is not a self-driving system and needs supervision, though Tesla has for many years claimed it would become a self-driving system “next year,” without success. Most recently, it was announced it would operate unsupervised in June in Austin, Texas, though few believe this promise will be delivered on in a meaningful way.\n\nNonetheless, the new FSD system, which only works on Tesla’s latest hardware, found in cars released starting in 2023, is significantly different from the old FSD system. And that is quite different from the old Autopilot, too.\n\nThe newer Autopilot is derived from the FSD system, but still fairly different. Frankly, few are interested in tests on the old Autopilot, so that makes Rober’s tests fairly meaningless, even if it is the case that the newest FSD system would have made the same errors — we unfortunately don’t know.\n\nWhile Rober may not have known about the software versions available for his car, the crew at Luminar, the LIDAR company that assisted with the tests, provided the LIDAR car and system. As it has done these tests before, the company would surely have been aware of them and should have informed Rober.\n\nThe tests performed were designed to highlight the difference between computer vision and LIDAR. The LIDAR car performed them all, while the Autopilot system failed in thick fog, very heavy water jets and the Road Runner cartoon-like photographic wall. The Tesla also failed with Autopilot off, leaving just its forward collision avoidance system. The FCA system is designed to delay braking to give the driver a chance to brake first, as such it stopped too late.\n\nUpdate: Online critics have pointed out a number of concerning inconsistencies in the video and a “raw” clip provided by Rober. Further, it seems that the appearance of the cartoon pattern in the brick wallpaper before he hits it indicates it was hit before and reconstructed for the the take which was shown. They are also pointing out Rober seems to disengage the Autopilot system a short time before hitting the wall. While he should have taken steps to avoid that, it doesn’t alter the result of the test much, as the system, if it had detected the wall, should have been braking long before his disengagement. At most the disengagement modestly increased the speed of hitting the wall.\n\nWhat’s a good test?\n\nAnother problem with Rober’s tests is that the ones where the vision system failed do not model the real world well. While all teams test their vehicles in fog and rain and in the face of bright lights, they generally do not demand success for conditions which do not appear in the real world, and which a human could not handle. They do test these to see how they could improve the systems, but real testing of self-driving cars involves millions of miles and a very broad array of challenges on which the system is hoped to surpass human performance.\n\nThe fake wall was a billboard sized canvas printed with a photograph of the empty road beyond the wall. Those are rarely seen in the wild outside of certain regions of New Mexico. Self-driving teams are interested in potential adversarial attacks on cars and how to defend against them, but this is not a likely one; there are simpler and cheaper techniques. It’s more in line with the fun that Rober’s viewers enjoy in his videos than a real test. A visual image is of course something that will foil cameras and not adversely affect radars or LIDARs.\n\nAll successful self-driving teams, who have managed to deploy a vehicle with no human inside, use a combination of cameras, radars and LIDAR.\n\nThe vision only approach is used only by Tesla and some smaller startups, and none have made a working self-driving car, or even come close to it, as of yet, though they have hope for the future. Indeed, most experts think that approach may well work in the future, but just when is unknown. For now, they feel that making use of all sensors is important to get the vehicles working, and later work can be done to make things cheaper, including going to just vision if and when that becomes practical.\n\nAs such, a demonstration of the abilities of LIDAR and the problems vision can have makes sense. Tesla’s latest FSD probably would have failed some of these tests, but it was not tested so Rober’s video leaves us without the information we actually might seek. Rober has not, as yet, responded to a request for more information.\n\nThe problems shown are not the most important and difficult problems for computer vision to solve, however. It’s biggest problem is attaining the extremely high reliability level needed to bet your life, not specific hazards like fog or rain or clever coyotes.\n\nThe Luminar LIDAR performs well. Some LIDARS might have issues with some of the challenges presented, including opaque fog and extremely heavy rain. None would have an issue with the photograph wall. Luminar’s LIDAR uses long-wave infrared, which allows much more power and range. Waymo has a similar instrument of their own construction on their vehicles. (I worked in a minor way with the team which developed it.)\n\nWe might hope Rober would re-do his test with Tesla’s latest software and hardware, and also come up with more real-world situations to tell the real story.",

        "full_text": "A federal judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked the U.S. military from enforcing President Donald Trump's executive order barring transgender people from military service while a lawsuit by 20 current and would-be service members challenging the measure goes forward.\n\nU.S. District Judge Ana Reyes in Washington found that Trump's January 27 order, one of a several issued by the Republican president impacting legal rights for transgender Americans, likely violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition on sex discrimination.\n\nReyes was appointed by President Joe Biden, Trump's Democrat predecessor.\n\nIn response to Trump's order, the military said on Feb. 11 that it would no longer allow transgender individuals to join the military and would stop performing or facilitating procedures associated with gender transition for service members. Later that month, the military said it would begin expelling transgender members.\n\nTrump said in his order that \"adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual's sex conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life.\"\n\nTrump issued a similar order during his first term, during which already-serving transgender members were allowed to remain.\n\nPlaintiffs in the lawsuit argued that the order was illegal, pointing to a 2020 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that employment discrimination against transgender people is a form of illegal sex discrimination.\n\nLawyers for the government have argued in court that the military is entitled to bar people with certain conditions that make them unsuitable for service, also including bipolar disorder and eating disorders. At a March 12 hearing, they told Reyes that she should defer to the judgment of the current administration that transgender people are not fit for service.\n\nThe judge repeatedly pressed them to justify their stance with evidence, and at times expressed open outrage at the order's language denigrating the character of transgender people.\n\nThe military has about 1.3 million active-duty personnel, Department of Defense data shows. While transgender rights advocates say there are as many as 15,000 transgender service members, officials say the number is in the low thousands.",

        "full_text": "The Supreme Court in a 5-4 vote declined to stop Louisiana from carrying out its first execution in 15 years later Tuesday with Justice Neil Gorsuch joining the court’s three liberal justices in agreeing to delay it.\n\nJessie Hoffman, 46, is set to be executed for the 1996 kidnapping, rape and murder of Molly Elliott, making Louisiana the second state to carry out an execution by nitrogen gas. The Supreme Court has also declined to step in since Alabama began employing the method last year.\n\nFive of the court’s conservatives — Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — refused Hoffman’s final appeal to delay his execution without comment.\n\nThe three liberal justices dissented in that decision, joined by Gorsuch, President Trump’s first appointee to the court.\n\nThough the liberal justices did not explain their reasoning, Gorsuch in a written dissent said he would’ve sent the case back to a lower court for another look at Hoffman’s claims that Louisiana’s nitrogen hypoxia method substantially burdens his right to practice his Buddhist faith under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) of 2000.\n\nHoffman noted in his application that meditative breathing at the time of death carries profound spiritual significance in the Buddhist tradition. Gorsuch said a lower court was wrong to make its own finding “about the kind of breathing Mr. Hoffman’s faith requires” in rejecting his claims.\n\n“The Court of Appeals failed to confront the district court’s apparent legal error — or even to mention the RLUIPA claim Mr. Hoffman pressed on appeal. Perhaps that claim ultimately lacks merit. But the Fifth Circuit’s unexplained omission leaves this Court poorly positioned to assess it,” Gorsuch wrote.\n\nThe Supreme Court rarely intervenes on an emergency basis to stop executions, having already denied several requests since the start of the year.\n\nIn court filings, the Louisiana attorney general’s office insisted Hoffman had improperly waited until the last minute to file the appeal and the state wasn’t violating his protected rights.\n\n“Plaintiff has never argued that there is a legally appreciable difference between his breathing as he fades into unconsciousness by nitrogen hypoxia and his breathing as he would fade into unconsciousness after being shot by a firing squad,” the state attorney general’s office wrote in court filings.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc.

        "full_text": "A French politician facetiously asked the U.S. to return the Statue of Liberty, suggesting the country no longer lives up to the values the green-hued gift represents.\n\nRaphaël Glucksmann, a member of the European Parliament with the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, said at a party convention on Sunday that he had a message \"to the Americans who have chosen to side with the tyrants … who fired researchers for demanding scientific freedom.\"\n\n\"Give us back the Statue of Liberty,\" he said with a smile as the crowd cheered. \"We gave it to you as a gift, but apparently you despise it. So it will be just fine here at home.\"\n\nLady Liberty — full name \"Liberty Enlightening the World\" — was conceptualized by French anti-slavery activist Édouard de Laboulaye in 1865 to honor the centennial of the U.S. Declaration of Independence and its friendship with France, whose support helped win the American Revolution.\n\nAfter years of construction, shipping and assembly, the statue was officially unveiled in 1886 in New York Harbor, where its raised torch and inscribed words of welcome greeted the millions of immigrants who arrived at Ellis Island in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nIt has endured as a global symbol of freedom, patriotism and democracy — and the lack thereof — in the decades since.\n\n\"Ordinary people, from American suffragists in the 1800s and 1900s to Chinese students in the 1980s, have raised up the Statue's likeness to call for greater equality, an end to injustice, and more enlightened societies,\" says the National Park Service (NPS), which maintains the site.\n\nGlucksmann's comments come at a time when the U.S. has been criticized at home and abroad for abandoning some of those commitments, including by cracking down on immigration and alienating European allies. Glucksmann has been a vocal critic of President Trump's decision to temporarily suspend aid to Ukraine as it defends itself from Russia.\n\nWhen asked about Glucksmann's request — which he has since confirmed was symbolic — at a Monday briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"And my advice to that unnamed, low-level French politician would be to remind them that it's only because of the United States of America that the French are not speaking German right now, so they should be very grateful to our great country,\" Leavitt added — an apparent reference to the U.S. role, alongside other allied nations, in liberating France from Nazi occupation in World War II.\n\nNo one is actually taking the statue back\n\nGlucksmann responded in a 10-part thread on X addressed to the American people, acknowledging, \"I would simply not be here if hundreds of thousands of young Americans had not landed on our beaches in Normandy.\"\n\nBut, he said, that was a different version of America — one that \"fought against tyrants, it did not flatter them;\" one that \"welcomed the persecuted and didn't target them.\"\n\n\"It was far, so far from what your current President does, says, and embodies,\" he wrote.\n\nHe specifically cited the Trump administration's \"betrayal of Ukraine and Europe,\" as well as its treatment of scientists. Notably: One French university recently launched an initiative to welcome American scientists whose work is untenable due to the administration's research cuts.\n\nGlucksmann said his comments were meant as \"a wake up call.\"\n\n\"No one, of course, will come and steal the Statue of Liberty,\" he wrote. \"The statue is yours. But what it embodies belongs to everyone. And if the free world no longer interests your government, then we will take up the torch, here in Europe.\"\n\nThe Statue of Liberty would be hard for France to recall, since it is owned by the U.S. government, according to UNESCO. It's also a national monument and major tourist attraction, drawing 3 million visitors in 2023 alone.\n\nThe U.S. had to work for the gift\n\nWhile the Statue of Liberty was a gift, its creators believed the project should be a joint effort: The French paid for the statue, while the U.S. paid for its pedestal.\n\nThat involved a massive fundraising effort in both countries, through advertising, public events and souvenir sales.\n\n\"Though wealthy individuals did contribute, it was the small donations of hundreds of thousands of working people and children on both sides of the Atlantic that made the Statue of Liberty a reality,\" the NPS says.\n\nFrench sculptor Frédéric-Auguste Bartholdi led the design and construction of the statue's copper components — from crown to gown — over several years, while working with American architect Richard Morris Hunt to design the 154-foot pedestal.\n\nThe 151-foot statue was assembled in France by 1884 and presented to the U.S. minister to France that same year. Then came the challenge of actually bringing it stateside.\n\nBartholdi had selected Bedloe's Island — now called Liberty Island — in New York as the site for the statue, since it was visible to every ship entering New York Harbor. But to get there, the statue had to be disassembled into 350 pieces, transported on a French navy ship and reassembled — by a construction crew largely made up of new immigrants, according to the NPS.\n\nThe statue was finally unveiled on a rainy day in October 1886, as 1 million New Yorkers watched and cheered.\n\n\"When it was time for Bartholdi to release the tricolor French flag that veiled Liberty's face, a roar of guns, whistles, and applause sounded,\" the NPS says.\n\nA bronze plaque inscribed with \"The New Colossus\" — a poem by Jewish-American poet and activist Emma Lazarus — was added to the pedestal in 1903, memorializing the famous phrase: \"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\"\n\nThe statue's symbolism and likeness have stretched far beyond New York in the years since. Replicas can be found around the world, and have even been traded by the U.S. and France.\n\nFrench people living in the U.S. sent a replica to their homeland in 1889 for the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. The statue was placed on an artificial island in the River Seine in Paris, originally facing the French presidential palace. It turned to face its American sister in New York in 1937.",

But then the bank got to the point.\n\n“We know this is a difficult time, and we’re here to help,” the bank wrote. “We received a request from Social Security Administration to return benefits paid to LEONARD A. JOHNSON’s account after their passing.”\n\n“There’s nothing you need to do — we’ve deducted the funds from LEONARD A. JOHNSON’s account.”\n\nUh oh. It itemized how $5,201 had been stricken from their bank account, on the grounds that Ned wasn’t justified to get those benefits — because he was dead. That was for payments he’d received in December and January.\n\nNed found that his February Social Security check hadn’t been paid, and he’s yet to receive his March check, either. His Medicare insurance had been canceled. He also learned that when you die, your credit score gets marked as “deceased, do not issue credit,” which makes it tough to get a loan.\n\n“The good news is I don’t think it can go any lower than that,” he said cheerfully.\n\nHe called the bank first, and they said an electronic notification had been triggered on Feb. 18 that he had died back in November. But I’m on the phone with you right now, he told them. Also, what did I die of? Take it up with Social Security, they said.\n\nWhat followed was a nearly three-week battle to resurrect himself. He called Social Security two or three times a day for two weeks, with each call put on hold and then eventually disconnected. Finally someone answered and gave him an appointment for March 13. Then he got a call delaying that to March 24.\n\nIn a huff, he went to the office on the ninth floor of the Henry Jackson Federal Building downtown. It’s one of the buildings proposed to be closed under what the AP called “a frenetic and error-riddled push by Elon Musk’s budget-cutting advisers.”\n\nIt was like a Depression-era scene, he said, with a queue 50-deep jockeying for the attentions of two tellers. The employees were kind but beleaguered.\n\n“They are so understaffed down there,” he said. “They think the office is about to be closed down, and they don’t know where they’re going to go. It feels like the agency’s being gutted.”\n\nAfter waiting for four hours, Johnson admits he jumped the line: “I saw an opening and I kind of rushed up and told them I was listed as dead. That seemed to get their attention.”\n\nOnce in front of a human, Johnson said he was able to quickly prove he was alive, using his passport and his gift of gab. They pledged to fix his predicament, and on Thursday this past week, the bank called to say it had returned the deducted deposits to his account. As of Friday morning he hadn’t received February or March’s benefits payments.\n\n“When I was in that line, I was thinking that if I was living solely off Social Security, I could be close to dumpster diving about now,” he said.\n\nWhat’s concerning is that no one has been able to tell him how he ended up in the agency’s “death master file.” Had he been conflated with some other poor Leonard Johnson? Was he flagged as dead by a credit agency or the electronic funds transfer system, which then ricocheted back to Social Security? Was it simple input error? Nobody knows. Or nobody’s saying.\n\nSocial Security blandly labels this sort of event an “erroneous death determination.”\n\nJohnson said his takeaway is that Social Security needs help — with its databases, but especially with enough staffing to answer the phones. The announced plan from the new administration is to cut 7,000 employees. This past week, the news outlet ProPublica reported on a recording of a meeting in which the director, a Trump appointee, suggested ominously that DOGE’s suggested changes could cause the agency to collapse.\n\nThe director also debunked the idea that dead people are being used to fraudulently claim benefits in any widespread manner — as both Musk and Trump keep claiming.\n\nThere are 110-year-old and older people in one of databases, the director said, but those people are “not in pay status — they’re not actually being paid benefits. These are records we never bothered with.”\n\nFor his part, Johnson says he felt the agency was super-aggressive in the opposite direction. Money was unilaterally deducted from his bank account before he even had a chance to react to the news of his untimely death. People living check to check could be decimated, he said.\n\n“I’m OK with mistakes being made,” he said. “But I’m not sure how much they’re focused on fixing these kinds of mistakes going forward, as they are in using the mistakes to tear the place down.”\n\nSaid his wife Pam: “You sort of have no choice but to laugh it off. But it seems like it’s going to get worse.”\n\nFor now, Ned Johnson is hopeful he has a new lease on life. But does he?\n\nAgents cautioned him that once you’re tagged as dead in the electronic morgue, it floats in the ether and can haunt you again. It’s like there’s a ghost in the machine.\n\nSure enough, after I met Johnson on Friday and verified he was a live human being, I went home and Googled him. One of those people-search sites popped up with a listing at his address.\n\n“Leonard A. Johnson, Seattle, WA,” it read. “Deceased.”\n\nThe opinions expressed in reader comments are those of the author only and do not reflect the opinions of The Seattle Times.",

        "full_text": "D.C.\n\nThe women behind The Conservateur. Photo collage: Courtesy of The Conservateur\n\nThe Conservateur — a D.C.-based lifestyle site that positions itself as the Vogue for conservatives — is part of a new wave of young women carving out their own lanes in right-wing media.\n\nWhy it matters: The conservative media world has traditionally been dominated by the Roger Aileses and Rush Limbaughs of the world — or, simply put, older dudes. And now that's changing.\n\nThe big picture: Young people are veering further right, a trend that helped get President Trump back into the Executive Manse and is being fueled in part by Gen Z-coded, conservative-leaning influencers and platforms.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump performed slightly better with women in this election than he did in 2020.\n\nState of play: The Conserveatur gained over 40,000 Instagram followers in the three days following Trump's election, says Jayme Franklin, a Fox News and Trump White House alum who co-founded the site and runs it alongside three other women.\n\nThe site bills itself as a lifestyle platform, not a news outlet: Articles include tips on how to decorate for Christmas like a First Lady, a piece on Lara Trump's new fitness line, profiles of White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Fox News host Ainsley Earhardt, and a behind-the-scenes look at Cooper's Nashville wedding.\n\nBy the numbers: The Conservateur saw 1.7 million page views last year, says Franklin, and the women fund it themselves, bringing in revenue from subscriptions and by selling merch.\n\nAnd, of course, there's a little lib-owning: One meme shared on the platform's Instagram shows Barron Trump holding his hand up to his ear with overlaid text reading, \"When I refresh ICE's live deportation tracker.\"\n\nHow it started: Franklin and her co-founder, Isabelle Redfield, launched the Conservateur in 2020 as an antidote to what they saw as the overt wokeism within traditional mags like Marie Claire or Cosmopolitan.\n\nWhat they're saying: After Trump claimed the popular vote last year, it's now no longer \"taboo\" to be considered a conservative, says Downey: \"You couldn't really question the fact that more than half the country is now on board with this, and you can't say they're all crazy.\"\n\nThe intrigue: Franklin tells Axios several things have led to this vibe shift.\n\nFirst, libs lost cachet with former President Biden: \"The left had an opportunity in 2020 to really take advantage of culture, because [there] was a lot of energy there, especially with BLM and all that stuff,\" Franklin tells Axios. \"And then they put in this, to be quite frank, old man who just didn't inspire anyone.\"\n\nSecond, young people started to chafe against \"the progressive culture of policing everything,\" says Franklin. \"You're not allowed to say this, you can't make a joke, you'll be canceled.\"\n\nThird, some women got fed up with feminism. \"Growing up, you were sold this [narrative of] 'men are bad. Don't get married. Be your own woman. Be a career woman,''\" says Franklin.\n\nFourth, many wellness-loving women have found a gateway to the right through the MAHA movement, particularly moms concerned with their kids' food ingredients or vaccines.\n\nBetween the lines: The Conservateur's audience tends to be women ages 20-40 in left-ish metro areas who lean Christian and conservative, Franklin tells Axios. Sororities love them, too.\n\nZoom in: Things are already changing in largely liberal D.C. since Trump came back to town, says Franklin.\n\nWhat we're watching: A Conservateur podcast is in the works, say Downey and Franklin, and they'd love to feature women of the Trump administration who they believe won't get their due in mainstream media: Names floated include Kristi Noem, Pam Bondi and Linda McMahon.\n\nThe bottom line: \"We're a capitalist country at the end of the day, and capitalism caters to consumers,\" says Franklin of the tide shift. \"If Trump's the popular candidate, a lot of these brands are going to have to start catering.\"\n\nGet more local stories in your inbox with Axios Washington D.C..\n\nCopyright Axios Media, 2024",

        "full_text": "Claim:\n\nIn early March 2025, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs canceled a $56,000 contract intended for watering approximately eight plants over a five-year period.\n\nRating:\n\nMixture\n\nAbout this rating\n\nWhat's True\n\nThe VA did cancel a $56,000 contract for \"interior plant maintenance\" in early March 2025.\n\nWhat's False\n\nHowever, the contract covered 104 plants, not eight, and included weekly maintenance services beyond just watering.\n\nIn early March 2025, social media users shared a rumor that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs canceled a $56,000 contract for watering roughly eight plants for five years and that the Department of Government Efficiency would water these plants for free.\n\nThe claim spread on multiple social media platforms, including Facebook, Reddit and TikTok.\n\nA post on DOGE's official X account on March 6 sparked the rumor (archived). It read: \"The VA cancelled a $56,000 contract to water ~8 plants for 5 years. This is ~$1400/plant/year. The contract has been canceled and DOGE will water the plants free of charge.\"\n\nDOGE did not provide any further details or evidence regarding the number of plants covered or the specific services included in the contract. Its announcement came amid the VA's broader plan to terminate \"585 non-mission-critical or duplicative contracts.\"\n\nHowever, the claim that the VA canceled a $56,000 contract solely for watering roughly eight plants over five years is false. It is true that in early March 2025 the VA terminated a $56,000 contract for \"interior plant maintenance\"; however, it covered 104 plants and included weekly upkeep services such as pruning, cleaning and plant replacement, not just watering. Therefore, we have rated this claim as a mixture of true and false information.\n\nWhat we know about the plant maintenance contract\n\nPublicly available records on USASpending.gov — an official, open-to-the-public resource for tracking government spending — show that the VA did indeed award a contract worth up to $56,551 to Frontline Enterprises. The company, which says its aim is to provide employment opportunities to \"disabled veterans and their spouses,\" specializes in construction, facilities maintenance, janitorial services, landscaping and green cleaning.\n\nThe USASpending.gov database categorized the contract under \"interior plant maintenance\" but did not specify the exact services covered, the number of plants or the frequency of service. It only mentioned that the contract included utilities and housekeeping services and interior plantscaping.\n\nHowever, Frontline Enterprises said via LinkedIn message that the contract covered the weekly maintenance of 104 plants over a five-year period for a total cost of $56,000 (or $11,200 per year).\n\nThe company further explained that this amounted to $107.70 per plant each year or approximately $9 per plant each month for weekly upkeep. The services included watering, pruning, trimming, cleaning and dusting the foliage as well as maintaining proper soil levels, disease prevention and control, fertilization and plant replacement (except in cases of damage or loss beyond the company's control).\n\nSnopes has contacted the VA and Frontline Enterprises for further comment and will update this article if we receive a response.\n\nIn early March 2025, the USASpending.gov website indicated that $19,265 of the contract had already been spent. Exactly $33,370 was obligated under the contract, and the total potential award amount was $56,551.\n\nAt the time the previous link was archived, the current end date was listed as March 31, 2026, and the potential end date was March 31, 2028. However, as of March 13, the contract's current and potential end dates were both updated to March 6, 2025. This coincided with DOGE's post on X.\n\nNo other records in the USASpending.gov database matched the details of the contract shared by DOGE. However, between 2016 and 2019, Frontline Enterprises received a similar VA contract totaling $55,729 for plant maintenance services.\n\nPhotographs shared by DOGE\n\nFinally, DOGE included two photos in its post. The first showed an indoor setting with a wooden table positioned against a wall and two framed portraits hanging above it. There was a large, leafy plant on each side of the table. The second showed a close-up of a printed sign on the wooden table displaying pictures of various indoor plants and containing the text: \"Please do not water these plants. These plants are serviced by a plant contractor. Thank you. Buildings Management Division.\"\n\n(X account @DOGE)\n\nHowever, the origins of the pictures were unclear, including where and when they were taken. Reverse image searches on Google produced no evidence of them appearing online prior to DOGE's original post.",

The New York Times said it had spoken to five sources \"with knowledge of the events\" for its report but did not name them.\n\nNewsweek contacted the MSNBC press office for comment on Tuesday via email outside of regular office hours.\n\nThe Claim\n\nThe MSNBC News segment was posted on the network's official website with the title: \"Musk demoted! Go inside Trump's EXPLOSIVE, angry Cabinet meeting reported by NY Times.\"\n\nThe Facts\n\nAccording to the New York Times article, Musk clashed with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Secretary of State Marco Rubio over cuts DOGE had been imposing on their respective departments.\n\nDonald Trump created DOGE, which despite its name isn't an official government department but effectively an advisory body, following his second presidential inauguration on January 20. DOGE was placed under the command of Musk, a close Trump ally who has argued federal government spending needs to be radically cut back.\n\nSince its creation DOGE has overseen significant cuts including firing thousands of probationary workers from across the federal government, though this is facing legal challenges, and gutting the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).\n\nThe New York Times reported Duffy told Musk his DOGE team were trying to lay off air traffic controllers, which the billionaire business tycoon said was a \"lie.\" Musk then allegedly told Rubio he had fired \"nobody,\" to which the secretary of state replied that 1,500 State Department officials had accepted a buyout offer and asked if they should be rehired again so they could be fired.\n\nAccording to the newspaper, after the argument \"dragged on for an uncomfortable time\" Trump intervened to say Rubio had done a \"great job,\" and also praised Musk and other cabinet secretaries.\n\nIt continued: \"The president made clear he still supported the mission of the Musk initiative. But now was the time, he said, to be a bit more refined in its approach. From now on, he said, the secretaries would be in charge; the Musk team would only advise.\"\n\nNeither the New York Times article, nor Ari Melber's MSNBC broadcast, stated that Musk had been subject to any formal demotion.\n\nThe Ruling\n\nFalse.\n\nWhile the New York Times piece said DOGE had lost some of its power, and would from now on only provide spending advice to the various departmental secretaries, it did not at any point say Musk had received a formal demotion. Similarly, while MSNBC used the word \"demoted\" in the online title for Melber's segment, this word didn't feature in the broadcast itself.\n\nFACT CHECK BY Newsweek",

        "full_text": "Google is buying the cybersecurity firm Wiz for $32 billion — its biggest acquisition ever.\n\nIt's also the biggest deal of the year so far and a major test for Donald Trump's antitrust policy.\n\nA deal of this size could also supercharge more M&A following a slow few years.\n\nJust as 2025 was off to a slow start for M&A, Google announced its largest-ever acquisition.\n\nGoogle's parent company, Alphabet, and Wiz confirmed Tuesday that they had reached an agreement on the $32 billion all-cash deal.\n\nThe two companies were in talks last year for a $23 billion deal, but they fizzled out, and Wiz later said it would instead pursue an initial public offering.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said during a Tuesday briefing that the Wiz acquisition would boost its cloud security offering at a time when AI is bringing \"new risks\" and \"multi-cloud and hybrid are becoming the norm.\"\n\n\"Against this backdrop, organizations are looking for cybersecurity solutions that improve cloud security and span multiple clouds,\" he added.\n\nWiz, an Israeli-founded startup headquartered in New York, specializes in technology that scans everything companies put onto the cloud and identifies security risks. Under the agreement, Wiz's services would continue to be available through other cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, Thomas Kurian, Google Cloud's CEO, said in the Tuesday briefing.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi, Google's CFO, said the company expects the deal to close in 2026, subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nFor Google, the deal would give it the chance to show customers its cloud offerings — which trail behind those of Microsoft and Amazon — are as secure as can be. \"With Wiz, we believe we will vastly improve how security is designed, operated, and automated,\" Kurian added.\n\nHere's why the acquisition is a big deal for startup exits and a big test for the Trump administration.\n\nReturn of startup dealmaking?\n\nA deal of this size could catalyze more startup M&A activity following a sluggish few years.\n\nRelated stories\n\nLast year, there were 2,066 VC-backed startup M&A exits, worth $83.6 billion, according to PitchBook data. The first quarter of 2025 was off to a slower start, with 382 M&A deals worth $13.6 billion.\n\nAs the biggest deal of the year so far, Google's $32 billion purchase of Wiz has tipped the scales significantly, potentially pointing to more appetite for acquisitions as an exit route.\n\n\"Acquisitions allow startups to avoid the inherent volatility of public markets altogether and just focus on long-term growth and their daily operations,\" Mariam Pettit, the managing partner of Graph Theory Capital, told Business Insider, adding that an acquisition could deliver faster returns than an IPO.\n\nStartups have been gravitating toward secondary share sales and acquisitions in lieu of public listings for multiple reasons. The IPO process can be tough, requiring thorough auditing of a company's financials, potential restructurings, and regulatory compliance — as well as more intense quarterly scrutiny, Pettit said.\n\nThe US IPO market remained relatively dormant in 2024 despite high multiples and low volatility. PitchBook data showed that most VC-backed listings underperformed last year, with Instacart, Klaviyo, and Ibotta trading significantly lower relative to the Morningstar Growth Index.\n\nWiz's deal with Google would offer the company an avenue to bolster its growth, a person familiar with the process told BI, adding that the company surpassed $700 million in annual recurring revenue in the last quarter.\n\nA test for Trump's antitrust policy\n\nThe $32 billion acquisition could serve as a test of the regulatory environment under the Trump administration.\n\nWhile President Donald Trump was expected to usher in a more favorable M&A environment, Vice President JD Vance had previously voiced support for stricter dealmaking rules. Last year, he backed legislation to eliminate tax breaks for corporate mergers, signaling a stance closer to former FTC chair Lina Khan, who, under Biden, launched investigations into Microsoft and Amazon's businesses.\n\nAndrew Ferguson, Khan's replacement, said in February that the Trump administration would continue to use strict corporate merger guidelines adopted under Biden.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Google is facing two antitrust lawsuits, including one against its search business that was brought during Trump's first term.\n\nTwo recent Google mergers have come under close scrutiny by regulators but ultimately passed: its $2.1 billion acquisition of Fitbit in 2021 and its purchase of the cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion in 2022.\n\nEvelyn Mitchell-Wolf, an EMARKETER senior analyst, described the merger as a \"bold move\" in the current regulatory landscape.\n\n\"Given its price tag — and the fact that Google's already been found guilty of anticompetitive conduct in the search market — the acquisition will attract too much scrutiny to go through completely unimpeded,\" she said.",

        "full_text": "Chinese state media has welcomed Donald Trump's move to cut public funding for news outlets Voice of America and Radio Free Asia, which have long reported on authoritarian regimes.\n\nThe decision affects thousands of employees - some 1,300 staff have been put on paid leave at Voice Of America (VOA) alone since Friday's executive order.\n\nCritics have called the move a setback for democracy but Beijing's state newspaper Global Times denounced VOA for its \"appalling track record\" in reporting on China and said it has \"now been discarded by its own government like a dirty rag\".\n\nThe White House defended the move, saying it will \"ensure that taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda\".\n\nTrump's cuts target the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which is supported by Congress and funds the affected news outlets, such as VOA, Radio Free Asia (RFA) and Radio Free Europe.\n\nThey have won acclaim and international recognition for their reporting in places where press freedom is severely curtailed or non-existent, from China and Cambodia to Russia and North Korea.\n\nAlthough authorities in some of these countries block the broadcasts - VOA, for instance, is banned in China - people can listen to them on shortwave radio, or get around the restrictions via VPNs.\n\nRFA has often reported on the crackdown on human rights in Cambodia, whose former authoritarian ruler Hun Sen has hailed the cuts as a \"big contribution to eliminating fake news\".\n\nIt was also among the first news outlets to report on China's network of detention centres in Xinjiang, where the authorities are accused of locking up hundreds of thousands of Uyghur Muslims without trial. Beijing denies the claims, saying people willingly attend \"re-education camps\" which combat \"terrorism and religious extremism\". VOA's reporting on North Korean defectors and the Chinese Communist Party's alleged cover-up of Covid fatalities has won awards.\n\nVOA, primarily a radio outlet, which also broadcasts in Mandarin, was recognised last year for its podcast on rare protests in 2022 in China against Covid lockdowns.\n\nBut China's Global Times welcomed the cuts, calling VOA a \"lie factory\".\n\n\"As more Americans begin to break through their information cocoons and see a real world and a multi-dimensional China, the demonising narratives propagated by VOA will ultimately become a laughing stock,\" it said in an editorial published on Monday.\n\nHu Xijin, who was the Global Times' former editor-in-chief, wrote: \"Voice of America has been paralysed! And so has Radio Free Asia, which has been as vicious to China. This is such great news.\"\n\nSuch responses \"would have been easy to predict\", said Valdya Baraputri, a VOA journalist who lost her job over the weekend. She was previously employed by BBC World Service.\n\n\"Eliminating VOA, of course, allows channels that are the opposite of accurate and balanced reporting to thrive,\" she told the BBC.\n\nThe National Press Club, a leading representative group for US journalists, said the order \"undermines America's long-standing commitment to a free and independent press\".\n\nFounded during World War Two in part to counter Nazi propaganda, VOA reaches some 360 million people a week in nearly 50 languages. Over the years it has broadcast in China, North Korea, communist Cuba and the former Soviet Union. It's also been a helpful tool for many Chinese people to learn English.\n\nVOA's director Michael Abramowitz said Trump's order has hobbled VOA while \"America's adversaries, like Iran, China, and Russia, are sinking billions of dollars into creating false narratives to discredit the United States\".\n\nMs Baraputri, who is from Indonesia but based in Washington DC, first joined VOA in 2018, but her visa was terminated at the end of Trump's first administration.\n\nShe rejoined in 2023 because she wanted to be part of an organisation that \"upholds unbiased, factual reporting that is free from government influence\".\n\nThe recent cuts have left her \"feeling betrayed by the idea I had about press freedom [in the US]\".\n\nShe is also concerned for colleagues who may now be forced to return to hostile home countries, where they could be persecuted for their journalism.\n\nMeanwhile, the Czech Republic has appealed to the European Union to intervene so it can keep Radio Free Europe going. It reports in 27 languages from 23 countries, reaching more than 47 million people every week.\n\nRFA chief executive Bay Fang said in a statement that the organisation plans to challenge the order. Cutting funding to these outlets is a \"reward to dictators and despots, including the Chinese Communist Party, who would like nothing better than to have their influence go unchecked in the information space\", he said.\n\nRFA started in 1996 and reaches nearly 60 million people weekly in China, Myanmar, North Korea, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos. In China, it also broadcasts in minority languages like Tibetan and Uyghur, apart from English and Mandarin.\n\n\"[Trump's order] not only disenfranchises the nearly 60 million people who turn to RFA's reporting on a weekly basis to learn the truth, but it also benefits America's adversaries at our own expense,\" Mr Fang noted.\n\nWhile Chinese state media has celebrated the cuts, it's hard to know how Chinese people feel about it given their internet is heavily censored.\n\nOutside China, those who have listened to VOA and RFA over the years appear disappointed and worried.\n\n\"Looking back at history, countless exiles, rebels, intellectuals, and ordinary people have persisted in the darkness because of the voices of VOA and RFA, and have seen hope in fear because of their reports,\" Du Wen, a Chinese dissident living in Belgium, wrote on X.\n\n\"If the free world chooses to remain silent, then the voice of the dictator will become the only echo in the world.\"",

        "full_text": "The mother of a girl attending an Illinois middle school said that after her daughter refused to change her clothes in front of a biological boy who identified as a transgender girl, school officials stepped in and forced her to do so.\n\nNicole Georgas told the story of what she said happened to her 13-year-old daughter and other girls at Shepard Middle School while speaking at a Deerfield School District 109 School Board meeting on Thursday, National Review reported. Deerfield is a suburb of Chicago. Georgas said her daughter came home upset on February 5, saying a boy was using the girl’s bathroom.\n\nAccording to Georgas, the girl was then told by school administrators that the boy was allowed to use the girl’s locker room and bathroom because he identified as a girl, and the school’s “inclusive” bathroom policy allowed him to use whichever locker room he wanted. Georgas said she spoke to school administrators and told them they were violating President Donald Trump’s executive order that prohibited males from using female locker rooms and participating in girls’ sports. The school stood its ground, citing the district’s legal counsel.\n\nAfter this exchange, Georgas said Thursday, “the situation went from bad to worse.”\n\n“A few days later, the male student was present in the girl’s locker room. Feeling violated, the girls made the choice not to change into their PE clothes with the biological male student present,” Georgas said.\n\nThe mother said that school administrators then supervised the girls’ locker room to make sure that the girls changed their clothes in front of the transgender-identifying boy without protest. She identified the district’s assistant superintendent for student services, the school’s assistant principal, and the director for student services as the administrators who forced the girls to change in front of the boy, according to the Lake County Gazette.\n\n“The girls just want their privacy and they want their locker room back,” she said. “There are gender neutral options. This is my daughter’s story, and the story of many other young girls who have been forced at the difficult age to do something they know and most adults know is wrong.”\n\nGeorgas’ story received boos from transgender activists in attendance at the school board meeting, including one transgender-identifying person who also happens to have a child identifying as transgender.\n\n“The discomfort or privacy concerns of other students, teachers, or parents are not valid reasons to deny or limit the full and equal use of those facilities based on a student’s gender-related identity,” said the activist, who serves as the director of operations for Trans Up Front, an activist organization. “Instead, any student, teacher or other individuals seeking more privacy should be accommodated by providing that individual with a more private option.”\n\nGeorgas said she filed a civil rights complaint with the Justice Department.",

        "full_text": "Personnel from the Department of Government Efficiency, accompanied by DC police officers, gained access to the US Institute of Peace Monday after being turned away last week.\n\nThe dramatic escalation follows the Trump administration’s Friday gutting of the organization’s board and tees up another court fight between the administration and an independent organization.\n\n“DOGE has broken into our building,” acting USIP president George Moose, whom the Trump administration said has been fired from the role, said in a statement Monday.\n\nThe administration fired most of USIP’s board on Friday and its three remaining members – Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Defense University President Peter Garvin – said they were installing Kenneth Jackson as acting USIP president. Jackson was among the personnel who entered the building on Monday, according to the institute’s chief security officer.\n\nUSIP does not see that appointment as legal. The institute, which works to resolve conflict, is not a federal agency. It was created by Congress as a nonpartisan, independent body in 1984, and USIP owns and manages its headquarters.\n\nAccording to USIP’s chief security officer Colin O’Brien, the organization on Monday called the DC Metropolitan Police after former security contractors, whose contracts were suspended Sunday, entered the building without permission.\n\nWhen he went to greet the police, O’Brien recounted, “they held the door open and allowed members of DOGE to enter the building, where they were also followed by 10 to 12 police officers, uniformed DC police officers.”\n\nThose DOGE personnel, most of whom O’Brien said would not identify themselves, told him, USIP’s general counsel and members of the operations staff to exit the building, he said.\n\nMore police officers arrived later in the day with lock-picking devices and were seen entering a side door of the building.\n\nIn a post on X, DOGE alleged that Moose “denied lawful access to Kenneth Jackson, the Acting USIP President (as approved by the USIP Board).” DOGE said DC police “arrived onsite and escorted Mr. Jackson into the building.”\n\n“The only unlawful individual was Mr. Moose, who refused to comply, and even tried to fire USIP’s private security team when said security team went to give access to Mr. Jackson,” DOGE said in the post, which linked to a memo from the three Trump officials appointing Jackson as acting president.\n\nA DC police spokesperson told CNN that the police department responded to an unlawful entry report at USIP. “Individuals who were asked to leave by the management at that facility left,” they said. “There were no arrests made and no incidents to report.”\n\nSome USIP officials remained in the building after DOGE’s arrival, including Moose, a retired career diplomat. He was later forced to exit the building by DC police.\n\nIn an interview done by phone from his locked office as DOGE went through the building, Moose said he had expected DOGE would return to try to gain access to USIP.\n\nOver the weekend, he said, “representatives of the FBI and of the US Attorney’s Office of the District of Columbia were approaching members of our staff and our workforce to try to intimidate their way into getting into the building.”\n\n“We had not expected that the FBI would succeed in enlisting the support and collaboration of the District of Columbia police, with whom we have had a great relationship,” Moose said. “Somehow, FBI has managed to convince the DC police that this is a building that is owned by the US government and not by the US Institute of Peace.”\n\nO’Brien told CNN that the FBI called him over the weekend, and two FBI agents went to the home of one of his security officers.\n\nThe FBI referred a request for comment to the DOJ. CNN has reached out to the Department of Justice.\n\nMoose said that USIP plans to fight the DOGE moves “vigorously” in court.\n\n“We are confident of our legal status, and we are confident that a court that gives us a hearing will be persuaded by the strength of our legal argument,” Moose said after departing the building.\n\n“It’s not the first building I’ve been called upon to try to defend. We’ve had to defend embassies all around the world, in Africa, where I spent most of my career in pursuit of our mission,” he said. “This is obviously, this is not a great day for this. This is not a happy day for anybody that somehow, this misunderstanding of our intent, our purpose has reached a point where folks are going to come and try it.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Don Beyer, who arrived on the scene later in the evening Monday, said he’ll “report back to House leadership” and “we’ll try to do something in the US Congress.”\n\n“USIP is a congressionally chartered nonprofit. It is not a federal agency. We think it’s clearly illegal and unconstitutional for DOGE to be taking it over,” he told CNN.\n\nO’Brien, the chief security officer, said he had never experienced anything like Monday’s events in his tenure at USIP.\n\n“It’s disappointing,” he told CNN. “When you look at the mission of the United States Institute of Peace, its job is to prevent Americans from getting into costly wars. It’s to bring peace, and our president has said he wants to be a peacemaker, and we are ready, willing and able to assist with that mission.”",

        "full_text": "Voters are starting 2025 sour on the state of the economy and President Donald Trump’s handling of it so far, even as his election to a second term sparked an upswing in positive feelings about the direction of the nation, according to a new national NBC News poll.\n\nBuoyed by jubilant and unified Republicans, who are standing in lockstep with Trump and the expansive agenda he and congressional leaders are pushing in Washington, more registered voters see the U.S. as heading in the right direction than at any point since early 2004, though a majority still say the country is on the wrong track. Trump’s approval rating also equals his best-ever mark as president (47%), though again, a majority (51%) disapproves of his performance.\n\nMeanwhile, driven in part by a pessimistic shift among Democrats since Trump’s election, just 18% of voters rate the economy as “excellent” or “good” — not as low as the poorest economic marks during the Biden administration, according to CNBC polling from 2022, but within a handful of points and as low as that mark has been in NBC News polling since 2014. Majorities of voters disapprove of Trump’s early job performance on the economy (54% disapprove, 44% approve) and how he’s handling inflation and the cost of living (55% disapprove, 42% approve).\n\nIt’s a new development for Trump, who never previously had a majority against his handling of the economy in a national NBC News poll. Now, he is confronting jittery markets and businesses amid his early moves to put tariffs on U.S. neighbors and other allies. Trump also faces questions from voters about whether he is sufficiently focused on their core issue of costs as he pursues other projects like reshaping the federal bureaucracy.\n\nOverall, the poll reflects an America that remains deeply divided in the months following Trump’s 2024 victory, as it was in the months before.\n\nVoters narrowly disapprove of Trump’s overall job performance, but the margin is closer than at almost any point during his first term. His personal ratings and the share of Republicans identifying as part of the MAGA movement have grown, reflecting the unity inside his party giving him wide latitude in a GOP-controlled Washington.\n\nIn another change from Trump’s first term in the White House, the public has come around on his deportation-focused immigration policies, though voters are wary of his handling of other issues, including foreign policy.\n\nVoters like the general idea of the Department of Government Efficiency, the Trump-blessed effort to slash government jobs and spending. But they harbor reservations about its rapid-fire execution so far, as well as about billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk, DOGE’s de facto head.\n\nAnd voters are split evenly on which party they’d like to see win the 2026 midterm elections, even as the Democratic Party faces record-low popularity and fractious divides over how to respond to Trump. (The survey was conducted March 7-11, before Senate Democrats provided a handful of votes to help resolve a government funding fight.)\n\n“While this survey shows a mixed result for Donald Trump, Democrats are the ones in the wilderness right now,” said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies. Horwitt called Trump’s upside-down numbers among independents “a flashing red light across the survey.”\n\nMcInturff noted how Trump has fortified his base over the last year. The political story of the next year, he said, will be whether voter dissatisfaction on the economy or other issues takes hold — “or the strength of the Republican and Trump base has maintained a very competitive election” in 2026, McInturff continued.\n\nTrump's expanded base and key issues\n\nTrump’s job approval rating (47%) and personal favorable rating (46%), along with the 44% who believe the country is on the right track, are at all-time highs in NBC News polling during his political career.\n\nBut they are also far below where previous presidents stood during the “honeymoon period” of new administrations, marking the polarization that has defined the Trump years. Slightly more disapprove of Trump’s job performance (51%) and view him personally negatively (49%), and 54% see the country as on the wrong track.\n\nUnderscoring the deep partisan divide, Trump has the largest gap of any president in the last 80 years between his approval rating among members of his own party (90%) and his approval rating from the opposing party (4%), according to an analysis of three decades of NBC News polling and earlier data from Gallup.\n\nAmong independents, 30% approve and 67% disapprove of Trump’s performance in office. A large gender gap still persists, with men approving of Trump’s job performance 55%-43%, while women split the other way, 40%-58%.\n\nVice President JD Vance is viewed positively by 41% of voters and negatively by 47%. That compares unfavorably to the even or positive appraisals of vice presidents at the beginning of the previous three administrations, according to NBC News polls.\n\nWhen it comes to the issues, Trump fares particularly well on immigration. Fifty-five percent of voters approve of his handling of border security and immigration, while 43% disapprove. A similar share, 56%, say he’s bringing the “right kind of change” on the issue, while 25% say he’s bringing the wrong change and 18% say he isn’t bringing change.\n\nBut that’s the only one of the five issues tested in the poll — border security and immigration, foreign policy, the economy, inflation and cost of living, and the war between Russia and Ukraine — that sees a majority of American voters approve of how Trump is handling it.\n\nForty-five percent of voters approve of his handling of foreign policy and 53% disapprove of it, while 42% approve of his handling of the war between Russia and Ukraine, with 55% disapproving.\n\nCost concerns dominate on the economy\n\nThe split between how voters see his delivery on immigration and on economic issues comes after Trump identified them as the twin pillars of his 2024 victory, telling NBC News’ “Meet the Press” in December: “I won on the border and I won on groceries.”\n\nJust 1% rate the economy as “excellent” and 17% as “good,” with 39% calling it “only fair” and 43% rating it “poor.” While Republicans are more likely to have favorable views of the economy than others, majorities across virtually every demographic still view the economy in an unfavorable light.\n\nAbout one-third (32%) of voters say their family’s income is staying about even with the cost of living, but 60% say it’s falling behind. Another 7% say their family’s income is rising faster than the cost of living.\n\nAsked to gauge their satisfaction about how much Trump is doing to battle inflation, a majority say they aren’t satisfied — 46% say they are “not at all satisfied” and another 9% say they are “not too satisfied,” while 20% are “somewhat” satisfied and 23% are “very” satisfied.\n\nThe NBC News poll also gauged voters’ feelings on what kind of change Trump is bringing as president, with 40% saying he’s bringing the right kind of change to inflation and the cost of living, while 30% say he’s bringing the wrong change and 28% say he isn’t bringing change.\n\nOn trade and tariffs, 41% say he’s bringing the right change, 38% say the wrong change and 18% say he is not bringing change.\n\nOverall, 46% said Trump is bringing the right kind of change, 30% said he’s bringing the wrong kind of change, and 21% said he’s not bringing change.\n\nDOGE and Musk are early flashpoints\n\nVoters are open, narrowly, to an effort to tackle inefficiencies in government. But concerns about Musk and about how DOGE is executing those cuts could be a public opinion liability for the administration.\n\nForty-six percent of voters say establishing a Department of Government Efficiency was a good idea, while 40% say it was a bad idea and another 13% do not have an opinion. However, DOGE itself is viewed unfavorably, with 41% holding positive views of the effort and 47% holding negative views.\n\nAnd Musk is unpopular, with 51% holding negative views of the tech mogul and 39% viewing him positively. Half of voters (49%) say they have positive views about federal workers, while 21% view them negatively and 29% feel neutral about them.\n\nAsked to reflect broadly on DOGE, one-third of voters said Musk and DOGE’s efforts to reduce spending and the size of the federal government “should continue as much more needs to be done.” Meanwhile, 28% say “it is needed but should slow down to assess the impact.” And another 33% say “it is reckless and should stop now before more damage is done.”\n\nDemocrats at a low point\n\nWhile Trump’s standing is largely based on overwhelming support from within his own party, the Democratic Party now sits at its lowest favorable rating in the history of NBC News polling. Just 27% of registered voters view the party positively. That includes just 59% of self-identified Democrats.\n\nMeanwhile, 65% of Democrats say they want Democratic lawmakers to stick to their positions even if this means not being able to get things done in Washington, while 32% want them to compromise with Trump to gain consensus on legislation.\n\nStill, voters remain split as to who they want to control Congress after next year’s midterm elections: 48% back Democrats, while 47% back Republicans.\n\nHow different groups are handling Trump\n\nAs Trump dominates Washington, 53% of registered voters say Republicans in Congress are too supportive of the president, 6% say they are too critical and 39% say they are dealing with Trump in the right way. By comparison, 50% say congressional Democrats are too critical of Trump, 16% say they are too supportive of him and 30% say they are dealing with him in the right way.\n\nA plurality, 44%, believe the Supreme Court is dealing with Trump in the right way, while 35% believe it’s been too supportive and 14% believe it’s been too critical.\n\nA near-majority, 49%, say that CEOs of large corporations are too supportive of Trump, 29% believe they are dealing with him correctly and 12% believe they are being too critical.\n\nAnd when it comes to the news media, 46% of voters say it has been too critical of Trump, 25% say it’s been too supportive, and 24% say it’s been dealing with Trump the right way.\n\nThe NBC News poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters from March 7-11 via a mix of telephone interviews and an online survey sent via text message. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.",

        "full_text": "President Trump announced he will release 80,000 pages of unredacted files Tuesday about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, after promising on the campaign trail to declassify the documents.\n\n“While we’re here, I thought it would be appropriate — we are, tomorrow, announcing and giving all of the Kennedy files. So, people have been waiting for decades for this, and I’ve instructed my people … lots of different people, [Director of National Intelligence] Tulsi Gabbard, that they must be released tomorrow,” the president told reporters while touring the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.\n\n“You got a lot of reading. I don’t believe we’re going to redact anything. I said, ‘just don’t redact, you can’t redact,’” the president said, adding it will be about 80,000 pages that he described as “interesting.”\n\nHe said he has “heard about them” when asked if he has seen what’s in the files; he added, “I’m not doing summaries, you’ll write your own summary.”\n\nTrump in January signed an executive order directing the release of federal government documents related to the assassinations of Kennedy, former Attorney General Robert F .Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nThe order instructed the director of national intelligence and attorney general to present a plan within 15 days for the “full and complete release of records relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.”\n\nTrump promised during his 2024 campaign to declassify the remaining government documents about the John F. Kennedy assassination, which has remained a point of public interest for decades after Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas in 1963 by Lee Harvey Oswald. Conspiracies have persisted about CIA involvement or the existence of another shooter.\n\n“I said during the campaign I’d do it, and I’m a man of my word,” Trump said Monday.\n\nTrump made the same pledge during his first term, but he ultimately kept some documents under wraps amid intelligence concerns.\n\nThe last large dump of documents was in 2022, when the National Archives released nearly 13,000 new files related to the assassination.\n\nCongress passed legislation in 1992 requiring all remaining government records about the John F. Kennedy assassination to be released by October 2017, unless they posed certain risks to national defense or intelligence, and both Trump and former President Biden issued extensions to keep certain documents private.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc.

        "full_text": "I’ve been spending some time recently with top Democrats, as they think about how to rebuild after the 2024 loss. And I’ll say that in some years I’ve been covering politics, I have never heard them so confused. America is back. How could they possibly lost this election to this person. Also, how is the Democratic Party weakening. So much among groups whose strength, whose support it once took for granted. Young voters. Non-white voters. Working class voters. What does it mean that the Democratic Party is losing what was once its base, its reliable base. Someone whose analysis on this have come to respect over the years is David Shor. David Shor is the head of data science at blowers research, which is a big Democratic consulting firm. So first, this is a big table of numbers. It does a huge amount of political surveying and interpretation of data and testing of messaging. And he’s gotten a lot of things right before other people did, including that educational polarization was becoming the central fault line for American democracy. And so when I saw Shor recently and he began walking me through some of his slides, some of the ways he was interpreting the 2024 election and trying to help people see what had happened. My first thought was this would be worth doing in public, rather than this being a thing that Democrats are debating in Backrooms with each other. What if we did this in public. And so this episode is a bit of an experiment. He’s walking me through this presentation and I am interrogating it. But I found this really, really helpful. I don’t necessarily have every conclusion, David does, but I think it is a good place to begin. And there’s then a lot that can follow from having this conversation. As always, my email at nytimes.com. David Shor, welcome to the show. Excited to be here. So what do you do. And why should I trust the data you’re about to show us here. I’m glad. I’m glad you asked. I’m the co-founder of a research firm called blue rose research. We did 26 million interviews last year, and we have a team of about 45 people, machine learning engineers, software engineers from companies like Google. And, we’ve done a lot of work to try to figure out what actually happened last year. A lot of liberals I feel really burnt by survey data. There’s a sense that nobody picks up the phone. How are you surveying these older people if you’re doing it online. Putting aside the fact that you conducted a lot of surveys, why are you confident those surveys reflect reality. The fundamental problem with survey research is just that people who answer surveys are really weird. There’s two ways that you can try to fix that. One is that you could try to get a normal representative set of people. That’s just impossible in today’s day and age. And the other is that you can just try to collect a lot of information so that you can adjust for how weird they are. The reason I feel fairly confident about this is just in our work, every time we make any change to any part of our system, we go back and back, test and see how it affects accuracy across every other election that we’ve ever surveyed. We can’t be fully confident about any particular thing that we say. A lot of the data isn’t back yet, but I think that there’s enough data to tell a coherent story. There’s the 26 million survey respondents of 8 million unique people. There’s precinct and County level election results. We’re also going to try to tie together all of the external data that other people have done. And what I’ll say about this election is that our forecast. This cycle were very accurate. Our overall error was about 1/3 of a percent nationally. And I think that a lot most of the things that we thought would happen. Did bear out. And I do want to spend a second to answer, something that you had asked a second ago, which is just like, why look at survey data. I think that Super politically engaged people are overrepresented at every single step of the political process. They’re more likely to run for office. They’re more likely to work in campaigns and journalism. They’re more likely to listen to podcasts like this one. And I think that they’re really the only point other than election day, when regular people get a say is in polls. And so I think there isn’t really any Democratic alternative to trying to listen to the people and hear what they have to say. So I take that point. I always think it is good to remind me and everybody who listens to the show that they are weird. And if their intuitions about politics were shared, politics would not look the way it does at all. Right If the voting population were, show listeners and people they then elections end up very differently. So I take your point on survey data. So where do we begin. All right. So first I’m just going to start with this slide over here that just looks at support for the Democratic presidential candidate in 2016 and 2020 and 2024 by race and ideology. In 2016, Democrats got 81 percent of Hispanic moderates, and in 2024, Democrats got 58 percent of Hispanic moderates. That’s only about 7 percent more than the 52 percent that they got of white moderates. The main story with respect to this is just a continuation of the trends that we saw four years ago. Throughout the entire Trump campaign, we’ve seen this racial polarization. The thing I find most surprising here is you look at white voters liberal, moderate and conservative. And at least in this data from 2016 to 2024, there is a 0 percent swing in any of them, because there are all these things that if you go back to the debates we were having about Donald Trump, then it is the return and resurgence of a coalition trying to protect white power in this country. And I wrote things about this. I think there was good reason to believe that even if that was part of the intention, then that does not appear in the results. So the Democrats lose modest amount of support among Black voters in those years. They lose a huge amount of support among Hispanic voters and a significant amount among Asian voters. Why do you think that is. I think that a lot of political analysis in America has been really centered around viewing everything through a very America centric lens, because there’s this story in American politics. If you want to understand 20th century American politics, then the big story is that there was this giant Southern realignment in 1964, driven by the Civil Rights Act, driven by the Civil Rights Act, and that carried forward. It took a really long time for that to really work its way through downballot. And so I think it was really tempting for American political scientists and a lot. The more detail oriented American political pundits to just kind of see everything. People who wrote books like why were polarized, for instance. Yeah, exactly just to see everything through this transformation. Thomas Piketty actually recently wrote a great book about this thing I’m about to talk about. But I think the most important trend politically of the last 30 to 40 years, both here and in every other country in the world, at least Western country that has elections has been the story of education, polarization. That basically everywhere we’ve seen highly educated people move to the left and working class people move to the right. I think a lot of people’s analytical error when looking at Trump is that they saw Trump as this kind of reincarnation of the 1960s of like George Wallace or something, when really I think he was representing this global trend. You could look at a bunch of other countries. You have Marine Le Pen in France, you have the AFD in Germany. And I think that people miss that. There was kind of a broader global appeal, this kind of polarization on values. The other thing that I find interesting here is the shift in voters who self-describe as conservative, right. There’s no shift in white, self-described conservative voters between 2016 and 2024, but Democrats are winning 85 percent of Black conservatives in 2016, but only 77 percent in 2024. They’re winning 34 percent of conservative Hispanics in 2016. That falls by half to 17 percent in 2024. They’re winning 28 percent of conservative Asians in 2016. That falls to 20 percent in 2024. So it’s always a little bit weird for somebody who is self-described conservative to be voting for Democrats who are quite a Liberal Party now. But what we’re seeing among nonwhite voters is people voting more their ideology and less their ethnic group. That’s exactly right. And I would just say, I think this shouldn’t be that surprising. I think now, we identify the Democratic Party as straightforwardly liberal. The Democratic Party used to be a coalition between liberals and moderates and conservatives. And as liberals kind of became the dominant coalition partner. It makes sense, that the conservatives and moderates in our coalition, who were disproportionately nonwhite, given that this ideological polarization happened among whites 20 years ago or 30 years ago, that you would start to see this. All right. Let’s move to slide two here. All right. But there were some new trends this cycle. So I can hear you going to presentation voice. Yeah great. Great, great. You’re good. So this slide over here has what I think is probably the most important story of this cycle. So I have two graphs over here. The first breaks down 2020 for support by whether or not you had voted in 2020. And so this is New York Times’ data from Nate Cohen’s upshot polling, probably the highest quality public pollster in America. And what you can see here is just that in 2020, in their data, people who didn’t vote if they had voted would have been a little bit more Democratic than the country overall. But over the next four years, people who didn’t vote went from being a somewhat Democratic leaning group to a group that Trump won by double digits. So the second graph here, we have for every precinct, we look at what percentage of people voted in 2022. And then we just look at what was the change in Democratic vote share from 2020 to 2024. And so what you can see here is that for the lowest turnout precincts, Trump increased his vote share by something like 6 percent While for the highest turnout precincts, Harris actually increased her support. And that’s really the story of this election is that people who follow news really closely, who get their news from traditional media, who say that politics is an important part of their identity. They became more Democratic in absolute terms. But for people who don’t follow politics closely at all, they just became a lot more Republican. It’s interesting because I obviously get a lot of incoming from people who would like the New York Times’ to cover Donald Trump differently. And some of those arguments I agree with, some of them I don’t. That’s what I always think about with that, though, is that if your lever is New York Times’ headlines, you’re not affecting the voters you are losing. And the question Democrats are facing. When you look at how badly they lost less politically engaged voters is, how do you change the views of voters. You don’t really have a good way to reach. Yeah, and I mean, that’s 100 percent And, I just want to stress that this is a new problem. This problem didn’t exist four years ago. And it’s not just that New York Times’ readers are more liberal than the overall population. That’s definitely true. It’s that they’re more liberal than they were four years ago, even though the country went the other way. And so there’s this great political divergence between people who consume all the news sources that we know about and read about versus the people who don’t. And so, as a result of these changes, we’re really this is really reversed, a decades long truism in American politics where for the longest time, Democrats have said, and it’s been true, that if everybody votes, we win. And that higher turnout is good for Democrats, and this is the first cycle where that definitively became the opposite of true. Here I just have some numbers. If only people who had voted in 2022 had voted, Harris would have won the popular vote and also the electoral college fairly easily. While if everyone had voted, Trump would have won the popular vote by nearly 5 points. Generally, what you see now is that every measure of socioeconomic status and political engagement is just monotonically related to your chance of liking Trump. What is monotonically related. Yeah sorry. Just that this is why Democrats can’t win. That’s exactly right. I’m the problem. But it’s basically just that the more even the lowest political engagement categories, the lowest education categories, the poorer the lower socioeconomic status, the less engaged you are in politics now, the more Trumpy you are. And that just wasn’t true four years ago. So here here’s something that I’ve heard from a lot of Democrats and very good election analysts, which seems to be in some tension here. There is an argument that what happened to Democrats between 2020 and 2024 is their voters stayed home. And so what happened here was a shrinking of the electorate that disproportionately sliced off what Democrats for a while were calling the anti MAGA coalition. How does that idea that Democrats didn’t lose to Trump, they lost to the couch set with you. It’s just not empirically correct. I would say generally turnout and support go in the same direction for the basic reason that there are a lot of people who didn’t feel ready to vote for a Republican but were still mad at the Democratic Party, and so they stayed home in response. And if you just look at the demographics of who these people are, who voted for Biden last time and stayed home this time, they’re generally low education. They’re fairly politically disengaged. They’re much less likely to watch shows like MSNBC and more likely to watch shows like Fox, and they frankly just look a lot like the voters who trended away from us. So if you had forced them out to vote, they may have just voted for Donald Trump. Exactly And that does show up. If you look at African-Americans, for example, African-Americans who didn’t vote were much more likely to say that they supported Trump than the ones that did this cycle. It’s true that overall turnout fell in a lot of the country, but in the battleground states that actually decided the presidential election, turnout was roughly where it was from four years ago. And it just is clear as day that a bunch of people changed their mind. How much is this just inflation. You are dealing with people who they’re not paying a lot of attention to politics. They do pay attention and feel prices and the state of the country. You had a massive inflationary period and they’re pissed and being pissed about inflation. Move them against the incumbent party, which they held responsible in this country, as in other countries, for inflation. I think that that’s a very reasonable explanation. It makes sense that the people who care the least about politics are going to be the most mad about prices going up, and there’s a lot of academic reasons to think that makes sense. I’m not making any claims, per se, about why this happened, though I think inflation makes sense. If you actually poll these non-voters and ask them what did they care the most about they’ll tell you inflation. I’ll get to this later. But that’s what every single subgroup of the electorate cared the most about by overwhelming margins. And so I don’t think it’s necessarily true that it’s impossible for us to win those voters back. But, I’ll talk about this later. There have been dramatic shifts in the media consumption habits of these people in the last four years. And so it may be a harder problem. Before you discuss, I think it’s worth talking to the next chart, too, because it’s getting at the same question in a different way. So here, we have a plot that we just took from The Economist. And in the bottom, we just have foreign born population and on the top we just have increase in Republican vote share. And what you could see is there’s a very clear correlation. This is by County. This is by County. There’s a very clear correlation between how many immigrants there were in a County and how much it increased by Donald Trump, towards Trump. You can see in counties like Queens, New York or miami-dade and Florida. Trump increased his vote share percentage by 10 percentage points, which is just crazy. And so when we go and we look at the precinct election results, what we see is that in immigrant communities of all races, our best guess is that immigrants went from being a Biden plus 27 group in 2020 to a group that Trump narrowly won in 2024. This group, of naturalized citizens is roughly 10 percent of the electorate. So that means that immigrants swung much, much, much more than the median of the electorate. That’s exactly right. Our estimates, and it’s really hard to know exactly what happened. It turns out that working class immigrants do not answer a ton of surveys, but our best guess is that they swung 23 percentage points against the Democratic Party. And so the crazy thing is, if you believe this and there’s some uncertainty, but I think some version of this is probably true, then something like half of the net votes that Trump received came from immigrants. And this wasn’t efficient for him. It’s one of the big reasons, why the bias of the electoral college went down by so much this cycle. Because if you look in the battleground states, things swung toward Trump maybe by like half a percentage point. And that was enough for him to win or one percentage point. But if you look at the four biggest states where immigrants are concentrated New York, California, Texas, Trump did extremely well. And so it wasn’t very efficient for him. But in terms of people changing their mind It was a massive percentage of the story. So this gets to another way that I think the data has proven conventional wisdom from at least 2020 wrong. So 2020, you have an election that Joe Biden wins. He wins by less than the polling says he will win by. And one reason he wins by less than the polling says he’ll win by, is that Donald Trump does much better with Hispanic and Asian voters than he was expected to. And I remember seeing pretty strong research afterwards and talking to people who study the Hispanic vote who were saying, well, in 2020, the pandemic really scrambled what the election was about. So in 2016, the election was about immigration. In 2020, it was about the pandemic. It was about lockdowns. It was about the economy. And so Hispanic voters who were driven off of Trump by his border talk in 2016 were more likely to vote for him in 2020. But that was weird, right. It was the pandemic, in a way, moderating Donald Trump’s appeal. 2024 Trump runs, I would say, to the right of where he was on the border in 2016, right. We’re talking mass deportations. We’re talking more than a wall. And Trump does better among immigrant groups, and he really ever has before. So the Democratic belief that when the topic turned back to immigration, you would see some of that polarization around Trump return and that he would be harmed in immigrant communities did not occur. No inflation probably played some kind of role here, though. The flip side is if you look in the UK, it happened the same year. It’s just that the incumbent was right wing instead of left wing. And their labor did also drop with black and Asian and Hindu voters. And so I think that there’s some kind of globalized right wing phenomena that’s happening. It’s hard to know exactly what, but I agree completely. Now just move on to the next slide here we have Harris support by single age year by race and gender. I found this chart a little hard to read. So can you describe to me what’s happening here. Sure so we have four lines on this chart. And the x-axis is age. And the axis is our estimate. For what fraction of people in that group voted for Kamala Harris in 2024. And we have a light blue line for women of color. We have a dark blue dashed line for men of color. We have a light pink solid line for white women, and then a dashed line for white men. And one of the things you can see here is if you just look at 18-year-olds, 18-year-old women of color are the only of the four that actually voted that Harris won. Trump narrowly won nonwhite men. So I do find this part of this chart shocking it. I sometimes talk about narrative violations. And I think if we knew anything about Donald Trump eight years ago. It’s at young people did not like him. And Republicans are maybe throwing away young people for generations in order to run up their margins among seniors. But if you look at this chart among white men who were 75 years old supported Kamala Harris at a significantly higher rate than white men who were 20 years old. That’s exactly right. That’s a real shift. It is a real shift. This is the thing I am the most shocked by. I think in the last four years, is that young people have gone from being the most progressive generation since the baby boomers, and maybe in some ways more so to becoming potentially the most conservative generation that we’ve experienced maybe in 50 to 60 years. And so the next chart, just to describe it, this chart in some ways convinced me to do this podcast. Oh Thank you. This chart shocks me. I agree, this is to me the scariest chart in this entire presentation. And again, something I’m very surprised by. In the bottom, we have age, and at the top, we have the gender gap in support between women and men and for support for Kamala Harris. And so what you can see is that for voters over 30, the gender gap was fairly stable at around 10 percent which is roughly where it’s been in American politics. For voters over 75, it’s even lower. That’s right. Fairly low gender gap among older voters. Yeah, I think that a lot of people underestimate how recent the gender gap is. Historically, Republicans did better with women than men. And this was true across most of the West that center left parties did better with men than women. And that’s changed in the United States in the Clinton era. But it’s been stable since then. But what’s crazy is if you look at people who are under the age of 30, the gender gap has exploded. If you look at 18-year-olds, 18-year-old men were 23 percentage points more likely to support Donald Trump than 18-year-old women, which is just completely unprecedented in American politics. Is that abortion. I think it’s too early to say exactly what the cause is. What’s interesting is that this is happening in other countries as well. Obviously, different countries have different political systems, but I’ve seen similar patterns in Canada, in the UK, in Norway, there’s a lot of research to do here. But it’s still very striking. A lot of people talk about the Democratic young men problem, and I think it’s still somehow underrated because the actual numbers are just a lot worse than people think. The huge gender gap implies to me, it’s not just inflation. Women pay high prices for eggs, too. And I’ll say, if you look at the UK election last year, the Labour Party did a lot better because the incumbent party was unpopular. But I think what’s interesting is that if you look at it by age, the conservatives actually increased their vote share among 18 to 24-year-old voters, I think by 2 percent or 3 percent even though they only did even though they did 8 percent or 9 percent worse overall. And so I do think it’s not just inflation. It’s not just backlash to the incumbent governments, though I’m sure that’s part of the story, too. I feel like the story you’re implying that you believe here is that this is polarization among young men and women, driven by men who are in high school, who are young, who are online, practically online during COVID as MeToo is cresting at the time of as Jordan Peterson is a big figure. Andrew Tate is rising. UVA now gets called the manosphere. But there is a sense the Democratic Party is becoming much more pro-women party. And in some ways anti young men and that just had a huge effect on young men’s political opinions. Well, I do want to just stress that this seems to be a global phenomena. And I don’t want to over center the particular things the Democratic Party has done rather than the broader cultural. Peterson and Tate are global figures. No, exactly. I agree with that. What I’ll say is I just think that we’re in the midst of a big cultural change, that I think that people are really underestimating. If you look at Zoomers, I don’t have slides on this, but there’s just a lot of really interesting ways that they’re very different in the data. They’re much more likely than previous generations to say that making money is extremely important to them. They are a lot more. If you look at their psychographic data, they have a lot higher levels of psychometric, neuroticism and anxiety than the people before them. If I was going to speculate I think that phones and social media have a lot to do with this. I think it’s very plausible to me. And I’ve heard people describe that these kids grew up looking at social media influencers as role models. But all I can say is that I think that young people today seem to have fairly different values than they did 10 years ago. How that translates into partisan politics depends on what the parties do, but I think it’s a big shift. It seems plausible to me that social media, online culture are splitting the media that young men and women get that if you are young and online and a 23-year-old man who is interested in UFC, you’re being driven into a very intensely male online world. Whereas if you are 23 years old and female and you are interested in things that the YouTube algorithm codes, that way you are not entering that world. You’re actually entering the opposite world. You’re seeing brené Brown, right. You’re seeing these other things. The capacity to be in highly gendered media worlds is really different in 2024 than it was in 2004, and that’s true worldwide. Yeah, I agree with that entirely. Online communities are way more gender segregated than offline communities are. And so in that respect, it should be unsurprising that suddenly shifting a bunch of young people’s social worlds to be entirely online all at once cause the political situation to change. So Democrats are getting destroyed now among young voters. That’s right. I do think there was. Even as the idea of the rising demographic Democratic majority had become a little discredited in 2016 and 2020. I do think Democrats believed that these young voters were eventually going to save them, that this was a last gasp of something that if Donald Trump couldn’t run these numbers up among seniors. And you had millennials really coming into their voting power, Gen Z coming in. That was going to be the end of this Republican Party. And that just completely false. Yeah, I mean, it might be the beginning of this Republican Party. I have to admit, I was one of those liberals four years ago. And it seems like I was wrong. The future has a way of surprising us. The flip side of this is that Democrats made a bunch of gains among older voters, and I’m sure that they’ll be happy that they did two years from now, two years from now in the midterms. But if we don’t do anything about this, then this problem could become very bad. So right here, I have this slide. This is very simple. This is just showing exit poll favorability for the Democratic and Republican presidential candidate in 2020 and 2024. And I think it’s just really important to ground any discussion of the election with the simple fact that Donald Trump was just as unpopular on election day last year as he was in 2020 and maybe even a little bit more unpopular. But what changed is that Biden had a net favorability rating of plus 6, and Harris had a net favorability rating of minus 6. So I want to play Mike Donilon, who was chief strategist to Joe Biden, was recently at a forum, and he made an argument that I think you at least could read this chart as backing up, which is that Biden was more popular in 2020 than Harris was in 2024. Maybe the Biden Harris switch was a mistake. Here’s Donilon. Look, I think folks who had this view believe that Biden was going to lose. He didn’t have it anymore. He had to get out. That was the best thing for the party. I understand that’s their view. But, I have a view too, right. In my view, is that really I think it was insane. I think the party lost its mind. Did the party lose its mind. And that’s why we see this chart. I think the best explanation for why Kamala Harris was unpopular is in this next slide, which is just that the Biden administration was extremely unpopular for most of its term. They saw their approval fall off a cliff after Afghanistan, and then it dropped further as inflation and immigration and the budget fights all happen in the fall. And then it never recovered. And I think the big challenge that Kamala Harris faced was just that she was seen as too close, to the Biden administration, which most voters considered to be a failure. And so, I mean, you can never tell. You can never tell a counterfactual world, but I think that Biden would have had an even harder time distinguishing himself from his record. Yeah, it would be even harder for Joe Biden to run away from Joe Biden, I guess. Yeah, looking at this chart, it looks like by January a plus 20 net disapproval. Maybe that was a little bit smaller in November, but it had been widening. I mean, you go back to the beginning of 2023, it was narrower. People were really pissed at the Biden administration, by the time we hit the election. Yeah, I think that the big salient fact about this election. And, I don’t think it was impossible for Kamala to do better. This was a winnable election. At the end of the day, it was very close. But this was the big thing, that was weighing Democrats down. And so I just want to move forward, just in terms of why, in our polling, the way that we measure issue importance is we show people two random issues and we just ask which of these problems is more important to the problems facing the country today. And people pick. And when you model it out, whenever you have cost of living or inflation put up against something else, eight or 9 out of 10 people picked that cost of living and inflation was more important. And so I think this just really shows how dominant this was. Voters were really angry about the Biden administration’s handling of inflation, of the budget deficit of crime of immigration. And I think that was just a hard thing to escape. Well, you just ticked off a bunch of issues. But what’s interesting to me about this particular bit of data is it shows that cost of living and inflation beat almost anything you put in front of it, so I agree. What I find notable here I mean Yeah, cost of living was bigger than student debt fare, but you tested it against immigration and border security and the share of voters saying cost of living or inflation was more important was about 70 percent That’s right you tested it against abortion. Their cost of living or inflation was more important to about 80 percent of voters against environment and climate change. 84 percent of voters picked cost of living inflation. One thing that the Biden people always believed was that this election would be very heavily about democracy itself. I mean, this was something that I was told by top Biden strategists going way back. I don’t see democracy on here. January 6. The stability of the system. Did you test that, too. No we did. And later we have a slide on. I mean, I’m just going to scroll down to it now since you brought it up. But we did a survey where we just asked people, what’s more important right now preserving America’s institutions or delivering change that improves people’s lives. And it was 78 to 18. Delivering change that improves people’s lives. And I’m just going to scroll up. But I think what’s really hard, I think this has been one of the hardest things about being a political consultant in the last eight years is that every day, Trump does terrible things that I think are objectively awful and scary, and it piss me off. I’m going to prosecute my enemies or whatever. And then we do a bunch of tests and voters really don’t want to hear about it. From us, I think that Trump would do better if he didn’t do that stuff. For sure. But I think that voters want us to talk about concrete ways that they’re going to improve people’s lives. There is an argument you hear from many Democrats. There was no problem here except for inflation, that, in fact, if you compare Democratic vote outcomes with incumbent parties in many other countries, Democrats did better than incumbent parties in other countries did. So you look at the conservatives in the UK, they had a much worse election result. You look at what happened to the ruling coalition in France. In some ways Democrats were doing fine. They had a fairly modest drop in support. And it’s just a shame for them that inflation happened on their watch, that if Donald Trump had won the 2020 election, inflation would have happened on his watch, completely discrediting him and his administration. And that would have been the end of them. How do you distinguish between. There is a broad structural problem the Democratic Party is facing that it needs to think about for 2028, and there’s actually no problem here. But I think I just want to go over to the next slide. When we measure issues, we measure how important voters find it. And that’s what we have in the bottom here. And then we just measure. Do you trust Democrats or Republicans more on this issue. And what you see here is if you look at the top issues that voters care the most about cost of living, the economy, taxes and government spending the deficit, foreign policy, health other than health, where Democrats have a narrow lead, Republicans have massive trust advantages 15 points on all of the issues that voters care the most about. And so the story that I would tell in response to your question is that in this election, voters trusted Republicans way more than Democrats on all of the most important issues, but also bought into this idea that Donald Trump was a terrible person who couldn’t be trusted with power. And that made the election be close. But four years from now, Donald Trump will not be the nominee, and maybe they’ll nominate somebody who’s just as terrible and just as unlikable. But if we don’t, get out of this trust deficit, I think that we’ll have a lot of problems for people listening along. This is a chart broken into quadrants. That’s right. And the top right quadrant is issues that are very important and issues where Democrats are more trusted. And it’s an untilled bit of farmland up there. That’s right. So there’s mental health, which voters don’t rate that important, but they do trust Democrats quite a bit more. They rate it higher than they rate, though. Climate change and the environment and abortion, which struck me as surprising. Mental health seems like a much bigger deal on this then you typically then I think politics reflects on either side right there. One bright spot is really health care. That’s right. That’s kind of it in terms of issues where it is quite important and they have a genuinely noticeable advantage. Yeah, I think it’s just worth saying that four years ago the number one issue was COVID and health care. And those also were the issues that people trusted Democrats the most on. And so the strategy was really obvious. Just talk a lot about COVID and health care. But this time we had a much harder problem, which was that the issues that people cared the most about for the most part, voters didn’t trust us on and the issues that people did trust us on climate change, and reproductive rights, probably the big ones voters just didn’t care very much about. And so that was just a very difficult strategic position. And it’s also one that was just very different than it was four years ago. All right. I just want to tick off some issues voters ranked as important that they trusted Republicans on and then ask you a question about it. So they thought. Cost of living, the economy and inflation were very important. Had a lot more trust in Republicans. They thought national security and foreign policy were important. Trusted Republicans, taxes. Government spending. Government debt. Trusted Republicans. Crime immigration. Trusted Republicans. Social Security. Trusted Republicans. That seems like a bad one for Democrats, a political division they thought was important. They trusted Republicans. A bit more on that in this data. If I looked over time, if I looked at 2016 and I looked at 2020, would I see on all of these that Republicans had advantages and Democrats were just winning on health care. How much of this is something flipping around as an incumbent penalty and reaction to conditions in the country at that moment, and how much of it is a durable situation where Republicans have a trust advantage, where Democrats would have to act in a spectacular way over time to change voters impressions of them on that issue. What we saw in our data was that as the Biden administration became a lot more unpopular all of these things dropped a lot. So some of it was uniform shift. But I think that the last four years, there were some things that structurally changed a lot in every center left party in the world. Generally the left has its issues that it owns and the right has its issues that it owns. But usually the economy is pretty neutral. During the Trump administration, the economy was fairly neutral. And in 2020, I think if you looked at this and even in 2021, it really didn’t look anything like this. Another really big shift was just that education has gone from being basically one of the best issues for Democrats to being something that’s basically neutral now. And we saw that in the Virginia gubernatorial election in 2021, we even saw it be an advantage for Republicans. And then the other big shift in the other side was that reproductive rights used to be a fairly neutral issue for Democrats like in general. When you talked about it in the pre Dobbs era, it wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t something that changed a lot of oats. And immediately after Dobbs, we saw a party trust on reproductive rights shoot up. And so I think these numbers they do change. And this is one of the big messages I want to get through is just that, the world has changed a lot in the last four years. It’s going to keep changing. And we have to adjust in response to what happens. All right. So this tell me what’s going on in this next slide. Because I also, as I understand this is really very connected to the work you do specifically. So what are you doing here. All right. So one of the big things that my firm does, it’s probably our biggest product is that we do randomized controlled trials on ads. This is something that both parties do. This is pretty standard. But the idea is that for a given ad, you take 1,000 people split them into a treatment and control group. 500 people see the ad, 500 people don’t. And then you survey them after. And you see, ask them who they’re voting for. And then the difference between treatment and control can be described as the causal effect of if you see this ad, this is the effect it will have on your chance of voting for them. And so we tested on the order of I’d say probably like four or $5,000 Harris ads last cycle. And I just wanted to call out these two ads that were in the top 1 percent of ads that we tested. One is from Kamala Harris. I get it. The cost of rent, groceries and utilities is too high. So here’s what we’re going to do about it. We will lower housing costs by building more homes and crack down on landlords who are charging too much. We will lower your food and grocery bills by going after price gougers who are keeping the cost of everyday goods too high. I’m Kamala Harris and I approve this message because you work hard for your paycheck, you should get to keep more of it. As president, I’ll make that my top priority. Obviously, there’s a lot for several parts of the Democratic coalition there. Another ad by future forward shows attacks him for a national sales tax for the idea that Trump’s tax him being Trump. Yeah attacks Trump. He fights for himself and his billionaire friends. He intends to enact a national sales tax. The Trump tax that would raise prices on middle class families by $4,000 a year. Instead of a tax hike, we will pass a middle class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans. As attack is responsible for the content of this ad, these were obviously the best ads in the campaign. And the point, I just want to say is, I think this reinforces the point that what voters cared the most about was the cost of living, and that voters were really mad about the actual situation. And I think that Harris being able to in this ad acknowledging oh, things are actually very bad. I don’t like this. I have a plan to fix. This is part of what made it so effective. There is a view out there. I saw Jacobin had just done some research on this, which is a socialist publication that at the beginning of the Harris campaign, sprint, I mean, she was only the head of the Democratic ticket for three months. She was talking a lot about the economy and that by the end, she was talking a lot about democracy, that there had been a change in the nature of the campaign, the ads it was running, how they were messaging. Their big closing argument was that the ellipses in Washington, DC, which is where the January 6 riots, in a way, began that there was phases of the Harris campaign, and the first one was more populist and the last one was more institutional. From what you saw, was that true. I think that there was this big strategic question that Democrats faced. And it wasn’t just the Harris campaign, which is polling would tell them you should talk about the economy, or voters care a lot about the cost of living. But it’s very hard, one to get media attention on those things. And two, I think that Trump has done a good job of baiting us. I think what’s really interesting about a lot of the democracy and authoritarian stuff is just that how concerned you are by it really varies a lot by political engagement and by education and the kind of people who set media decisions at CNN or who work in politics are the kinds of people who are going to be much more concerned about it, than working class folks are. And so I think that but but look, there is a difference between the Harris campaign was running the optimal David Shor strategy in late October of 2024, and they were not. The Harris campaign had access future before it had access to all of this issue by issue polling. They had access to all this randomized ad testing. Did they run a heavily economic campaign and it didn’t work, or did they not run a heavily economic campaign at the end. And it didn’t work, because, look, if they did the thing and it didn’t work, then maybe it just didn’t work. Did they not do it. Yeah, I mean, asking the hard questions. But yeah, I think obviously, I think that Democratic messaging last cycle was not economically focused enough. I think that it focused too much on narratives of defending institutions, defending democracy. And I think it’s just very easy, for folks to fall into that trap. But I really don’t. But why. If they did that and I heard this from different people. David Plouffe is a smart guy. I’m not telling you to. I’m not asking you to critique David Plouffe. I can watch you getting physically uncomfortable as I. As I harm your business here. right, right. But these people all wanted to win. They really did. Every single one of them. And they had a lot of data. So I think this has been a thing on my mind. If they weren’t running the optimal strategy, why. I know it’s hard to get media attention for things, and that’s fair enough. But it’s also not impossible to get media attention for things right. For instance, it’s very easy to get media attention for anti-price gouging policies because there’s a lot of controversy over them about whether or not they worked. But they did make people talk about whether or not you were going to do an anti-price gouging policy. This is a Donald Trump move, constantly announce a policy that probably doesn’t work, or is in some way outrageous or beyond the bounds of political possibility, maybe isn’t even all that popular when you poll, but you get people talking about you having a very strong view. You’re going to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. Everybody knows Mexico isn’t going to pay for it. But you are talking about how Donald Trump hates immigration. And it breaks through. It is not rocket science to get people to pay attention. If Bernie Sanders had been running in the campaign, people would have paid attention to his economic messaging because he does economic messaging that creates conflict. If it was really this big delta between the economic push and the institutions push, and the institutions push is what got made, or at least got made more than 1, it should have. Why the thing I’ll say, in terms of why I’m sympathetic to the people who actually had these jobs and had to make these decisions, is it just feels wrong. I have a situation, I mentioned this before where donors will email me and they’ll be like Oh, look at this crazy, absolutely terrible thing, this evil thing that Trump is doing. We need to test it. We need to tell the voters, can you test it. And it really doesn’t work. People want to hear about eggs. And it’s easy for me to say that, because I don’t really I’m not directly in charge. But I just think it just feels really wrong when you’re in the moment. It’s just it’s very hard to totally shift direction, just because data tells you one thing. I do think the campaign photo ops that we all remember at the end are telling, which is it was an extraordinary visual. Harris at the Ellipse. And then there were the visuals of Donald Trump in a garbage truck and Donald Trump at McDonald’s. And there was a Ridiculousness to those visuals. I saw a lot of liberals making fun of them on various social media platforms, but there was something about which visuals are being chosen by the two candidates. I mean, of the two of them, only Kamala Harris had actually worked at a McDonald’s. Sure, but she wasn’t the one who ended up like putting on the apron and getting photographed at McDonald’s. And there’s a thing about what the candidates end up wanting to do that is meaningful to. And I do think there’s a way in which I wonder if that explains part of what we ended up seeing. Each coalitions campaigns are ultimately going to reflect the aesthetic and cultural choices of the people who staff them. And, it makes sense. If you had just said two years ago, Trump’s going to end by showing up at a McDonald’s. Like, it just wouldn’t have been surprising, I think. And so it’s just hard to escape, that kind of demographic pull. But we have to try because we have to actually win these people over. And so now I just have I have a couple more slides I want to go through. I talked about this before, but voters cared a lot more about delivering change than preserving institutions. And then we have this other polling question here, which I think is interesting, which is just asking people to pick between the statements. Things could be going better in America, but what we need is a return to basic stability. And the other is things in America are going poorly, and what’s needed is a major change and a shock to the system. And when you have those two things, it’s 53, 37, which is a lot wider than the election result ended up being. What really strikes me about this is that sometimes I read polls, and the wording is pretty clearly there to make something sound better than the other thing. Things could be going better in America, and what is needed is return to basic stability from whoever becomes president. And things in America are going poorly, and what is needed is a major change and a shock to the system from whoever becomes president. I would in some ways say the second there is worded to turn people off a little bit, it sounds disruptive crisis, a shock. It’s not just major change. It is something beyond that. And it dominates, I guess, though, I have a question about this, which is on the one hand, we see lines like that outpolling the incremental change everywhere. On the other hand, if you look at the New split ticket ratings for who overperformed in the election. Very moderate. House Democrats did very well. Totally there does seem to me to be a tension between two forms of political wisdom that both have data behind them right now. Which is that voters want huge, massive change. And the optimal political strategy is Joe Manchin or Jared Golden or Ruben Gallego, who are actually not. Or Susan Collins, who are not people who promise unbelievably shocking change. They are moderates who kind of tack between the parties a little bit and try to represent a center that wants something a little bit less dramatic than either side is offering. How do you reconcile them. There’s an enormous amount of status quo bias in politics. Campaigning on big policy changes can be pretty unpopular. But I think the way to thread the needle, what this is really saying is that voters were very angry about the state of things, and what they wanted tonally was someone who acknowledged that anger because Ruben and Gallego did a lot of criticism of the status quo and was able to outperform. So people on an angry moderate. That’s right. I think that’s exactly right. Like they want not AI always think of temperament and ideology as being separate axes in American politics that we connect too much. So we think about people who are moderates often have the moderate temperament. Susan Collins is like the great example, the joke always of the Susan Collins meter from somewhat concerned all the way to very concerned being the red line for her. You have a lot of moderates who by nature they’re pretty chill. They try to be civil. What this is implying is what people want are moderate policies in a more revolutionary or certainly more upset temperament. Yeah, we’re pissed, but not ideologically extreme about it. It’s like a funny chant. But when people think about moderates, they think of somebody like Joe Manchin, someone who’s just like down the line on everything. And the reality. I think that an accurate description of what highly educated moderates are like. But most low socioeconomic status moderates actually have fairly incoherent views. They’re liberal on some issues. They’re very conservative on other issues. And I think that that’s just like a much closer fit. For And that’s when you think of that, it’s maybe less surprising that a lot of them Donald Trump back in 2016, I wrote a piece about Donald Trump that has one of these headlines that now people will sometimes screenshot and be mad at me about but it’s called something like Donald Trump is a perfect moderate. And the point of the piece was not that he’s not extreme, because I think he is extreme, but that the way his politics worked, practically on the campaign trail in things he said, was that it was internally disorganized, so he’d be extremely Right on immigration. But compared to other Republicans, much more centrist on things like Medicare and Social Security. He would talk about giving health care to everybody, even though Republicans wouldn’t like that. He talked about raising taxes on people like him, not how he governed. But there’s a lot of research that actual moderates, people in the elected who are moderate. It’s not that they have in between the two parties view on everything, it’s that they might believe in completely legalized weed, on the one hand, and mass deportations on the other, that it’s like if you imagine positions as being they can be very liberal or very conservative. They average out to moderate as opposed to being consistently moderate. That’s exactly right. And the way I like to put that in math terms, the issue correlations for highly educated people are just a lot higher than they are. Your eyebrows get excited when you do math terms. Yeah no. I’m sorry. It’s all right. But I’m glad we started talking about ideology because that dovetails to the next slide. Here we just ask for each of the candidates. Do you think this candidate was more liberal than me, more conservative than me, or close to my views. So when you look at this slide, what you see is that 49 percent of voters said that Kamala Harris was more liberal than me, while only 39 percent of voters said that Donald Trump was more conservative than me. And so there was this big ideological perception gap where a lot of voters saw Donald Trump as more as more moderate than Kamala Harris. What did this look like in 2016 and 2020? So in 2016, it looked fairly similar to this. In 2020, perceptions of Donald Trump being too extreme went up relative to 2016, and perceptions of the Democratic candidate being too extreme went down from 2016 to 2020. Now that I think wasn’t a property of Joe Biden per se. Like, him being moderate was a big part of his brand at that time. But in our polling, we would ask, do you think that Joe Biden is too liberal or too conservative or whatever. And we saw that over the course of 2021, as his approval ratings dipped, the perception that he was too liberal also went up. Well, it’s also true that Joe Biden became more liberal like in terms of how he governed and in terms of what he ran on. So you’re saying that in the 2020 election, you actually did see people say that they were ideologically closer to Biden than to Trump. Yes And then over time, that eroded, that eroded. The thing I want to say here before I move on is I’m really not trying to beat up on Kamala Harris here. I think if you just step back, if you have a situation where the Democratic Party, where only 42 percent of Americans trust the Democratic Party on the economy relative to 58 for Republicans. Obviously, the standard bearer of the Democratic Party is going to be perceived as too left wing unless they unless they do a lot of stuff to try to counterbalance that. I mean, people were living under the biden-harris administration, whatever they thought of it. The line Trump would sometimes deliver on Harris, which in many ways is unfair if you’re a super politically engaged voter and you have a lot of thoughts about the powers of the vice presidency. But to most people, if you have all these great ideas, why don’t you do them. In the last four years, while your vice president was a pretty strong argument. I think there’s a good argument that given that, it’s amazing that we did as well as we did. But it was a close election. And so who knows what the counterfactual could have been. I want to note something as a dog that is not barking across this presentation. Yeah since the election, I think that if you look at what Donald Trump is doing, what Elon Musk is doing, and if you look at punditry about the election, that if everybody agrees on anything, it’s that the election was a huge verdict on wokeness. Famously, one of Trump’s higher testing ads was this Kamala Harris is her they/them Donald Trump is for you as you’re running through this. I’m not saying you’re saying DEI programs are popular, but I’m not seeing it emerge as a major explanation for 2024 here. I’m curious how you both think about it in the election and think about the role that’s playing in the post-election narrative. I just want to say, they/them ad that everybody talks about it was a good ad, but it was like a 70th percentile ad. In our testing, if you look at all of the best testing ads from Donald Trump, it was basically the economy. It was gas prices, it was immigration, it was crime. And so I think that there’s definitely been an overfocus on die, on wokeness, on trans issues. I think it definitely played a role on the elite discourse and why so many tech CEOs have become more right wing. And all of that. But I think that the voters were really mad about inflation and crime and immigration and the budget deficit. And I think the Republicans are making a mistake, honestly, to focus on these things. So much relative to concrete issues that people actually care about. I think that there’s this bigger picture point I want to make where I think that a lot of people see the Trump administration as kind of a break that shows that all of the traditional rules of politics, no longer apply. And I think to some extent that’s wrong, that a lot of what’s happening is really very easy to understand. Donald Trump, to go back to the ideological thing he broke with his party. He might have been dishonest about it, but he disavowed Project 2025. He said that he wouldn’t cut Social programs, he ruled out a national abortion ban. And I think that kind of thing just plays a big role in his success. And I think that a lot of these newer things that we talk about might be less important than we think. But the flip side is it’s possible that when it comes to something like, why is it that 20-year-old men are so much more conservative than they were four years ago. I could believe maybe wokeness has something to do with that, but I think that the bulk of this is traditional factors. So now I just have the last slide of the retrospective. What I have here is we have the share of voters who get their news from TikTok by year, the share of voters who get their news of young voters, who get their news from TikTok more than quadrupled in the last four years. This is the biggest and probably fastest change in media consumption. That has happened in my lifetime and it was quite correlated with support change. Now, obviously TikTok users are younger, they’re less politically engaged. It’s not surprising that we dropped among this group. You’d expect that from demographics. But if you go and you do the regressions, I think there was definitely a causal element there. And when you Zoom in, particularly to people who get their news from TikTok who don’t care very much about politics, this is a group that’s eight percentage points more Republican than they were four years ago. And that’s a lot. So by the end of the election, Donald Trump is promising to save TikTok. One possible explanation, then, for TikTok users shifting towards Trump is that they like TikTok, and they didn’t want it to be taken away from them. Another, which people have worried about quite a bit, is that the company behind TikTok could very easily have been turning dials just softly. It’s not that nothing that is liberal does well on TikTok. I’ve seen videos of me get posted there and do very well on TikTok, but that it would not be hard to turn up the dial a little bit on issues that are tricky for Democrats. On people complaining about the cost of living on pro-trump influencers. If everybody who the algorithm codes is, pro-trump gets a 7 percent boost. That is pretty that will not be obvious exactly on the app, but could be very, very meaningful in the aggregate when you look at this data. Do you think it is something about TikTok. Do you think it is something about TikTok’s audience just being young people who are seeing this movement. Or does it make you suspect dial turning. I don’t know the answer to that. It’s totally possible. Like, we know that they do. Dial turning on some topics, stuff like Ukraine or Tiananmen Square or whatever. But what I’ll say is, I think that TikTok represents something fairly radically different than social networks that came before it. And I’m sure you know that there could be some malfeasance on the part of people who work there. But the thing that I think about sometimes is just that. I think TikTok is really the first social media platform that is really, truly decentralized. Like if you. And what I mean by that is just it’s not based on follower graphs. Like if you look at reels or Twitter or whatever, how many people see a video or a piece of content is highly correlated with how many followers that person has. TikTok’s a lot more random, and there’s very interesting machine learning reasons for why but I think that it really allowed a lot of content that never would have gotten a lot of views on Twitter or on television to suddenly escape containment and get directly into the eyes of people who don’t care that much about politics. And, I don’t could tell a story that maybe just anti-incumbent stuff is going to do really well on TikTok and Democrats are going to do great. Now, I don’t really know. But I think that for whatever reason, this big change I think really did help Republicans. And it’s just an example of how the world has really changed a lot. So I know that you’re near Democratic both freak out and funding world. I hear a lot from Democrats about how to fix what they now call their media problem. Or sometimes you hear the TikTok problem, maybe pay try to seed creators and give them some support. When you look at this, do you think this is something that an established political party and a bunch of donors can do something about. Or do you think this is a TikTok is a vibes machine. And basically for reasons of inflation, for reasons of incumbency, for reasons of censorious Democratic Party that people got tired of the vibes are bad for Democrats in 2024, and vibes machines like TikTok some of the other social media things, they’re going to be an amplifier of bad vibes. So it’s not really a thing to do in the sense of strategy. What you’re trying to do is be culturally, both in terms of the candidates you have and the actual things you say and believe. Culturally a better product, and then the things that pick up good cultural products and amplify them are going to be friendlier to you. I think there’s a lot of truth in that. I think that TikTok is genuinely strange relative to platforms before it, in that its audience is more politically disengaged and more working class, and I think it’s just been very hard for us as a party to find creators and content that appeals to people like that because all of the people who work in Democratic politics are not like that. And I think that in the old traditional media world, we were a lot like the media gatekeepers. And so it was kind of clear how to win that war. And I think Democrats did a good job of doing it. But now we have a totally different fight. So just to move on and talk a little bit about the present as opposed to the long, long time ago of four or five months ago. So, you’ve talked a lot in your previous episodes about Trump’s flood the zone strategy, where he’s just constantly doing a bunch of stuff. And what we’ve done here is we’ve pulled all his executive orders and stuff that he’s campaigned on. I think we have something like 60, 60 dots here. Every one of these dots is a policy that we’ve pulled. And what you can see is that there’s a lot of variance. A lot of the things that he campaigned on no taxes on tips, deploying the military to the border. Voter ID laws, ending remote work for federal employees. A lot of that stuff is very popular. While the flip side is a lot of stuff that he’s actually doing. He talks about this stuff less, but Medicaid cuts, repealing the Aca, extending tax cuts to billionaires, a lot of that stuff is really unpopular. Just to say something a little controversial. I think a lot of the challenge of the Trump era is that they’re going to try to bait us we should do everything we can to actually meaningfully resist and protect populations that we care about and everything. But I think we need to make sure that we’re preserving a considerable amount of time, to attacking Trump on the most effective things that voters are concerned about. You used the term bait a few times. Yeah they’re going to try to bait us. I think of a political party baiting you as dangling something in front of you that they know is going to make you mad, but it isn’t that big of a deal. They’re doing mass firings around critical functions. They’re destroying USAID. They’re aggregating huge amount of executive power. The set of things that I find Democrats are really worried about at the moment. It’s on the one hand, I suspect they’re not the things that the public cares about wants to hear that much about making a podcast or the deputy director of the FBI. But at the same time, they’re not baiting. They’re real. They’re important. Like what is the point of a party that will not fight those. And this is a place where I think there is a tension between this focus on what’s popular. Don’t focus on just the things that activate your high education, high income base. But in terms of getting people out into the streets, potentially, if you need that, getting people to town halls, there’s sometimes I think this thought of the party is just going to I mean, James carville’s been saying Democrats should basically play dead for a while and wait until the Trump administration’s unpopular actions destroy the Trump administration, but don’t get in the way. Or there’s this version of a party that various things Hakeem Jeffries has said at different points have sounded like this to people, I think is thinking is a little bit more complicated than this. But we’re not going to run after all these things. We’re going to focus on the price of eggs, the price of goods. You can really lose your own base if you’re not defending democracy. When they care about democracy because you’re waiting for an opportunity to attack prices, when prices are going to do what prices are going to do. What Democrats say about prices isn’t the most salient thing. Am I getting what you’re saying right. Is there a way of threading the needle. How do you think about that. Yeah, I think you could imagine a theoretical world where we would have really hard and unpleasant trade offs. But I think the world we actually live in is that a bunch of the things that we’re extremely concerned about are actually really unpopular. And just kind of going forward to the next slide. Here’s some randomized control trial data that we did that I was talking about earlier with the ads, where we just kind of went through. And we looked at 58 different things that Trump’s going to do. And then we rank ordered them by how persuasive they were at actually changing people’s votes and making people disapprove of Trump. And I think that a lot of the things that we’re most concerned about Ellen, causing chaos in the federal government cuts to Medicaid and Medicare and Social Security, extending tax breaks for the rich. I obviously this list of things is not exactly the same as my top five things that I am personally most concerned about with the Trump administration. But I think that the Republicans are making a lot of unforced errors that make it easier to thread the needle on these things than I think it otherwise would be true. But these are also pretty small changes in Trump disapproval if I’m reading what this chart is. If Democrats attack Trump for cutting Medicare and Social Security or wanting to cut Medicare and Social Security, that increases Trump disapproval by 2.5 points. If they attack him for letting Ellen budgets, hurting Americans and putting privacy at risk, that hurts him by 2.2 points. Going down. Passing a one party power grab to cut government services without compromise. That’s 2.1 points. These kind of all look the same, and none of them are very big. Can you just like, think for a second like this is like, can you imagine 70 words you like, stop a Trump voter on the street and you say the 70 words to him, and then there’s a 2.2 5 percent chance he changed his mind. I think that’s incredible. I just think that these two pieces of data tell a story of how we should try to shape the campaign against Trump in the next couple of months, which is that he is wrecking havoc in the federal government. I think that is consistent with our principles and also something that voters are very concerned about. That he is trying to support for the safety net and that he’s trying to do tax cuts against the wealthy. And I think that a lot of this critique of Trump is really very similar to the campaign that we ran against Mitt Romney. And I think that this kind of gets back to what I was saying before of I feel like, we were so shocked by Trump that we kind of forgot that the old rules of politics. I want to read two of these because I think something you just said is important when we’re talking about these old laws of politics. So here, here’s these are all high polling, high testing messages. But this is the lowest one on the chart. So Trump is working to repeal a law that lowers the cost of health and prescription drug costs and caps insulin costs at 35 a month for seniors. By repealing this law, Trump will increase the cost of life saving medicine for millions and create more financial strain when costs are already too high. So that increases Trump disapproval by 1.9 points. I think that is as right down the middle, a Democratic message as you could possibly imagine that does not test as well as Trump is letting Elon Musk federal budgets with no oversight, checks or balances. Musk gave $250 million to Trump’s campaign, and now Trump is letting Musk reshape the government in ways that advance Musk’s interests, even if they hurt working Americans by cutting the basics like Medicaid and public schools. I am actually surprised that the Elon Musk is out attack is outpolling the insulin attack. And it’s interesting because I see this in Trump voters in my own life right there. Some of the ones I they’re actually not happy with what’s going on in the Trump administration. There’s a lot they don’t like. There’s a lot going on, but too much. But Musk creeps them out. Is that in your data. I think it’s really telling that Elon stuff floats to the top here because it’s really very hard for something to be competitive with, protect Social Security and Medicare. The fact that there are multiple Elon things up at the top, I think, really does tell a story that there’s something really unusual about what he’s doing. It’s very easy to tie what he’s doing to harming individual people. In ads, one of the clearest patterns in ads is that getting a real person and just having them stare at a camera and talk about the ways that Republicans have personally hurt them, it’s the best content. It’s funny, if you hire actors, it doesn’t work as well. People have tried. And that’s why in some ways, I’m optimistic that Democrats will be able to thread the coalitional needle here because we should like the two things that we should do is fight against social welfare cuts and also attack Elon Musk for the chaos he’s creating. And I think that that’s something that basically every wing of the party should be on board with. Donald Trump is polling better than he was at this point in his first term. And the vibes have really shifted in pro-trump direction. And look at how much he and Elon Musk are doing. And, I’ve certainly talked to Republicans who have this feeling that Trump has unlocked a political juggernaut here, that he has cracked the code of American politics. But you have this. This slide is titled Trump is vulnerable. So why is he vulnerable. Well the first thing you see is that he has been getting more unpopular rapidly as time has gone on. And I just think the most predictable thing in American politics, and we get surprised every single time it happens is the president comes in, he wins a trifecta, and then he does a bunch of unpopular stuff. He overreaches, and then he becomes very unpopular and loses big in the midterms. That doesn’t mean that you can’t avoid the cycle. But I think that in order to avoid it, when you look at the people who did the best job, Clinton in 1998 or Kennedy in 1962 they did it by engaging in an enormous amount of policy restraint. And that is just not what Trump has been doing at all. And I think that you can just see in the data. But his approval rating is dropping pretty quickly, and you can see that he’s just pissing off lots of people and that the stuff that a lot of the stuff that he’s doing and drawing attention toward is really quite unpopular. There’s also this reality of the coalitional realignment you were talking about at the beginning, which is Democrats now have this higher information, higher engagement coalition. Those are the people who turn out to midterms disproportionately. If I were a moderate Republican right now or a Republican in any way vulnerable, I know they’re all afraid of Elon Musk and they’re afraid of primaries. I’d be pretty afraid of losing, because it’s not just that you tend to have thermostatic midterm elections, but that the coalitions have been changing such that Democrats are able to survive the 2022 midterm, which should have gone against them. And I think Dobbs saved them to some degree. But also the fact that their coalition was as you showed earlier. If only 20, 22 voters had come out in 2024, Harris would have won. You got to be pretty confident in Donald Trump’s political skills to think that he is going to shift that dynamic. It seems that in addition to all the normal things that happens to presidents and midterms, the shape of the coalition makes midterms harder right now for Republicans. Yeah, I think that’s exactly right. But that said, it gets to this tension in all of these Democratic soul searching conversations, which is if Democrats do nothing really like, they’ll probably be O.K in 2026 because all of these voters, who get their news from TikTok, who don’t care about politics, these voters under 25, they just really are not going to vote very much in the midterms. But if we don’t fix this problem, then four years from now, we could be in the same trust deficit on all of these core issues. And these voters that didn’t turn out in 2026 will come back. And except we’ll be running against a candidate who’s a lot less unpopular, potentially, than Trump. And we could be in a real problem, a real, real pickle. How about the Senate. So you and I did a big piece on debates about populism a couple years ago, involved a model that you had, and that model was predicting in 2022, but specifically 2024 Democratic Senate annihilation. And Democrats are down a couple of seats in the Senate. It’s what is it, 5347 right. It’s not a good map for them in 2026. And they did lose some seats that were really important to them tester and Montana and Brown in Ohio. How do you see the Democratic Senate future. If you had told me in 2019, when I started worrying about the 2024 Senate election, that we would have 47 seats, I would have jumped for joining me. I think the really big factors there is they Republicans ran a bunch of really terrible candidates in a bunch of swing races. And it turns out Democrats, those Democratic candidates, did a good job of distancing themselves from the party. I don’t want to spend too much time speculating about the 2026 map, but I think that even though the bias in the electoral college has gone down quite a bit because of this swing among immigrants that doesn’t really change that. The Senate, it’s very hard for Democrats to take the Senate unless they can consistently outperform how Harris did and how Biden did in most of the country. These problems won’t be fixed unless we spend the next two years or four years, changing the party’s brand among working class voters who are overrepresented in the Senate. The one exception to this, I think and this is just controversial and might get me in trouble is I think that I’m just going to scroll up back to the Senate side. If you look in Nebraska, the single biggest overperformance that we had was Osborne running as an independent. He outperformed at the top of the ticket by 7.1 percent Now obviously, Nebraska is an extremely red state. And I think that we’ve only ever tried this strategy of running people who are literally formally not tied to the Democratic Party in extremely red states. But I think the argument for doing that kind of thing in an merely red states, in places like Florida or places like Ohio or Iowa. Those are hard questions. And it’s not up to me, what we end up doing, but I think it’s something that we have to really seriously consider. And then that also just brings up the really awkward point of like, well, what do we do with the reality that in most by land area, in most parts of the country, it’s almost impossible for a Democrat or someone with a Democrat on their ticket to win. What do you do about the reality of the Democratic brand is toxic in. Yeah most of the land area in the country, because I think you can have this conversation that you always have to be careful about which conversation you’re having is a conversation. Can Democrats win in 2026 or 2028? And the answer there is Yes. If the conversation is how do you get back to a place where you’re putting states in play that Democrats have just kind of given up on. Mitch McConnell is retiring in Kentucky. There’s a Democratic Governor in Kentucky. It’s not literally true that no Democrat can ever win there. I don’t think anybody seriously thinks so that a Democrat is going to win Mitch McConnell’s seat, because the Democratic brand nationally, which is different than it’s kind of state party brand, is pretty bad. And people understand when they’re voting for Senate, they’re voting for the National brand. So you been thinking about this for a long time. If you were trying to think about reversing these much deeper trends, right. These educational trends, this realignment that has. If your whole point in life was to make Democrats competitive again in Florida, in Missouri, in Kansas. Not the reddest states, but states that they were competitive in a couple of years ago. What would you advise Democrats to do. The reality of the situation right now, I think there are these big theoretical discussions we could have about what positions the Democrats could take. Is that Democrats are not in power right now. And so we don’t have agenda control. And I think a lot of this just depends on what Trump does and what. And then who replaces Trump. Something I’ll say going back to the 2016 the first time that Trump was president is that when we were looking at polling of non-college whites and these obama-trump voters, their approval rating for Trump was really very stable for most of his term. And the only time that it declined was when Trump tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And then we saw them revert to their old partisanship. But once that was out of the news, they switched back. And so I think that does kind of like at this moment, given that there is no party leader. I think it’s mostly a question of if Trump does successfully push a bunch of welfare state cuts, then that might change the realignment. But I think realistically, at least until 2026, it’s mostly a function of what Republicans do. But when we pick a new presidential candidate that will be a that will be a reset. And I think I don’t think it’s too early to talk about that, but I think that could imagine us picking candidates who would do a much better job. I think that is a good place to end. So always our final question. What are three books you would recommend to the audience. I’d say the three books for me, I want to call out hollow parties by Danny Salzman. He’s a good friend of mine, and I think it’s. And Sam rosenfelt and Sam Rosenfeld, of course, my old colleague. Yes I think it’s hard to talk about a lot of these questions that I was kind of dodging about why parties were doing what they did without kind of reading that. The other thing I want to call out is something that was hugely influential for how I think about politics is a really nerdy pick, but the origin and nature of mass opinion by Xolair. It gets at this question of how much does what people say in surveys matter versus how much of it is downstream of what people are saying what elites are saying. And I think his answer is mostly elites, but both. And then the last thing I just wanted to call out was a victory lap by Sasha Eisenberg. It kind of talks a lot about the history of the Democratic analytics industry. A lot of the stuff that these numbers that I’ve shared here come out of that machine. And so if you’re just interested in the history of the Democratic party’s internal analytics and research structure, it’s the only book really that’s ever been written about it. David Shor, Thank you very much. Thank you.",

        "full_text": "President Trump cloaked himself in core national security powers Monday as his attorneys told federal courts to butt out while he deports suspected gang members.\n\nThe administration, over the weekend, sent nearly 250 Venezuelans purported to be members of the Tren de Aragua gang to El Salvador, drawing scrutiny from a federal judge who had ordered the planes to be turned around and from immigrant rights defenders who said Mr. Trump was trampling on fundamental constitutional rights.\n\nThe Justice Department said Mr. Trump had declared Tren de Aragua as a terrorist organization and was acting under his powers as commander in chief and the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 when he ousted the suspected gang members.\n\nDeputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign asked a federal appeals court to step in and derail the judicial inquiry and take Judge James Boasberg off the case. He said Judge Boasberg was allowing terrorists to mount a class-action lawsuit without heeding national security.\n\n“The district court’s hasty public inquiry into these sensitive national security matters — with no contemplated protections against disclosure of operational details — underscores the urgency of immediate relief from this court, including an immediate administrative stay,” Mr. Ensign said in a filing asking Judge Boasberg be kicked off the case.\n\nThe fight goes to the heart of Mr. Trump’s biggest claims of his second term, including that his national security powers are virtually unfettered, that the country has seen an “invasion” of illegal immigrants, and the result has been a border emergency and an influx of terrorists in the form of cartel and transnational gang activity.\n\nSEE ALSO: Justice Dept. cites Trump’s commander-in-chief powers to defend deportations to El Salvador\n\nIn a hearing Monday, Judge Boasberg grilled the government’s attorneys, demanding to know the timing of the administration’s actions and whether they ignored his oral instructions.\n\nTwo planes appear to have been in the air during his hearing Saturday. Another seems to have departed the U.S. airport after the hearing. It’s unclear whether it left before the judge issued a written order.\n\nJudge Boasberg wanted to know whether any people he was trying to block from deportation were on that third flight and said he wanted the information fast.\n\nHe asked how many potential targets there are for deportation under the Alien Enemies Act and asked the administration to say whether it would reveal particulars about the flights and their timing.\n\n“If the government takes the position that it will not provide that information to the court under any circumstances, it must support such position, including with classified authorities if necessary,” he wrote in an order Monday night.\n\nHe gave the administration a deadline of noon Tuesday and told them they could file part of their answers under seal if necessary.\n\nHe is the latest judge to sharply question the veracity of Trump administration claims amid a flurry of lawsuits challenging the president’s executive actions.\n\nSalvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who is being paid about $20,000 per person per year to hold Tren de Aragua members in his Terrorism Confinement Center, mocked Judge Boasberg’s order.\n\n“Oopsie… Too late,” he posted to social media with a laughing emoji. The post was promoted by Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nHe released a video of his new guests, showing men being manhandled off the plane, having their hair and beards shorn off, dressed in white T-shirts, white undershorts and white sandals, shackled and taken to cells.\n\nMr. Bukele said the deal was good for all sides.\n\n“The United States will pay a very low fee for them, but a high one for us,” he said. He also said the MS-13 deportees on the flights would help his own country, where the gang has been based, to root out the gang’s money, weapons, drugs and collaborators.\n\nJudge Boasberg, an Obama appointee to the district court in Washington, quickly became a target of conservative outrage.\n\nA House Republican said over the weekend that he would introduce articles of impeachment to try to remove the judge.\n\nThe White House has embraced the fight over deportations, believing it has strong legal and political ground.\n\n“There were violent criminals and rapists in our country. Democrats fought to keep them here. President Trump deported them,” said Vice President J.D. Vance.\n\nTom Homan, Mr. Trump’s border czar and head of his deportation agency in the first Trump administration, said the U.S. ousted 238 members of the Tren de Aragua gang, based in Venezuela, and sent 21 MS-13 gang members to El Salvador.\n\n“With each criminal illegal alien being deported, neighborhoods are becoming safer,” he said.\n\nCongressional Democrats were far less excited about the way the situation is playing out. They accused Mr. Trump of violating the deportees’ “due process” rights.\n\n“This attempt to use an archaic wartime law — not used since World War II — for immigration enforcement is yet another unlawful and brazen power grab,” said a joint statement by Sens. Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, Alex Padilla of California, Cory A. Booker of New Jersey and Peter Welch of Vermont.\n\nThey said the U.S. is “not at war, and immigrants are not invading our country,” so there is no justification for using the 1798 law.\n\nThey said the danger is Mr. Trump will deport U.S. citizens “or people who haven’t committed a crime.”\n\nJudge Boasberg isn’t the first to order a deportation flight to turn around.\n\nIn 2018, in the wake of Mr. Trump’s attempt to stiffen asylum standards, Judge Emmet G. Sullivan ordered a plane headed for El Salvador to be returned and threatened contempt of court on U.S. officials who defied him.\n\nThe flight wasn’t turned around, but a mother and child who were the plaintiffs in a case before Judge Sullivan were kept on the plane as it flew back to the U.S.\n\nThe Tren de Aragua deportees aren’t the only case testing Mr. Trump’s powers.\n\nA Lebanese doctor was blocked by Customs and Border Protection officers as she tried to enter the U.S. on a guest worker visa last week.\n\nDr. Rasha Alawieh has been working in the U.S. for years on an H-1B visitor’s visa and is a professor at Brown University, but CBP officials say when she flew into Boston’s Logan International Airport on Thursday, she had images of Hezbollah figures on her phone.\n\nShe was put on a plane out of the U.S. on Friday, about the same time a judge ordered her to be kept in the country pending a decision.\n\nCBP said the order didn’t reach its staff at the airport until the plane had departed.\n\nIn court documents Monday, CBP justified the decision to block the doctor.\n\n“With the discovery of these photographs and videos CBP questioned Dr. Alawieh and determined that her true intentions in the United States could not be determined,” the documents allege, according to The Providence Journal.\n\nThe judge had scheduled an emergency hearing for Monday morning but canceled it after CBP’s new information and amid a change in attorneys for the doctor’s cousin, who filed a lawsuit to try to block her deportation.",

        "full_text": "Democrats have spent months debating how and why they lost the 2024 election. But the full picture of what happened on Election Day is only now coming into view.\n\nThe most authoritative election analyses draw on a variety of different data sources, including large sample polling, precinct-level returns, and voter file data that shows definitively who did and did not vote. And those last figures became available only recently.\n\nThe Democratic firm Blue Rose Research recently synthesized such data into a unified account of Kamala Harris’s defeat. (Blue Rose Research did ad testing for Future Forward, the largest PAC supporting Harris, which had disputes on strategy with the campaign itself.) Its analysis will command a lot of attention. Few pollsters boast a larger data set than Blue Rose — the company conducted 26 million voter interviews in 2024. And the firm’s leader, David Shor, might be the most influential data scientist in the Democratic Party.\n\nI spoke with Shor about his autopsy of the Harris campaign. We discussed the problems with the popular theory that Democrats lost because of low turnout; why zoomers are more right-wing than millennials; how TikTok makes voters more Republican; where Donald Trump’s administration is most vulnerable; what Democrats can do to win back working-class voters; and whether artificial intelligence is poised to turbo-charge America’s culture wars, among other things. Our conversation has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nBefore we get into why Democrats lost the 2024 election, let’s talk about how they lost it: Which voting blocs shifted the furthest right over the past four years?\n\nThe most important thing is that we saw incredible polarization on political engagement itself. There’s a bunch of different ways to measure this: There’s how many elections you vote in, or how important politics is to your identity. There’s how closely you follow the news. But across all of these, there’s a consistent story: The most engaged people swung toward Democrats between 2020 and 2024, despite the fact that Democrats did worse overall.\n\nMeanwhile, people who are the least politically engaged swung enormously against Democrats. They’re a group that Biden either narrowly won or narrowly lost four years ago. But this time, they voted for Trump by double digits.\n\nAnd I think this is just analytically important. People have a lot of complaints about how the mainstream media covered things. But I think it’s important to note that the people who watch the news the most actually became more Democratic. And the problem was basically this large group of people who really don’t follow the news at all becoming more conservative.\n\nIf they’re not responding to mainstream media information, where are they getting their views on politics? Is this group reacting to the prices at the grocery store, or firsthand experience of changes in the economy, immigration, or culture?\n\nMost people have to balance their reaction to objective facts in the economy with their preexisting ideological beliefs. A strongly Democratic voter isn’t going to switch to Trump just because they’re upset about high prices. So, it isn’t too surprising that the people with the weakest political loyalties would be the most responsive to changes in economic conditions.\n\nThis story was first featured in The Rebuild.\n\nSign up here for more stories on the lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat — and a closer look at where they should go next. From senior correspondent Eric Levitz.\n\nAnd people who are politically disengaged — like every other subgroup of people this election — overwhelmingly listed the cost of living as the thing they were the most concerned about.\n\nBut it can’t just be inflation. Politically disengaged voters went from being a roughly neutral group in 2020 to favoring the Republicans by about 15 points in 2024. But during the Obama era, this was a solidly Democratic group, favoring us by between 10 and 15 points. So there’s also this long-term trend that goes beyond inflation or social media. Our coalition has been transitioning from working-class people to college-educated people.\n\nTo move beyond the why, this shift in the partisanship of politically disengaged voters has a really important implication: For most of the last 15 years, we’ve really lived in this world where the mantra was “If everybody votes, we win.” But we’re now at a point where the more people vote, the better Republicans do.\n\nIf I understand you correctly, you’re suggesting that Democrats cannot rebuild a national majority merely by juicing higher turnout, since registered voters as a whole were more pro-Trump in 2024 than those who actually showed up at the polls.\n\nNevertheless, many progressives have attributed Harris’s loss to depressed turnout among Democratic voters specifically. They point to the fact that, between 2020 and 2024, the Democratic presidential nominee’s vote total fell by significantly more than Trump’s tally increased. And they also note that, according to AP VoteCast, only 4 percent of Biden 2020 voters backed Trump last year — while a roughly equal percentage of Trump 2020 voters switched to Kamala. So, in their telling, if defections roughly canceled out while a large number of voters went from supporting Biden to staying home, then clearly the problem was inadequate Democratic turnout. So if Harris had focused more on energizing the progressive base, she might have won. What do you think is wrong with that narrative?\n\nWell, the problem with the AP VoteCast data is that it was released the day after the election. There was just a lot of information that they didn’t have at the time. At this point, voter file data has been released for enough states to account for an overwhelming majority of the 2024 vote. And what’s really cool about having that data is that you can really decompose what fraction of the change in vote share was people changing their mind versus changes in who voted.\n\nAnd when you do that, you see that roughly 30 percent of the change in Democratic vote share from 2020 to 2024 was changes in who voted — changes in turnout. But the other 70 percent was people changing their mind. And that’s in line with the breakdown we’ve seen for most elections in the past 30 years.\n\nThe reality is that these things always tend to move in the same direction — parties that lose ground with swing voters tend to simultaneously see worse turnout. And for a simple reason. There were a lot of Democratic voters who were angry at their party last year. And they were mostly moderate and conservative Democrats angry about the cost of living and other issues. And even though they couldn’t bring themselves to vote for a Republican, a lot of them stayed home. But basically, their complaints were very similar to those of Biden voters who flipped to Trump.\n\nThe reality is if all registered voters had turned out, then Donald Trump would’ve won the popular vote by 5 points [instead of 1.7 points]. So, I think that a “we need to turn up the temperature and mobilize everyone” strategy would’ve made things worse.\n\nAccording to your data, voters who got their news from TikTok were much more likely to swing to the GOP than other voters, even after controlling for demographics. Why do you think that is?\n\nI think people can debate how much of this is the nature of the algorithm versus the strategic choices that the parties made. A lot of people argue that maybe TikTok just helps negative content get promoted, and that’s naturally bad for whoever’s the incumbent. But TikTok is also really different from social media that came before.\n\nOther social media sites are very dependent on what people call “the follower graph.” If you look on Instagram Reels, for example, the correlation between how many views a video gets and how many followers the creator has is extremely high. On TikTok, it’s quite a bit lower than any other platform. And the reason is TikTok uses machine learning to analyze a video — and make a good guess about whether it will be appealing — before they show it to anyone. So if your video is likely to be engaging, it can get wide distribution even if you don’t have a following. And that has been genuinely democratizing.\n\nWe used to live in this world where in order to get your message out there, you had to get people who write really well to absorb your message and put it out. And now, we’re in a world where anyone can make a video and if that video is appealing, it’ll get out there. And this is naturally bad for the left, simply because the people who write really well are a lot more left-wing than the overall population.\n\nOne of my favorite stats on this is something that Nate Cohn put out a couple years ago: Working-class white voters who’ve read a book in the last year are much more Democratic than working-class white voters who haven’t.\n\nSo what other groups did Democrats lose ground with, beyond those who pay little attention to politics and TikTok enthusiasts?\n\nIf you look at predominantly immigrant neighborhoods, whether they’re white or Hispanic or Asian or African, you really see these absolutely massive shifts against Democrats. Trump won Corona in Queens. Immigrants go from a D+27 group in 2020 to a potentially R+1 group in 2024.\n\nI’m not sure why that happened. I think we’re still waiting for data to come back. But I’d guess it’s the same stories about the cost of living and cultural issues and ideological polarization.\n\nSpeaking of ideological polarization: One of the findings in your data is that nonwhite voters who identify as “conservative” or “moderate” have been voting more and more like their white ideological counterparts over the past few elections. So, the electorate is polarizing less on race and more on ideology.\n\nI feel like there’s an argument that this was inevitable: Hispanic and Asian Americans were always likely to follow the political trajectory of other immigrant groups, many of which were tethered to the Democratic Party for the first couple of generations but then started to polarize ideologically as they became more affluent and assimilated. And you could perhaps tell a similar story about Black Americans, in which the easing of extreme racial oppression and segregation makes it easier for conservative African Americans to consider voting for the GOP.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe Democrats just made some avoidable mistakes that alienated these constituencies. So I’m wondering how you understand this development?\n\nIf we look at 2016 to 2024 trends by race and ideology, you see this clear story where white voters really did not shift at all. Kamala Harris did exactly as well as Hillary Clinton did among white conservatives, white liberals, white moderates.\n\nBut if you look among Hispanic and Asian voters, you see these enormous double-digit declines. To highlight one example: In 2016, Democrats got 81 percent of Hispanic moderates. Fast-forward to 2024; Democrats got only 57 percent of Hispanic moderates, which is really very similar to the 51 percent that Harris got among white moderates.\n\nYou know, white people only really started to polarize heavily on ideology in the 1990s. Now, nonwhite voters are starting to polarize on ideology the same way that white voters did.\n\nIf you look at African Americans, they did not swing nearly as much. But in our polling, before the Kamala switchover, Black voters were poised to swing 7 to 8 percentage points against us.\n\nAs to whether this is inevitable, I would say that to some degree getting 94 percent of any ethnic group is unsustainable. But I think the losses that we’re seeing among nonwhite voters and immigrants is symptomatic of this broader, ideological polarization that Democrats are suffering from.\n\nFundamentally, 40 percent of the country identifies as conservative. Roughly 40 percent is moderate, 20 percent is liberal, though it depends exactly how you ask it. Sometimes it’s 25 percent liberal. But the reality is that, to the extent that Democrats try to polarize the electorate on self-described ideology, this is just something that plays into the hands of Republicans.\n\nThis isn’t necessarily as ideologically restrictive as people think. If you look at moderates — and especially nonwhite moderates — a bunch of them hold very progressive views on a variety of economic and social issues. A very large fraction of Trump voters identify as pro-choice. We’ve seen populist economic messaging do very well in our testing with voters of all kinds. But I think that there are also some big cultural divides between highly educated people who live in cities and everybody else. And to the extent that we make the cultural signifiers of these highly educated people the face and the brand of our party, that is going to make everyone else turn against us.\n\nOne surprising thing\n\nYoung people have been one of the most reliably Democratic constituencies for more than a decade. According to the Democratic data firm Catalist, Joe Biden won voters under 30 by 23 points in 2020. But Blue Rose Research’s data suggests that Trump narrowly won that demographic in 2024.\n\nHow do young voters fit into this? In my understanding, young voters shifted significantly against Democrats in 2024.\n\nYeah. So this is related to the other trends: Young people are more nonwhite than the overall electorate. They’re more politically disengaged than the overall electorate. But the single biggest predictor of swing from 2020 to 2024 is age. Voters under 30 supported Biden by large margins. But Donald Trump probably narrowly won 18- to 29-year-olds. That isn’t what the exit polls say. But if you look at our survey data, voter file data, and precinct-level data, that’s the picture you get.\n\nAnd if you look at people under the age of 25, every single group — white, nonwhite, male or female — is considerably more conservative than their millennial counterparts. And it even seems that Donald Trump narrowly won nonwhite 18-year-old men, which is not something that has ever happened in Democratic politics before.\n\nSo, young people are quite a bit more right-wing than they were four years ago. And a lot of that is replacement. It’s a different set of young people. It turns out, people age.\n\nWhat’s your sense of why this generation of young people is more conservative than we were? Is it about each cohort’s distinctive formative experiences? In my understanding, political events that transpire during your adolescence and early adulthood can shape your worldview in a durable way. So, maybe the millennial generation came of age during the disaster that was George W. Bush’s second term, and then associated Democrats with an incredibly charismatic two-term president in Barack Obama — while young zoomers associated Democrats with Covid and inflation under Biden? Or is something else at play?\n\nYeah, I think some of that story is true. Yair Ghitza has an incredible paper that shows that people have formative political years. And you can predict a lot of how conservative someone will be from how popular the incumbent president was when they were teenagers or when they were in their 20s. And so I think that’s definitely true and it’s definitely part of the story. But I think that there’s more to the story than that.\n\nIf you look at the millennials, the millennials were more left-wing in a bunch of countries — Canada, the UK, and Europe. I think that there’s a story you can tell: Baby boomers were an incredibly left-wing generation in most places in the world. And millennials were their kids.\n\nBut Gen X was really quite a bit more conservative than the Boomers in most countries. And there’s a lot of theories you can make about that — response to the oil shocks, stagflation, neoliberalism. But whatever the reason, Gen X came out more conservative. So I think that part of the story is simply that the current crop of young people had Gen X parents. And in our surveys, if we ask people, “How Democratic were your parents growing up?” zoomers are something like 7 percent more likely to say they had Republican parents than millennials are.\n\nBut isn’t part of the Democrats’ problem with younger voters about men, specifically?\n\nYeah. There’s also this enormous amount of gender polarization. If you look at the gender gap — just what fraction of the vote Kamala Harris got versus what fraction of the vote Donald Trump got among men and women — for voters over the age of 30, there was about a 10 percent gender gap between men and women. And that’s, roughly speaking, where it’s been in American politics for most of the last 20 years.\n\nBut if you look at voters under the age of 25, the gender gap has doubled in size. And if you look at 18-year-olds specifically, 18-year-old men were 23 percentage points more likely to vote for Donald Trump than 18-year-old women. And gender polarization seems to be increasing in other countries as well. How it plays out varies from country to country. In Germany, for example, young women voted in very high numbers for Die Linke, the left-wing party there.\n\nA lot of different things could be causing this. But I think that if you look at non-political polling, you can really see evidence that there is wild, cultural change afoot here and basically everywhere else in the online world. In Norway, there’s a poll of high school students where the fraction of young men saying, “gender equality has gone too far” spiked in recent years.\n\nI don’t know necessarily what the answer to that is. But I think it’s important to resist nihilism. These young men who have terrible, retrograde views on politics and gender relations are still pro-choice. They still support universal health care. I think we need our politicians to focus on those fights. But it’s extremely important for other people — who don’t need to win elections — to try to improve the online discourse around these more divisive issues.\n\nEarlier, you referenced the divide between cosmopolitan, college graduates who live in big cities and working-class voters. And you suggested that Democrats need to distance themselves from the sensibilities of highly educated urbanites. I’m wondering if you could get more concrete. Do you think the party merely needs to increase the salience of its best issues by focusing on them rhetorically? Or are there areas where you believe Democrats need to become substantively more conservative?\n\nI think there are two very important things to understand about this election. The first thing is that the Biden administration was extremely unpopular. His approval ratings collapsed after Afghanistan and then continued to decline as prices went up and immigration happened. The budget fights in the fall of 2021 around the reconciliation package were particularly damaging. And then, his approval ratings never really recovered. And so, I think there’s a substantive angle to that.\n\nThe way that we like to track issues is that we look at 40 different issues and we ask people basically, “How important are these issues?” And then, “What party do you trust more on these issues?”\n\nIn 2020, what people cared about the most was Covid and health care. And those were also the issues that people trusted us on the most. And so the thing we had to do was very straightforward: We just had to talk about Covid and health care. That’s what we did. And we won.\n\nBut the situation this time was a lot harder. The issue that voters cared the most about was overwhelmingly the cost of living. I really cannot stress how much people cared about the cost of living. If you ask what’s more important, the cost of living or some other issue picked at random, people picked the cost of living 91 percent of the time. It’s really hard to get 91 percent of people to click on anything in a survey.\n\nAfter the cost of living, it was the size and scope of the federal government, the budget deficit, immigration, crime, and also health care. And people trusted Republicans on these issues by double-digits — except for health care, where we had a 2-point advantage, which was much lower than our traditional advantage on that issue.\n\nI think there’s this nihilism that’s very popular in our industry — that nothing we do, or that the other side does, really matters. But in the wake of inflation, voters went from favoring Republicans by about 5 points on the economy to favoring them by 15 or 16. And after Dobbs, voters started trusting the Democrats much more on abortion. Education used to be the Democrats’ strongest issue. But our standing on that collapsed during Covid, and now it’s basically even. So, what people care about and trust us on really is responsive to concrete events that happen in the world. That isn’t 100 percent of the story. There are a lot of other things going on. But what we do and what we say does matter.\n\nTo directly answer your original question — about how much of this is changing what our positions are versus messaging — I think the exact details of that vary from issue to issue. But I think that we have to approach this from the position that we are in a deep trust hole. The people that we’re trying to persuade have very different values than we do and have a very different perception of reality. And a lot of these people are very poorly informed and literally do not consume the sources of information that we broadcast to.\n\nAnd so, there has to be some combination of messaging and outreach and changes in how we approach these platforms, and also probably some substantive changes that address what voters see as an error.\n\nIt seems to me that the Democratic Party’s biggest challenge is less how to win the presidency than how to win comfortable Senate majorities. The median US state is much more conservative than America as a whole, and this means that the Senate is heavily biased against Democrats. In 2018 and 2020, Democrats won really strong national victories — and still ended up with just 50 Senate votes in 2021. So, how grim do you think the party’s prospects of winning back the Senate are in the near term, and how can it go about improving those odds?\n\nI think we should start by recognizing how lucky we are. In 2020, we won basically every competitive Senate race. And in both 2022 and 2024, we saw something that I had never seen before, which is that we did a lot better in swing Senate races than we did nationally.\n\nBut a lot of that was the other side running terrible candidates. And we can’t count on that happening forever. And even despite that — even despite historically well-run campaigns and historically weak opposition — here we are four years later at 47 Senate seats and with a very difficult path to getting back to 50 even in a wave Democratic year.\n\nAnd I think that something has to change in order for us to have a majority that’s capable of securing the Senate. But I don’t want to overemphasize the ideological dimension of that. What we really need to do to win in places like Ohio and Iowa is change the brand.\n\nThe candidate who outperformed the most in 2024 at the top of the ticket was Dan Osborn in Nebraska. And some of that was just because he ran as an independent. But a lot of it was that he ran an economically populist campaign that focused on issues that people cared about. I think that the moderate and left-wings of the party don’t like each other very much, but they did both like Dan Osborn.\n\nTo push back a little on that, Osborn definitely ran a populist campaign. But he also aired advertisements declaring himself “the only real conservative” in the race, attacked his Republican opponent for voting to fund the government, said that he would personally help build Trump’s border wall, and didn’t endorse Kamala Harris.\n\nAnd so, I feel like there definitely was an element of ideological moderation — or at least, heterodoxy — to his approach. More critically, Osborn refused to say which party he would caucus with once he got to the Senate. And yet, assuming he secretly did intend to caucus with the Democrats, that’s a play you can only run a single time. After that first run, voters know which party you really favor. And it doesn’t seem tenable for Democratic Senate candidates writ large to all pretend that they support Trump or might actually caucus with Republicans. So it’s not clear to me how the Osborn model scales.\n\nI think the main problem is that we tried this strategy in an incredibly red state. I think Trump won Nebraska statewide by 20.5 points. But there are a bunch of states he won by between 4 and 7 points. The degree of ideological compromise that is necessary to win in a state like Ohio is very different than the degree of ideological compromise that’s necessary to win in a state like Nebraska. And the current status quo is that we have a very low chance of winning in these places at all using the current strategy. But that said, I think that both wings of the party have to make sacrifices in order for us to achieve the coalition that we want.\n\nThere’s an interesting tension in your polling: Voters generally say that they would like the Democratic Party to be more moderate, while also saying they favor “major change” and a “shock to the system” because things in America are going poorly. I think many people would look at that and see a contradiction. After all, moderate Democrats generally have less enthusiasm for major policy change — and feel more comfortable with the status quo — than progressive Democrats do.\n\nIt’s tricky. On the one hand, voters say they thought that the Democratic candidate was too liberal. But on the other hand, in our randomized control trials, the best testing advertisements were more compatible with progressive critiques of the Harris campaign. The single best testing ad by the Kamala Harris campaign was one where she looked directly into the camera and said something like, “I know the cost of living is too high, and I’m going to fix that by building more housing and taking on landlords who are charging too much.”\n\nAnd I think you can get into existential debates about what economic populism really is. But I think that the existing research really pointed clearly toward the idea that the electorate wanted economic change — and cared more about that than preserving America’s institutions.\n\nWhatever you want to say about Trump, he has delivered a “shock to the system” — though maybe not the one that voters were hoping for. In your polling, has there been a reduction in support for the president since he took office? If so, where do you see him as being most vulnerable?\n\nYeah. Trump’s approval rating has dropped since he took office. His ratings on his handling of the economy, which historically was a strong suit for him, have dropped the most, and his handling of cost of living has also gone down by quite a bit. And Elon Musk has become much more unpopular and is now the most unpopular member of his administration by a good deal. Trump and Elon have really spent the first part of their term diving into the biggest weaknesses of the Republican Party — namely, they’re trying to pass tax cuts for billionaires, they’re cutting essential services and causing chaos for regular people left and right, while trying to slash social safety net programs. It’s Paul Ryan-ism on steroids.\n\nI think we have a real opportunity to return to the politics of 2012, in terms of vigorously opposing these very unpopular economic changes that Trump is pushing through.\n\nThe presentation that you’ve been giving to Democratic stakeholders takes a sharp turn at the very end. You warn that the party cannot get stuck fighting the last war, and argue that 1) AI is going to cause mass unemployment in the relatively near future, 2) this social and political shock is likely to exacerbate partisan tensions in the US, and 3) Democrats need to start preparing for this scenario. Can you explain your reasoning?\n\nI’m not an AI expert by any means, but AI capabilities are increasing dramatically. And AI experts are very, very bullish on the extent to which AI systems are going to be able to replace some fraction of jobs. The prediction markets say this, too. And I think something that’s really important is that regardless of whether it’s going to happen or not, the public believes it will happen.\n\nIf you just ask, “Do you believe that AI will be able to perform most people’s jobs better than humans can in the next 10 years?” 65 percent of the population says yes and 35 percent says no.\n\nAnd then, when you ask, “Do you think this will be good or bad?” Something like 80 percent of the population believes that this is going to be bad. And so, I think this is something where voters are ahead of the political classes of both parties right now.\n\nI think when you try to speculate about something like this, it’s important to recognize that nothing like this has ever really happened before, so it’s hard to make predictions. But we worked with two economists, Jonathan Hersh and Daniel Rock, who have made fine-grained estimates of which jobs are going to be the most affected by AI and which the least. And their work indicates that this will impact college-educated people more than working-class people for the simple reason that LLMs are advancing more quickly than robotics is. And AI will also have a bigger impact on employment in cities and suburbs than in rural areas. And it will impact women more than men.\n\nAnd I really worry that this may accelerate these cultural divides that politics have been centered on in the last decade, in a way that could be unproductive and dark. In a lot of ways, this could be the biggest culture war fight of the century. And I don’t pretend that I have the answer on what we should do. But with Covid, we had this sudden shock and our response just reinforced the dysfunctional cultural divides that had already opened up in 2016. And those effects have persisted and made it harder for us to win elections today. But unlike with Covid, we have a real chance of seeing this next shock a year or two ahead of time. And we really have to think about this proactively and not just dig our heads into the sand.\n\nCorrection, March 18, 12pm: Trump won Nebraska statewide by about 20.5 points.

        "full_text": "Annegret Hilse | Reuters\n\nGermany's Bundestag on Tuesday voted in favor of a major fiscal package, which includes changes to long-standing debt policies to enable higher defense spending and a 500 billion euro ($548 billion) infrastructure and climate fund.\n\nSome 513 parliamentary members voted in favor of the plan, while 207 voted against it. There were no abstentions.\n\nMore than two thirds of parliament were needed to support the package in order for it to pass. The law also needs to be approved by the Bundesrat, a body representing the country's states, on Friday to become enshrined in Germany's constitution.\n\nUnder the proposed new laws, defense and certain security expenditures above a certain threshold would no longer be subject to the debt brake, which limits how much debt the government can take on and dictates the size of the federal government's structural budget deficit.\n\nLoans taken on as part of the infrastructure fund would also be exempt from the debt brake, while Germany's states would also have greater flexibility around debt.\n\nCarsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, on Tuesday said the vote meant the debt brake rule is now \"not officially dead but buried alive.\"\n\n\"Germany has given up on leading the group of fiscal frugals in Europe for the sake of boosting its economy,\" he added.\n\nThe Christian Democratic Union, alongside its sister party the Christian Social Union, which jointly won the largest share of votes in Germany's national election in February, proposed the fiscal shift in collaboration with the Social Democratic Party. The factions appear likely to form the incoming coalition government, with the fiscal reform package a by-product of talks about a potential governing partnership between them.\n\nA tight vote\n\nTime pressure to pass the reforms is high as they require changes to the constitution and need the support of two thirds of both parliament and the Bundesrat.\n\nThis was likely only going to be possible before the newly elected parliament comes together for the first time next week, as parties opposing the fiscal package will then have a larger share of the vote and could potentially block the plans.\n\nSeveral of the parties that oppose the reforms have also unsuccessfully launched legal challenges to hinder the vote.\n\nLiesa Johannssen | Reuters\n\nIn the lead-up to the Tuesday vote, the CDU-CSU and SPD also had to negotiate for the backing of Germany's Green Party, ultimately agreeing on a compromise that includes 100 billion euros of the infrastructure fund being allocated to climate and economic transformation efforts and a broadening of the security-related issues exempted from the debt brake.\n\nA boost to the economy?\n\nAnalysts and economists have broadly reacted positively to the reform plans, viewing them as a potentially major boost for Germany's struggling economy.\n\nRobin Winkler, chief German economist at Deutsche Bank Research, urged caution, however, suggesting there was still work to be done for the incoming government.\n\n\"This is a historic fiscal regime shift, arguably the largest since German reunification,\" he said Tuesday after the vote. \"Yet, as with reunification, a fiscal expansion does not guarantee success: the next government will need to deliver structural reforms to turn this fiscal package into sustainable growth.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nThe German economy narrowly skirted a technical recession — or two consecutive quarters of economic contraction — throughout 2023 and 2024, but has been effectively stagnant.\n\nThe OECD on Monday said it was now projecting Germany's gross domestic product to grow by an annual 0.4% this year, down from the previously forecast 0.7% expansion. German economic institute Ifo, meanwhile, said it was cutting its outlook for the country's economy to 0.2% growth year-on-year.\n\nIt comes as Germany is facing sustained infrastructure problems, as well as issues in key industries such as housebuilding and autos. The country is also battling the threat of potential tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump on imports to the U.S. from Europe — which could be especially difficult for Germany due to its high levels of trade with the U.S.",

        "full_text": "Gaetz ended up withdrawing from consideration, but it doesn’t stop disagreements over how to proceed within the notoriously private committee from spilling out into the open, with finger pointing over the source of leaks potentially coming from inside the panel’s ranks. Democrats accused some Republicans of trying to shield Gaetz from scrutiny over allegations of illicit drug use and paying a minor for sex.\n\nThe Ethics Committee is never a coveted assignment, which means party leaders will inevitably have a difficult time finding members to reconstitute the panel, said one GOP lawmaker granted anonymity to speak candidly.\n\n“Nobody ever wants to sit on the committee,” the lawmaker said in an interview.\n\nBut the Gaetz episode has contributed to conditions from which the Ethics Committee could struggle to fully recover, former members said in interviews. It could plunge the panel into further dysfunction as the committee prepares in the coming weeks to ramp up after a monthslong delay and a pileup of potential cases.\n\n“It is a monster cloud,” former Rep. Mike Conaway, who served as Ethics Committee chair from 2013-2015, said of the allegations of leaks in the previous Congress that could plague the panel’s current membership.\n\nHouse Republican leaders tapped GOP Rep. Michael Guest of Missouri to return as committee chair, joining repeat Reps. John Rutherford (R-Fla.), Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.), Veronica Escobar (D-Texas), Deborah Ross (D-N.C.) and Glenn Ivey (D-Md.).\n\nNew Republican members assigned to the Ethics Committee will be Reps. Nathaniel Moran of Texas and Ashley Hinson of Iowa. Democratic leadership tapped Rep. Sylvia Garcia of Texas to join the committee, and selected Rep. Mark DeSaulnier of California as the new ranking member.\n\nAmong their first items of business might be resuming an investigation held over from the previous Congress into Rep. Cory Mills, a Florida Republican who drew attention last month over allegations of assault by the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nParamount to the committee’s integrity on all matters is its strict code of confidentiality: Members agree never to speak in any capacity about its pending business, on or off the record. After the events surrounding Gaetz, however, it’s not clear that confidentiality is still guaranteed.\n\nA flurry of news reports late last year revealed how members of the Ethics Committee were fighting over how to handle the Gaetz situation — insider information that spilled out into the public domain. Finger-pointing abounded as to who was leaking the private details, including the fact that there was a split secret vote on whether to release the Gaetz report.\n\nThese events also obliterated the longstanding presumption of nonpartisanship inside the committee, which is the only panel evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. Guest called the report’s release a “dangerous departure with potentially catastrophic consequences.” Speaker Mike Johnson had said he did not want the report to be public.\n\nIn a further divide, as the Ethics Committee deliberated on next steps, Democrats were making procedural moves to force a vote on the House floor to release the report on Gaetz. Rep. Sean Casten, an Illinois Democrat leading that effort, recently called the Ethics Committee “a speed bump on the road to hell [Johnson] is driving himself on.”\n\n“Everything’s become so partisan, and if [the committee] hasn’t become actually partisan, there’s suspicions of partisanship regardless of what people do or say,” said former Rep. John Yarmuth, a Kentucky Democrat who served on the Ethics Committee from 2011-2013, in an interview. “It undermines any decision the committee makes.”\n\nYarmuth added, “If you attack the credibility of the Ethics Committee, then nobody fears the Ethics Committee … I think you’d want to be afraid of running afoul of the Ethics Committee.”\n\nFormer Rep. Gregg Harper, a Mississippi Republican who served on the panel alongside Yarmuth, in the private sector now represents lawmakers who have cases pending before the House Ethics Committee and the Office of Congressional Ethics, a nonpartisan entity tasked with vetting outside complaints against lawmakers before sending them to the formal committee.\n\nHe said the decision to release the report on Gaetz after he had already left Congress undermined one of the key motivators of the Ethics Committee: Pushing bad acting lawmakers out of office. After all, Gaetz’s decision to resign from the House following his nomination to be attorney general by then-President-elect Donald Trump was widely seen as an effort to avoid the release of a damning report into his alleged misconduct that could foil his chances for confirmation.\n\n“It’s always been understood, ‘hey, if you’re in a mess, you leave — get out of there, don’t come back,’” Harper said in an interview. “The reality is sometimes a member needs to leave … one motivation to leave is, ‘Okay, I can put this behind me, and there won’t be anything else that I’ll to deal with, maybe, in the press.’”\n\nHarper and Yarmuth both recalled the discomfort they experienced when leadership drafted them into serving on the Ethics Committee. Harper said his colleagues asked if then-Speaker John Boehner was “mad at you about something?” Yarmuth said he was approached on the House floor by Rep. Maxine Waters, during the committee’s investigation into her dealings with a bank in which her husband had a financial interest.\n\n“How can you do this?” Yarmuth said Waters would repeatedly plead with him on the floor.\n\nIn a sign that leaders of the reconstituted Ethics Committee are for the time being adhering to the rules, a spokesperson for DeSauliner referred comment for this story to the panel’s staff director — whose job it is to interface with the media — citing confidentiality policies. The staff director, in turn, declined to comment. A spokesperson for Guest also referred press inquiries to the staff director.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who was the chair of the Ethics Committee from 2009-2011 — during which time she oversaw the investigation that culminated in a rare censure of a fellow member of her own party, the late-Rep. Charlie Rangel of New York, for tax violations — said she wasn’t sure where the panel would go from here.\n\n“It’s very difficult,” she conceded, when asked about the future of the panel in the wake of the Gaetz report. “But they operate with discretion, so we really don’t know the details.”",

        "full_text": "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) is facing the toughest fight of his Senate leadership career amid sharp attacks from his party’s base over his vote to advance a House Republican-drafted funding bill.\n\nSenate Democratic colleagues say Schumer, who is 74 years old, isn’t going anywhere as party leader, but they’re questioning his decisionmaking in a way they haven’t during his previous eight years as leader.\n\nMultiple senators complained about the lack of a clear strategy from their leadership heading into last week’s standoff with Senate and House Republicans over the House-passed funding bill, according to sources familiar with the sometimes heated discussions within the Senate Democratic Caucus.\n\nThe legislation cut $15 billion from nondefense programs and didn’t include guardrails to slow Elon Musk’s assault on the federal bureaucracy.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (Conn.), a rising Democratic star who has led the faction of Democratic senators calling for tougher tactics to resist President Trump, says he still supports Schumer as leader but warned that the party needs to show more urgency.\n\nAsked Sunday by “Meet the Press” host Kristen Welker if Schumer is the “best person” to lead Senate Democrats, Murphy said “he can lead the caucus” but cautioned “we need to have a conversation inside the caucus about whether we are willing to stand up to Republicans.”\n\nMurphy told The Hill that Senate Democrats risk becoming “irrelevant if we don’t use our power on cloture to demand that we have a seat at the table” on upcoming fights this summer and fall over raising the debt ceiling and funding the government.\n\n“We obviously have to make sure that we aren’t cut out of negotiations in the future,” he said.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said Democrats have “a lot of soul-searching” to do regarding strategy and tactics.\n\nSchumer has faced criticism — albeit indirectly — from a prominent member of his leadership team, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who declared after the disappointing 2024 election that Democrats were no longer the party of the working class.\n\nSanders accused Democrats in November of abandoning the working class, and he accused party leaders of defending the “status quo.” He also led opposition to the House-passed funding bill, saying it would “literally take food out of the mouths of hungry children, take health care away from seniors, and give a huge tax break to the wealthiest people on the planet.”\n\nMany Democrats were outraged by Schumer’s vote to advance the Republican spending bill; Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), a leading progressive, called it a betrayal.\n\nSaying it was a “huge slap in the face,” she noted that vulnerable Democrats in districts Trump won in 2024 risked their seats to vote against the bill, only to watch 10 Democratic senators “acquiesce” to the Republican legislation.\n\nThe backlash was so intense that Schumer postponed a publicity tour scheduled for this week to promote his new book, “Antisemitism in America: A Warning,” due to what his publicity team called “security concerns.”\n\nEven aside from last week’s battle, key Democrats are growing disenchanted with the party’s ability to connect with voters — especially white voters without college degrees.\n\nFormer Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who lost his seat in last year’s election despite Senate Democrats and their allies pouring tens of millions of dollars into his race, warned earlier this month that the Democratic Party’s reputation had become “toxic.”\n\n“We must reckon with how far our party has strayed from our New Deal roots. How we see ourselves — the party of the people, the party of the working class and the middle class — no longer matches up with what most voters think,” he wrote on the social platform X.\n\nSchumer responded to these criticisms in a New York Times interview.\n\nHe acknowledged the Democratic Party had “lost” its reputation with many voters as the party of the working class but insisted it wasn’t because its values had changed but because its messaging had failed to connect with too many Americans.\n\n“We always cared about the working people. But in the last few years, while we did a lot for working people, here’s what we didn’t do: We didn’t tell people about it. We thought, just by legislating, people would know about it. They don’t!” he said.\n\nBack in Washington, some Democratic lawmakers are privately grumbling over what many in their base view as the Democratic leadership’s feeble response to Trump’s agenda.\n\nSchumer’s press conferences vowing to resist Trump’s agenda earlier this year have been mocked by Democratic commentators on television and on social media.\n\nComedian Jon Stewart last month pleaded with Democrats to “stop f‑‑‑ing trotting Schumer out there every time Trump traverses into the unreal,” taking a shot at a Schumer news conference in which he used an avocado and Corona beer as props to illustrate his points about the economic impact of Trump’s tariffs.\n\nInside the Capitol, some Democrats are calling for Schumer to come up with a better game plan to counter partisan must-pass bills coming from the House.\n\nCritics within the party said that Schumer’s strategy last week appeared to be simply hoping that the partisan funding bill wouldn’t make it out of the House.\n\nBut some Democratic senators, notably Sen. John Fetterman (Pa.), thought it was likely that Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) would muster enough votes to pass the bill.\n\nSen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), the ranking member of the Budget Committee, took the lead in urging colleagues to vote against the House funding bill after it passed the lower chamber Tuesday.\n\nThey did so even after Schumer made clear to his Democratic colleagues in private conversations that he wanted to avoid a government shutdown at all costs.\n\nSchumer later argued on the floor that even though he thought the House-passed bill was “terrible,” it was still a better option than allowing the government to shut down.\n\n“Allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option,” he warned.\n\nSome Democratic senators who split with Schumer over his decision to help Republicans pass a partisan funding bill acknowledge he may have made the right call. They concede that it could have played into Trump’s and Musk’s plan to slash federal programs had the government shut down Saturday.\n\nAnd some Democratic senators are relieved Schumer and his close allies, including Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (Ill.) and Sen. Brian Schatz (Hawaii), took the tough votes to advance the spending bill so they didn’t have to.\n\nBut there’s growing frustration among Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill that they’re out of step with much of America.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have said for months that the results of the 2024 election, in which they lost control of the White House and Senate, shows their party is failing to connect with voters in a fundamental way.\n\nAfter last week’s bruising battle, some Democratic senators say it’s time to start thinking about who will succeed Schumer.\n\nBut even while Democratic senators start to mull a new generation of leadership, they emphasize Schumer is likely to stay in his job through 2028, when he will be up for reelection at the age of 78.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), the chair of the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, and Schatz, who is deputy Democratic conference secretary, are two lawmakers poised to move up the leadership ladder — as is Murphy, who spearheaded the negotiation of a bipartisan border security package last year.\n\nBut Klobuchar, 64, who ran for president in 2020 and gained more traction than many Democratic strategists expected, and Murphy, 51, may be harboring presidential ambitions.\n\nAnd Schatz, 52, has a lower public profile than many of his Democratic colleagues, even though he is a prolific presence on social media.\n\nSome Democratic lawmakers think it’s time for a “new generation” of leadership, which means that Murray, who is 74, and Durbin, who is 80 and considered likely to retire in 2026, are not first-choice candidates to replace Schumer.\n\nSen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), 66, who brokered a deal Friday with Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) to fix a provision in the House bill that would cut close to $1 billion from the District of Columbia’s budget, has been floated as a dark horse future candidate for leader. Van Hollen has kept a low profile in the Senate, but he held leadership positions in the House.\n\nSen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), 64, who led House prosecutors during Trump’s first impeachment trial in 2021 and represents the nation’s biggest state, is also seen as a rising star who could vault to the top of the leadership ranks once he has time to establish himself in the Senate.\n\nHe was just elected to the upper chamber last year, but colleagues are already touting him as someone with huge leadership potential.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc.

        "full_text": "Our immigration system is broken; you hear it being said all the time by politicians and media types, but what they never say is how or why. Their only response to anything related to immigration is “We need comprehensive reform,” which always includes “a pathway to citizenship,” which is code for voting. We see it. But the truth of the matter is that the system isn’t broken; the people running it are.\n\nIf you had a brand new car, opened the hood, and started pulling wires or loosening bolts, it would not work very well, would it? If you have an entire immigration system in place, then, over years, start ignoring parts of it while randomly changing other parts. How well do you think it will function?\n\nThat’s what these people have done to the immigration system. They whine is “broken.” You broke it, you jerks. It doesn’t need “fixing” by creating something new or wiping the slate clean, it needs to be allowed to function. They don’t let it. They won’t let it.\n\nPutting that aside, there is one question that needs to be asked of anyone looking to enter our country, either to visit or wanting to live here with the possibility of becoming a citizen: What do we get out of it?\n\nThat’s all that matters. If you bring nothing to the table, you don’t get in. Period.\n\nThat brings us to the case of Mahmoud Khalil.\n\nWe let him into the country to attend school, and he married an American. That’s still not a free pass to be here; he only has a green card.\n\nWhat does he bring to the table, exactly?\n\nHe apparently graduated 6 months ago but had time to lead pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, and anti-American protests at the school he used to attend. Columbia is very, very expensive; how can he afford not to work? They keep repeating how he’s “got a pregnant wife at home,” shouldn’t he be working? How about simply being at home, since his wife is 8 months pregnant and he’s just a simple family man, right?\n\nThe guy has more lawyers than some towns, each more expensive than the last, but he’s just an innocent guy who never did anything to nobody or something.\n\nThere are a lot of unanswered questions about what makes this guy so special: to somehow have mobilized the left in a way they haven’t been able to muster in years. Where does his money come from? Maybe he’s rich, maybe he married rich. Perhaps he has patrons? Perhaps it’s the left-wing industrial complex that launders USAID money to anti-American activities around the globe?\n\nAll I know is my question of “What do we get out of it?” doesn’t seem to have an involved answer.\n\nIt’s not like we need another anti-Semite; we have the Democratic Party, after all. We don’t need more anti-Americans; like I said, we already have Democrats. Do we need more people with graduate degrees in “public administration”? Don’t we produce enough of those from people born here with a lifelong understanding of our government and how it works? Do we need someone from Syria to do it?\n\nWe don’t, we’re all full.\n\nWe have all the native-born BLM/ANTIFA members; we don’t need more ungrateful, privileged 30-year-olds with nothing better to do than incite people. We’re lousy and overloaded with them.\n\nThe message should be sent that people can’t come to this country and disrupt it; inspiring violence or hatred is not going to get you welcome here; it will get you invited to leave. No other country would accept it; why should we?\n\nForeigners are afforded rights when they enter this country, but they are not citizens. People on vacation, in school, or married on green cards are here at our pleasure, not theirs. Break the law, and you’re out. Be particularly annoying, and you’re out. Or should be.\n\nWhen I was 15, I took driver’s ed. Throughout the 6 weeks, or whatever it was, the instructors drilled into our heads that “driving is a privilege, not a right,” and the state could strip us of it at any point, should we screw up and get too many tickets or whatever. Why should guests in our country not be treated the same way when it comes to being in the country? It’s a privilege, not a right, no matter the conditions you are here or for how long.",

        "full_text": "Stand clear of the closing era, please.\n\nThe MTA will stop selling MetroCards sometime after 2025 — ending an iconic part of city history and lore, MTA Chair and President Janno Lieber announced in a speech Wednesday.\n\nThe transit chief didn’t give a firm date for the familiar yellow-and-blue card’s finale, but this is the first time the MTA has given any kind of time window for the three-decade-old card system to be finally phased out for its much-sturdier and contactless counterpart, OMNY.\n\n“Goodbye, MetroCard. You served us well,” Lieber said at a Crain’s New York Business event.\n\n“But it’s time to retire you to the Transit Museum, to spend many happy days with your old friend, Mr. Token.”\n\nLieber promised existing MetroCards will continue to work at turnstiles for “at least six months” after the final date.\n\nThe MetroCard’s retirement has been a long time coming — as the MTA started eyeing the contactless method back in 2017, but the project was plagued with delays.\n\nIn October, the transit authority finally began replacing subway kiosks with ones that spit out OMNY cards. The month prior, student MetroCards were replaced by OMNY cards.\n\nOMNY, which can be accessed through mobile devices or through a $5 physical plastic card, was introduced in 2021 as a more convenient alternative to the old-school MetroCards.\n\nPlus, OMNY offers free rides after 12 swipes in a single week, making the contactless method more affordable to frequent commuters.\n\n“Why are we doing all of this? The answer is simple, making it easier to pay the fare and making it more affordable means more for paying customers,” Lieber said Wednesday.\n\n“Contactless fare payment is not only faster and more convenient, it’s going to allow us to do more, much more with discounts and promotions. It’s a much more dynamic system.”\n\nMetroCards have reigned supreme in the Big Apple since its introduction in 1993. The OMNY of its time, the originally blue cards replaced subway tokens, which were only sold in packs of ten, and introduced the city to the world of free transfers.\n\nMuch like the OMNY rollout, it also took years for MetroCards to be introduced. Carol Bellamy, the first woman elected to the City Council, floated the idea back in the 1970s, but the MTA didn’t seriously contemplate it until 1983.\n\nThe Whitehall Station was the first to get the automatic fare collection (AFC) turnstiles in 1994 — and sold 600 MetroCards on its first day, New York Transit Museum Curator Jodi Shapiro told The Post.\n\nIt would be another three years before the rest of the city’s stations and all the buses in the MTA’s flee had their own AFC turnstiles, an undertaking that cost almost $700 million at the time, and was one of the biggest projects in the subway’s then-90 year history.\n\nThe MetroCard vending machines were unveiled in 1999, over 2,250 of which are in subways today — but it wouldn’t be until 2003 that token sales finally ceased.\n\n“Let’s be honest. New Yorkers hate change. When the MetroCard debuted, plenty of die-hard token users struggled with the idea. But after a few years, public perception shifted, and I think the convenience of the cards was really appreciated,” said Shapiro.\n\n“That’s the New York way — resist, complain, learn the benefits, and adapt. Not exactly the Kubler-Ross model, but close.”\n\nDespite the initial resistance, the plastic passes quickly became much more than a method of transit and was quickly usurped into the identity and iconography of New York City.\n\nT-shirts, coffee mugs, pins and even Christmas tree ornaments emboldened with the distinguishable Helvetica font can be found throughout the five boroughs — and local artists have routinely turned toward the disposable cards as a form of media to craft their pieces over the last three decades.\n\nThe cards themselves have also served as canvases through the MTA Arts & Design program, Lilly Tuttle, Curator at the Museum of the City of New York pointed out. One such piece includes the 7 million cards simply printed with the word “Optimism” in 2009 as part of a mission to inject joy into the transit hubs.\n\nWhile OMNY also signifies a leap toward the future, Tuttle acknowledged there will be a void when MetroCards become nothing more than a collector’s item.\n\n“I think there will be something lost,” said the lifelong New Yorker, who keeps several subway tokens near the desk at the museum.\n\n“There’s so much nostalgia for the token and people remember the different token styles … At the MTA store, you can buy token earrings and token lapel pins and things like that. I can imagine that in the future the nostalgia for the MetroCard will only increase because it will feel sort of retro — that whole idea of bygone technology that people increasingly have a great, great affinity for.”",

        "full_text": "When the news broke on Jan. 31 that a New York physician had been indicted for shipping abortion medications to a woman in Louisiana, Dr. Kohar Der Simonian was hit by a wave of emotions, among them fear and concern.\n\nDer Simonian works as medical director for Maine Family Planning, which is 1,500 miles from Louisiana. Like the indicted doctor, Margaret Carpenter, Der Simonian mails abortion medication to patients in states where the procedure is banned — and her own name is written on the prescriptions.\n\nDer Simonian and other staff at Maine Family Planning know Carpenter through work relationships. They all understood that the battle over abortion had escalated. At a morning staff huddle at a clinic in Augusta about a week after the indictment, it was the first thing they talked about. The mood was heavy.\n\n\"It just hit home that this is real, like this could happen to anybody, at any time now, which is scary,\" said Der Simonian. But she took a moment to remind the staff that they had been expecting a case like this.\n\n\"We didn't know how, or to who, or what charges, right? But we knew that this was going to happen,\" she said.\n\nOn Jan. 31, Carpenter became the first U.S. doctor criminally charged for providing abortion pills across state lines — a medical practice that expanded after the U.S. Supreme Court's Dobbs decision on June 24, 2022, which overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nSince then, 12 states have near-complete bans and others have enacted bans after a certain point in pregnancy.\n\nCarpenter was indicted alongside a Louisiana mother who allegedly gave the pills that Carpenter sent to her daughter, a minor.\n\nThe minor wanted to keep the pregnancy and called 911 after taking the pills, which is how the police learned of the medication and its source, according to an NPR interview with Tony Clayton, the local district attorney prosecuting the case.\n\nOn Feb. 11, Louisiana's Republican governor, Jeff Landry signed a warrant for Carpenter. He later posted a video arguing she \"must face extradition to Louisiana, where she can stand trial and justice will be served.\"\n\nNew York's Democratic governor, Kathy Hochul, countered by releasing her own video, saying she was refusing to extradite Carpenter. The charges carry a possible 5-year prison sentence.\n\n\"Louisiana has changed their laws, but that has no bearing on the laws here in the state of New York,\" Hochul said.\n\nEight states — New York, Maine, California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington — have passed laws to protect telemedicine abortion providers and block extradition in such cases. But this is the first criminal test of these shield laws.\n\nMedication abortion via telemedicine has been growing in recent years — and is now playing a critical role in keeping abortion accessible in states with bans, according to research. Doctors who prescribe pills across state lines say they face a new reality where the criminal risk is no longer hypothetical.\n\nIf they stop, tens of thousands of patients in states with abortion bans would no longer be able to end pregnancies at home under the care of a U.S. physician. But these out-of-state doctors could end up in the crosshairs of a potential legal clash over the interstate practice of medicine, especially when state laws disagree on reproductive rights.\n\nDoctors are on alert, but remain defiant\n\nDer Simonian oversees a network of clinics across Maine that offer abortions, birth control and gender-affirming care. The clinics help out-of-state patients in two ways: by mailing them mifepristone and misoprostol, and by treating patients who travel to Maine for care.\n\nOne patient recently drove over 17 hours from South Carolina, a state with a six-week abortion ban. For Der Simonian, it illustrates how desperate some of her patients are for abortion access.\n\nThe indictment against Dr. Carpenter underscored the stakes for herself — and her clinic — of continuing to do this work, Der Simonian said.\n\n\"Most people that are abortion providers also have families and other jobs. It gets complicated, putting yourself at risk,\" she said.\n\nDer Simonian has decided she is still willing to continue doing it \"because it's what's right.\"\n\nData from the #WeCount survey conducted by the Society of Family Planning shows that in states with either total abortion bans or bans after six weeks of pregnancy, an average of 7,700 people a month ordered pills to end their pregnancies from out-of-state doctors practicing under shield laws from April to June of 2024.\n\nLouisiana has seen a massive expansion of telemedicine abortions since Dobbs was overturned. Nearly 60% of abortions among Louisiana residents were via telemedicine, the highest rate of telemedicine abortions among states with strict bans, according to #WeCount.\n\nOrganizations like the Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project (MAP) are responding to the demand for care. MAP was launched after the Dobbs ruling, with the specific mission of writing prescriptions for patients in other states.\n\nLast year, MAP was mailing abortion medications to nearly 500 patients a month. Since January, they're averaging 3,000 prescriptions a month, according to the clinic's co-founder Angel Foster.\n\nNearly all of the clinic's patients — 95% — live in states with bans on abortion or on telemedicine abortions, Foster said, and 80% live in Texas or southeastern states, a region blanketed with near-total abortion restrictions.\n\nDoctors who provide abortions often know each other, and have formed a tightly-knit support network. For example, MAP's Foster knew Carpenter, the doctor indicted by Louisiana.\n\n\"I very much support her,\" Foster said, \"I feel very sad for her that she has to go through all of this.\"\n\nMAP has four doctors on staff and is hiring a fifth.\n\n\"I think there will be some providers who will step out of the space, and some new providers will step in. But it has not changed our practice. It has not changed our intention to continue to practice,\" Foster said.\n\nMAP uses an organizational structure designed to spread potential liability, Foster said.\n\n\"The person who orders the pills is different than the person who prescribes the pills, is different from the person who ships the pills, is different from the person who does the payments,\" she explained.\n\nThe eight states that shield doctors who provide abortion care via telemedicine also have laws that safeguard doctors who provide in-person abortion care, according to a review of shield laws by the Center on Reproductive Health, Law, and Policy at the UCLA School of Law.\n\nAnother 14 states, most of which are controlled by Democrats, have either shield laws or executive orders that protect doctors who perform in-person care in that state — but not when they provide abortion care via telemedicine, the review found.\n\nMost of these shield laws address extradition or investigations of physicians in both civil and criminal cases. Carpenter was already facing a Texas lawsuit, filed in December, when Louisiana announced its criminal indictment.\n\nIn February, on the same day New York's governor rejected Louisiana's extradition request, a Texas judge ordered Carpenter to pay more than $100,000 in penalties for prescribing abortion pills to a woman near Dallas.\n\nThe shield laws are meant to protect doctors like Carpenter— as long as they stay in their home state. But if they travel elsewhere, they lose that law's protection.\n\nThese physicians accept there are parts of the country they can no longer visit, said Julie F. Kay, a human rights lawyer who helps doctors set up telemedicine practices.\n\nKay has worked with Carpenter; together they co-founded the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, along with one other physician.\n\n\"There's really a commitment not to visit those banned and restricted states,\" said Kay. \"We didn't have anybody going to the Super Bowl or Mardi Gras or anything like that. I've talked to doctors where it's not a good fit because they have an elderly parent in Florida, or a college student somewhere, or family in the South.\"\n\nGovernors clash over doctor's fate\n\nCarpenter's case remains unresolved. Legal experts interviewed by NPR say New York's refusal to extradite shows the state's shield law is working exactly as designed. But Louisiana officials have forcefully hit back in social media posts and media interviews.\n\n\"It is not any different than if she had sent fentanyl here. It's really not,\" Louisiana's Attorney General Liz Murrill told Fox 8 News in New Orleans. \"She sent drugs that are illegal to send into our state.\"\n\nTony Clayton is the Louisiana DA who brought the charges.\n\n\"I firmly believe that a denial of an extradition request from another governor is just a ministerial act, that we plan on challenging Governor Hochul,\" Clayton said. \"When the proper requests are made, she refuses to turn over [Carpenter], we will deal with that accordingly.\"\n\nLouisiana could challenge New York's law in federal courts, according to legal experts across the political spectrum, but has not yet taken that step. Clayton declined to say if Louisiana would do that.\n\nCase highlights fraught new legal frontier\n\nThe new shield laws challenge the basic fabric of U.S. law, which relies on reciprocity between states, including in criminal cases, said Thomas Jipping, a senior legal fellow with The Heritage Foundation, which supports a national abortion ban.\n\n\"This actually tries to undermine another state's ability to enforce its own laws, and that's a very grave challenge to this tradition in our country,\" Jipping said. \"It's unclear what legal issues, or potentially constitutional issues, it may raise.\"\n\nBut other legal scholars disagree. The Constitution only requires extradition for those who commit crimes in one state and then flee to another, said David Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University's Thomas R. Kline School of Law.\n\nTelemedicine abortion providers aren't located in states with bans, and have not fled them — therefore they aren't required to be extradited, Cohen explained. If Louisiana tries to take their case to federal court, \"they're going to lose because the Constitution is clear on this.\"\n\n\"The shield laws certainly do undermine the notion of interstate cooperation and comity and respect for the policy choices of each state, but that has long been a part of American law and history,\" Cohen said.\n\n\"Different states make different policy choices, and sometimes they're willing to give up those policy choices to cooperate with another state, and sometimes they're not,\" he added.\n\nThe conflicting legal theories would be put to the test if and when this case comes to federal court, other legal scholars have said.\n\n\"It probably puts New York and Louisiana in real conflict, potentially a conflict that the Supreme Court is going to have to decide,\" said Rachel Rebouché, the dean of the Temple University Beasley School of Law.\n\nRebouché worked with Cohen and another law professor, Greer Donley, to draft the first proposal for a shield law, and they helped pass the first such law in Connecticut, though it does not include telemedicine protections.\n\nIt was signed by the state's governor in May 2022, before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, in anticipation of potential clashes between states over abortion rights.\n\n\"What if states want to punish providers in other states who are providing abortions that are legal where they are, but not legal in the banned state? And that's really where the idea of a shield law came about,\" Rebouché said.\n\nHealth care provided through telemedicine is typically considered to be located where the patient receives that care.\n\nBut telemedicine shield laws explicitly seek to protect physicians regardless of the patient's location by creating a category of \"legally protected reproductive health activity.\" Rebouche said by protecting a physician engaging in telemedicine, the laws have the effect of shifting the location of care to the physician's state.\n\nSome states may add more legal protections for abortion providers\n\nCarpenter was charged because her name was found on the mailed prescription, Clayton told NPR.\n\nAfter the indictment, New York passed a new law that allows physicians to put their clinic's name — and not their own — on abortion prescriptions they mail out of state. The intent is to make it more difficult to indict individual doctors.\n\nDer Siomonian is pushing for a similar law Maine.\n\nDr. Samantha Glass is a family medicine physician in New York who has experience writing prescriptions for telemedicine abortions. She also travels to a clinic in Kansas about once a month to perform abortions.\n\nCarpenter's indictment could cause some doctors to stop sending pills to states with bans, she said. But Glass believes abortion should be as accessible as any other health care, she said, and plans on joining a New York practice that sends pills across state lines.\n\n\"Someone has to do it. So why wouldn't it be me?\" Glass said. \"I just think access to this care is such a life saving thing for so many people, that I just couldn't turn my back on it.\"",

        "full_text": "Greenland’s prime minister, Múte B Egede, has called for the international community to step in after it was announced that Donald Trump’s national security adviser and the US second lady will visit the Arctic island, accusing Washington of “foreign interference”.\n\nMike Waltz and Usha Vance are due to arrive in Greenland this week as part of a delegation that will also include the US energy secretary, Chris Wright.\n\nTrump has pledged to make the autonomous territory – part of the kingdom of Denmark, which ruled Greenland as a colony until 1953 and continues to control its foreign and security policy – part of the US, “one way or the other” and has refused to rule out using military or economic force to do so.\n\nA spokesperson for the Danish police said they had sent extra personnel and sniffer dogs to Greenland as they step up security measures before the visit. René Gyldensten said the extra officers, deployed on Sunday, were part of regular steps taken during visits by dignitaries but declined to specify the number of extra police flown in on a chartered aircraft. News reports put the figure at dozens.\n\nGreenlandic parties are currently in coalition talks after an election less than a fortnight ago in which the country voted for a complete overhaul of its government, with the Democrats replacing Egede’s party, Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA), as the biggest party in the Inatsisartut, the Greenlandic parliament.\n\nEgede reacted angrily to the White House announcement on Sunday, accusing Greenland’s allies of “hiding” and “almost whispering” their support. If the international community did not step up its support for Greenland, he warned, the situation would escalate.\n\n“Yes, the western allies stood together and helped each other through thick and thin, but it has turned upside down now with the sitting president in the USA,” he told the Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq.\n\n“But the fact that our other allies in the international community feel like hiding in a small corner and almost whispering that they support us has no effect, and if they do not speak out loudly about how the USA is treating Greenland, the situation will escalate day by day, and the American aggression will increase.”\n\nHe added: “So we need our other allies to clearly and distinctly come with their support and backing for us.”\n\nJens-Frederik Nielsen, the leader of Greenland’s Democrats, who is expected to become the next prime minister, called for calm and said they would continue to take the time needed to reach a “solid and sustainable political agreement”. He accused the US of a “lack of respect” in planning the visit while coalition talks were still happening.\n\n“The visit, which is said to be ‘private’, is pure charm offensive, and if we allow ourselves to be influenced by it, for example by rushing to form a new coalition, we may become even more vulnerable to pressure,” Nielsen told Sermitsiaq.\n\n“So let’s cool our nerves and maintain our common goal of showing the outside world that our country is not a commodity, and that we have sovereignty over the country, which must be respected and no one can take it away from us.”\n\nThe Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said on Sunday that the planned visit “cannot be seen independently of the public statements that have been made”. She added: “In the kingdom, we want to cooperate with the Americans. But it must be a cooperation that is based on the fundamental values ​​of sovereignty and respect between countries and peoples …\n\n“This is something we are looking at seriously. The dialogue with the US regarding Greenland will take place in close coordination between the Danish government and the future Greenlandic government.”\n\nAnnouncing the trip on Sunday, the second lady’s office said Vance would visit Greenland together with her son and a US delegation from Thursday to Saturday this week. The White House later announced that Waltz and Wright would visit the US military base in Greenland, Pituffik, for briefings from US personnel. They are expected to join Vance to visit historical sites and attend a dog sled race.",

The battles with the remnants of Hamas and Hezbollah come as a showdown with Iran and its nuclear program looms over the Middle East.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces struck dozens of Hezbollah rocket launcher sites on Saturday in the largest attack since the ceasefire. The attacks follow a rocket launch from southern Lebanon toward the Galilee. Israel called it a blatant violation of the ceasefire. Hezbollah denies they were responsible but the IDF claims the terror group continues to operate in the area.\n\nIn Gaza, the renewed military operation is expanding as another IDF division prepares to enter the fighting. The operations have been ongoing since the end of the ceasefire and the refusal by Israel to continue any negotiations while \"under fire.\"\n\nDuring the recent fighting, the IDF eliminated two prominent Hamas leaders.\n\nWhile visiting an IDF Armored Corps regiment on Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared, \"We are winning because we understand that in order to defeat our enemies, those who are closing in on us, we break through them with crushing ground force, in addition to the excellent work of the Air Force, Intelligence, (the) Navy and of course the Infantry.”\n\nU.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff blames Hamas for the collapse of the negotiations to free more hostages. “I was in Doha. I met with many of the leaders at the Arab summit. I thought we had a deal, an acceptable deal. I even thought we had an approval from Hamas. Maybe that's me just getting duped,\" Witkoff admitted while appearing on Fox News Sunday.\n\nHe added, “So, this is on Hamas. The United States stands with the State of Israel.

Iran has to give up its program in a way that the entire world can see,\" Waltz told CBS Face the Nation on Sunday. \"And this is, as President Trump has said, this is coming to a head. All options are on the table and it is time for Iran to walk away completely from its desire to have a nuclear weapon.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Israeli cabinet voted unanimously this weekend on a no-confidence vote to dismiss Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, whom the Netanyahu government believes is undermining the prime minister and his policies.\n\nThe unprecedented vote follows the firing of Ronen Bar, the head of the Shin Bet, Israel's version of the F.B.I. Thousands of Israelis took to the streets to protest the firing, while many Israelis believe the prime minister has both the authority and the reasons to dismiss Bar.",

        "full_text": "President Donald Trump is escalating his multi-front assault on what supporters see as an elite establishment, using raw presidential power to bend the government, law, media, public health, foreign policy, education and even the arts to his will.\n\nTrump left no doubt in last year’s campaign that he’d use executive authority to seek retribution against his political enemies. But his attempt to transform America’s politics and culture is far broader than a personal revenge trip.\n\nHe’s targeting Ivy League universities; using executive authority against top law firms; eviscerating the bureaucracy; rejecting 80 years of elite orthodoxy about American global leadership; and using tariffs to shatter the global trading system that Make America Great Again proponents regard as the self-enriching treachery of global elites.\n\nIn one recent example, the White House forced Columbia University to restrict demonstrations, review its Middle East curriculum, ban masks in protests and stiffen law enforcement. Other top educational institutions now feel vulnerable to possible attempts to impose Trump dogma. The strategy may widen the political opening created by conservative pressure on top colleges over anti-Israel protests amid the war in Gaza.\n\nAnd late last week, Trump directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek sanctions against lawyers and law firms who engage in what he regards as “frivolous, unreasonable, and vexatious litigation against the United States.” The memo was released after he canceled punishment against one top white-collar firm after the White House said it agreed to do $40 million in pro bono legal services to support administration initiatives and promised to drop diversity, equity and inclusion. The firm — Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison — disputes the administration’s characterization of the agreement, but the deal caused a backlash among many Washington lawyers.\n\nTrump’s broad strategy pulsates with the anti-establishment energy that animated his rowdy campaign rallies, and is part of a deeper attempt to destroy what critics see as a liberal in-crowd that dominates Washington governance and global power in the West with what many conservatives see as more authentic American values. This aspiration lies behind the president’s gutting of the Department of Education, which has long been viewed by Republicans as a tool of Democratic-backed teachers’ unions and a lever for more inclusive gender, race and inclusion policies that many conservatives oppose.\n\nTrump’s choice of education secretary, Linda McMahon — who lacks background in the field but made a fortune promoting theatrical, choreographed bouts of professional wrestling — is itself a rebuke to the education establishment. McMahon explained her mission to downgrade her department to CNN’s Dana Bash Sunday on “State of the Union”: “The Department of Education does not educate one child. It does not establish any curriculum in any states. It doesn’t hire teachers. It doesn’t establish programs,” she said, vowing to send federal funds directly to states.\n\nMcMahon’s appointment springs from the same elite-bashing sentiments that led Trump to name Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic, to head the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nTrump is trying to change America’s culture as well as its politics\n\nTrump’s politics has long been hostile to intellectualism. And a president who was mocked by the establishment for years is now using his second administration to settle scores.\n\nBut his attempt to bring universities, the media and the medical establishment into line is raising fears for academic and press freedom and the sanctity of science in public health. And his ambitions go further — he’s even taken control of the Kennedy Center in Washington, put Fox News anchors on its board and promised to replace high culture with more mainstream programming.\n\nThis is all consistent with a president who draws most support from outside America’s cities and wealthy middle-class suburbs; and who believes he has a mandate for transformation after winning all seven swing states and the popular vote in 2024. It also speaks to the revolution he led in the Republican Party, which has shed its establishment past and now channels working-class constituencies that used to be Democratic.\n\nBut the administration’s latest actions also have dark parallels to the tactics of strongman leaders whose assaults on academia, the media, the law, and business led to the shriveling of basic freedoms, democracy and the proliferation of oligarchical corruption — for instance in Hungary under Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, a hero of the MAGA movement.\n\nTrump’s ultra-nationalist instincts and admiration for dictators such as Russian President Vladimir Putin — a rebuke to generations of US establishment foreign policy directed against Kremlin expansionism — is calling into doubt the international system built by national security elites after World War II and the system of alliances with democracies that are the foundation of US global power.\n\nAnd his administration’s insistence that what it regards as an elite liberal corps of district court judges don’t have the right to interpret the Constitution in a way that constrains the power of an all-powerful president is now encroaching on the rule of law in America, even if the White House is yet to challenge the Supreme Court — perhaps in the belief that its conservative majority will validate some of the president’s own worldview.\n\nHow the MAGA project believes leftist elites compromise American greatness\n\nTrump sketched out his approach in multiple policy areas in his searing inaugural address, which was a statement of intent to ensure his second term will impose the kind of fundamental change that his first failed to enshrine and of the belief that he was “saved by God to make America great again.”\n\nIn Trump’s eyes, that greatness has been compromised by leftist elite policies that shattered domestic manufacturing, suppressed freedom with public health mandates, inflicted radical liberal values in education, allowed unchecked migration, caused weakness abroad and allowed America’s friends to exploit its generosity. “For many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair,” Trump said after he was sworn in.\n\nHis program mirrors the goals of Project 2025, the playbook for conservative presidential leadership that Trump disowned during his campaign but that now helps explain the policy decisions of his administration. “The next conservative president must possess the courage to relentlessly put the interests of the everyday American over the desires of the ruling elite,” Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts wrote in the foreword of the document. “Their outrage cannot be prevented; it must simply be ignored, and it can be.”\n\nThe synergy between Trump’s desire to punish sources of power that he believes have wronged him and the wider administration attempt to neutralize any attempt to neutralize constraints drove his showdown with big law firms Paul, Weiss. The president signed an executive order that suspended security clearances for the firm’s attorneys — a move that could have hampered its capacity to do act in cases that intersect with the federal government. The order was consistent with the president’s attempt to end what he calls the “weaponization” of justice — by targeting lawyers or firms that previously took part in prosecutions against him.\n\nIn a letter to Paul, Weiss employees, the firm’s chairman Brad Karp explained his decision to deal with the president, warning that the executive order could have “easily have destroyed our firm. It brought the full weight of the government down on our firm, our people, and our clients.”\n\nBut the company’s decision provoked wider worries that the president will use his power to threaten law firms with ruin if they act on behalf of his opponents.\n\nAdministration claims liberal judges are illegitimate\n\nTrump’s attempts to bring legal elites in private firms to heel mirror his assault on another establishment the president is trying to disempower — the federal judiciary. This is highlighted by his attacks on a US federal judge who sought to halt deportations of alleged gang members that the White House carried out under the rarely used Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Judge James Boasberg is trying to find out whether the administration flouted his orders to halt the deportations last weekend. His efforts have sparked the extraordinary spectacle of an attorney general directly attacking his legitimacy.\n\n“This is an out-of-control judge, a federal judge trying to control our entire foreign policy. And he cannot do it,” Bondi said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures,” which is presented by Maria Bartiromo — one of the Fox anchors Trump elevated to the board of the Kennedy Center. “They’re not immigrants. They’re illegal aliens who are committing the most violent crimes you can imagine on Americans, murder, rapes,” Bondi said of Venezuelans deported to a draconian El Salvador prison run by dictator Nayib Bukele, which has raised human rights concerns.\n\nThe administration’s use of a national security argument as justification for the deportations, which Trump claims are part of a Venezuelan invasion, may be designed to chill the judge’s attempts to gain clarity. While Bondi said those deported were criminals, the administration has so far not provided any case-by-case details on those involved. CNN has so far been unable to establish that any of the migrants belonged to the Tren de Aragua gang, which the administration said was the reason for the deportations.\n\nTrump’s aides keep arguing that Boasberg is a liberal judge. But he was first appointed by Republican President George W. Bush and then promoted by President Barack Obama. He has a long reputation as a nonpartisan judge. The claims that only Trump-appointed judges are fit to rule on Trump administration policies threaten to destroy the foundation of the legal system.\n\nThe deportations are one of the most prominent examples of the administration’s habit to applying vast executive power in an apparent attempt to outrun the capacity of the courts or its political opponents to impose constraints in real time.\n\nBut the ambition of leaving existing sources of elite power in Washington in tatters runs through all of the administration’s goals — from the seizure of control of the White House press pool from journalists to include pro-Trump outlets to trashing generations of US bipartisan policy with threats to annex Canada while officials repeatedly parrot Russian propaganda on Ukraine.",

        "full_text": "Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino.\n\nLegal experts say there is nothing to President Donald Trump’s claims that several of former President Joe Biden’s pardons are “VOID” because they were signed via autopen.\n\nWhite House lawyers during the George W. Bush administration said the use of an autopen is perfectly legal, and constitutional scholars say that nothing in the Constitution even requires pardons to be signed anyway. And, they note, pardons cannot simply be overturned by a subsequent president.\n\nTrump is correct that pardons would be invalid if, in fact, as he has claimed, any pardons were signed by a staffer without Biden’s knowledge or consent. But Trump has offered no evidence of that.\n\nTrump has repeatedly invoked the autopen issue in the last several days. As NPR explains, autopen is “a generic name for a machine that duplicates signatures using real ink, making it easy for public figures to autograph everything from correspondence to merchandise in bulk. They are printer-sized machines with an arm that can hold a standard pen or pencil, and use it to replicate the programmed signature on a piece of paper below.” Trump acknowledged that he himself uses an autopen, but “only for very unimportant papers.”\n\nIn a post to Truth Social on March 17, Trump claimed that some pardons issued by Biden were “hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen.” He specifically put members of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol on notice that “they are subject to investigation at the highest level.”\n\nBiden’s Late-Term Pardons\n\nOn Jan. 19, a day before he left office, Biden issued a series of preemptive pardons for members of Congress who served on the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack, staff of the committee and law enforcement officials who provided testimony to the committee. (Preemptive pardons are extended to people who have not been formally charged with a crime and are meant to shield them from potential prosecution.) That day, Biden also preemptively pardoned Gen. Mark Milley, Dr. Anthony Fauci and several of Biden’s family members.\n\nBiden has used an autopen in the past, albeit rarely, according to a 2024 CNN story that said staffers flew legislation to South Korea and St. Croix to ensure Biden could personally sign the bills. We could not independently confirm whether the pardons in question were signed via autopen.\n\nTrump has said that members of the Jan. 6 committee — including Rep. Bennie Thompson, who chaired the committee, and then-Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, Republicans on the committee — illegally “destroyed evidence and deleted everything” and “they should be punished.” (As we have written, claims that the committee destroyed “all the evidence” are wrong.)\n\nBut legal scholars say there are several problems with Trump’s claim that using an autopen would nullify these pardons. For starters, they say, presidents don’t need to sign pardons for them to be official.\n\nArticle 2, Section 2, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution states that the president “shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States.” It makes no mention of needing a signature to issue pardons, which stands in contrast to the Constitution’s requirement that a president sign a bill in order to make it a law.\n\n“Nothing in the Constitution requires the president to sign pardons by hand,” Jeffrey Crouch, a professor at American University and author of the book “The Presidential Pardon Power,” told us via email.\n\nA 2024 ruling in a case before the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed. On the question of whether a signature is required for a president to exercise clemency, the court said, “The answer is undoubtedly no. The plain language of the Constitution imposes no such limit, broadly providing that the President ‘shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.’ … The constitutional text is thus silent as to any particular form the President’s clemency act must take to be effective.”\n\nMoreover, Crouch said, “The practice of using an autopen to sign presidential pardons seems perfectly legitimate.”\n\nIndeed, other presidents have used an autopen. Former President Barack Obama was believed to be the first to use it to sign legislation in 2011 when, while in France, he used an autopen to extend the Patriot Act. Then-Rep. Tom Graves, a Republican, wrote Obama a letter asking him to confirm that the bill was “presented” to him “prior to the autopen signing.” We couldn’t find that the White House responded.\n\nA White House Legal Opinion\n\nKermit Roosevelt, a constitutional law professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, told us that the White House Office of Legal Counsel “has opined, based on the original understanding of ‘sign,’ that the president can delegate the act of signing. So autopens are fine.”\n\nIn 2005, the White House Office of Legal Counsel, at the request of then-President George W. Bush, looked into the issue. After a review of the Constitution and other legal opinions, it concluded “that the President need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become law. Rather, the President may sign a bill within the meaning of Article I, Section 7 by directing a subordinate to affix the President’s signature to such a bill, for example by autopen.”\n\n“We emphasize that we are not suggesting that the President may delegate the decision to approve and sign a bill, only that, having made this decision, he may direct a subordinate to affix the President’s signature to the bill,” Howard C. Nielson Jr., deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel, wrote in the legal opinion.\n\nAnd that gets to the second issue Trump raised: whether Biden was aware of or had instructed a subordinate to approve the pardons.\n\nIn a press conference on March 17, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said, “The president was begging the question that I think a lot of journalists in this room should be asking about whether or not the former president of the United States who I think we can all finally agree was cognitively impaired. … But the president was raising the point that did the president [Biden] even know about these pardons? Was his legal signature used without his consent or knowledge? … So I think it’s a question that everybody in this room should be looking into because certainly that would propose perhaps criminal or illegal behavior if staff members were signing the president of the United States’ autograph without his consent.”\n\nIn interviews after his Truth Social post, Trump argued that Biden was “grossly incompetent” and that pardons he signed in his final days in office were “null and void because I’m sure Biden didn’t have any idea that it was taking place.” He acknowledged that ultimately, whether the pardons are illegitimate is “not my decision. That’ll be up to court.”\n\nHowever, neither Trump nor Leavitt has offered any evidence that Biden did not know about or approve the pardons.\n\n“The president can’t delegate the decision of whether to sign, or whether to grant a pardon,” Roosevelt said. “A pardon granted without the president’s knowledge is invalid. But there’s no reason to think that’s what happened here—Biden spoke publicly about the pardons.”\n\nBiden’s Public Comments\n\nWhile we could not find that Biden spoke publicly about the Jan. 19 pardons after they were issued, he did share publicly, in the days preceding the pardons, that he was considering them.\n\nIn an interview on Jan. 5, for example, USA Today’s Susan Page asked Biden, “Some of your supporters have encouraged you to issue preemptive pardons to people like Liz Cheney and Anthony Fauci, who Trump has threatened to target. Will you do that?”\n\n“Well, a little bit of it depends on who he puts in what positions,” Biden said. He said that in a post-election conversation with Trump, “I tried to make it clear that there was no need, and it was counterintuitive for his interest to go back and try to settle scores.” But Biden said Trump did not commit to that.\n\nAnd during remarks on Jan. 10, a reporter asked what pardons Biden was considering in his last 10 days in office.\n\n“One is that it depends on some of the language and expectations that Trump broadcasts in the last couple of days here as to what he’s going to do,” Biden said. “The idea that he would punish people for not adhering to what he thinks should be policy as related to his well-being is outrageous, but there is still consideration of some folks, but no decision.”\n\nThose comments are consistent with a Biden statement released by the White House on Jan. 20 explaining some of his 11th-hour pardons.\n\n“Our nation relies on dedicated, selfless public servants every day. They are the lifeblood of our democracy,” Biden stated. “Yet alarmingly, public servants have been subjected to ongoing threats and intimidation for faithfully discharging their duties.\n\n“In certain cases, some have even been threatened with criminal prosecutions, including General Mark A. Milley, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, and the members and staff of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol,” Biden said. “These public servants have served our nation with honor and distinction and do not deserve to be the targets of unjustified and politically motivated prosecutions.”\n\nMembers of the Jan. 6 committee acted with “integrity and a commitment to discovering the truth,” Biden said. “Rather than accept accountability, those who perpetrated the January 6th attack have taken every opportunity to undermine and intimidate those who participated in the Select Committee in an attempt to rewrite history, erase the stain of January 6th for partisan gain, and seek revenge, including by threatening criminal prosecutions.”\n\n“Even when individuals have done nothing wrong—and in fact have done the right thing—and will ultimately be exonerated, the mere fact of being investigated or prosecuted can irreparably damage reputations and finances,” Biden stated, explaining that this was his reason for issuing the preemptive pardons. “The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that any individual engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense.”\n\nTrump can’t simply revoke pardons issued by Biden, experts told us.\n\n“A completed pardon is not able to be revoked,” Crouch said. “If it was, then any sitting president could try to revoke pardons granted by their predecessors. A president who can undo the clemency decisions of their predecessors would weaken the clemency power for every president.”",

        "full_text": "Yet nearly every key decision remains unsettled. They include how deep to cut into social safety-net spending, how to placate swing-seat lawmakers over a key tax break, how to account for the cost of extending existing tax cuts and how many more breaks they can pile on top.\n\n“How can we be moving quickly when some of those foundational questions haven’t been settled?” North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis said about the rising pressure from the House GOP.\n\nTo help break the deadlock, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and top Trump economic adviser Kevin Hassett are set to huddle again Tuesday with GOP leaders and tax writers as they try to reconcile the two chambers’ diverging plans. On several fronts, the Senate is looking for cues on how to proceed from the House and vice versa, creating a chicken-and-egg situation that has resulted in a quiet standoff between the two chambers.\n\nUnderscoring the firm views on either side, Johnson and other top House GOP leaders issued a joint statement Monday calling on the Senate to “take up the House budget resolution” upon their return to the Capitol. “The American people gave us a mandate and we must act on it,” they said.\n\nThat has many Republicans viewing Johnson’s budget goal — already a retreat from his prior ambition of getting a final bill through the House before Easter — as deeply aspirational. Senate Republicans want to have something to show for all their private deliberations before they leave again in April. Though their leadership has been careful not to offer any public deadlines, a person granted anonymity to discuss internal deliberations said the goal is to adopt a modified budget resolution before the Senate leaves again in three weeks.\n\n“I’d like to have done it yesterday, but really I just don’t find it helpful to set timelines,” said Senate Finance Chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), who is tasked with negotiating the tax portion of the package.\n\nDriving the caution on the Senate side is widespread skepticism among GOP senators that the House can deliver on a bill that meets the budget it adopted last month — particularly its goal of $2 trillion in spending cuts. While House Republicans are prodding their Senate counterparts to just adopt what they sent over, senators have made clear they will make changes.\n\nThey are also wary of going through another marathon voting slog — especially on a framework that will likely require politically perilous Medicaid cuts — without proof that it can result in a passable bill, according to three Republicans involved in the talks who were granted anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\n\nBut there’s a Catch-22: House Republicans, including Johnson’s tax writers on the Ways and Means Committee, don’t intend to draft a bill before the Senate agrees on a fiscal outline.\n\n“How can we do that without knowing the Senate number?” said one House GOP lawmaker granted anonymity to speak candidly.\n\n“That’s not how this works,” a senior House GOP aide concurred.\n\nMeanwhile, the two top leaders are working through unique headaches. Johnson is facing off with conservative hard-liners who not only want the Senate to swallow the House budget whole but are now pushing for a doomed and messy impeachment fight with judges who have ruled against Trump.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, meanwhile, needs to hammer out complex tax disputes among his own members. Republicans are checking in with the nonpartisan parliamentarian — the Capitol Hill official who referees budget policy — on whether they can use a controversial accounting tactic that would allow them to effectively zero out the roughly $4 trillion cost of extending Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. That’s not to mention the widespread heartburn Thune is dealing with inside his conference over the impact of potential Medicaid cuts.\n\nThune and Johnson are in frequent contact, with Johnson publicly floating holding a “little conference” to hammer out the differences between the two chambers. Thune is meeting with small groups of senators to take their temperature, including with members of the tax-writing Finance Committee.\n\nBut frustrations are rising amid what’s likely to be several more months of complex tax discussions.\n\n“Talk, talk, talk, talk,” Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said upon returning to the Capitol from a March 13 White House meeting with Trump and Senate Finance Republicans. “Just like the last 10 weeks.”\n\nWhile many Republicans insist they will eventually get on the same page, there’s no clear plan for how or when that will happen — and plenty of finger-pointing over who is ultimately responsible for doing so.\n\nAdding to the complications is the fact that many rank-and-file House Republicans want senators to rein in their own chamber’s budget plan, despite the calls from their leadership for the Senate to do the opposite.\n\nVulnerable House members said they received assurances from GOP leaders that the level of Medicaid cuts required under the House budget framework wouldn’t make it through the Senate. They made similar assurances regarding the $230 billion in potential cuts to the country’s largest anti-hunger program.\n\nHouse Energy and Commerce Chair Brett Guthrie, whose panel has been tasked with making $880 billion of cuts, said he’s waiting to see what the Senate will do before proposing specific changes to Medicaid or other programs under his jurisdiction.\n\n“We have to have instructions before we can do anything,” he said. “That’s just the system.”\n\nTrump green-lit changes to Medicaid during a meeting with Senate Finance Committee members earlier this month, including mandating work requirements and going after “waste,” according to Republican senators who attended the meeting. But any perceived cuts to benefits stands to spark backlash inside the GOP, and the size of the Energy and Commerce instruction — calibrated to placate House hard-liners — has many doubting those cuts are avoidable.\n\nOn the revenue side, many House tax writers privately acknowledge they need the Senate to modify the House budget blueprint to allow for more priorities that the president continues to push, including income tax exemptions for tips, overtime and Social Security benefits.\n\nGOP members of the House Ways and Means Committee met for two days of meetings to discuss those and a slew of other potential tax provisions before leaving for recess. The group worked through various proposals, using red, yellow and green cards to express their opinions on each one, according to three people granted anonymity to discuss the private meetings.\n\nAmong the longest-running and thorniest issues yet to be resolved: how to placate key blue-state Republicans who want an expansion of the income tax deduction for state and local taxes.\n\nThe array of unsettled disputes has contributed to a sense of bemused frustration among many lawmakers, many of whom are waiting on their leaders — and Trump — to get more aggressive about resolving them.\n\n“Probably what we are going to do is talk each other to death, stare at each other and then eventually, you know, confuse the issue so much that it takes two months to unravel what we agree to,” said GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky.",

        "full_text": "Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) has cautioned GOP colleagues that the Senate isn’t likely to pass President Trump’s border security, energy and tax agenda until July at the earliest, and some Republican senators are warning the bill could drag well into the fall.\n\nMuch of Washington’s attention has focused on the rocky path Trump’s agenda faces in the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson’s (R-La.) slim majority means he can only lose one GOP vote and still pass GOP legislation.\n\nBut Republican senators are warning that getting a major package through the Senate will take months longer than has been publicly discussed, due to the sheer size of Trump’s ambitious agenda and internal Republican divisions over an array of policy questions.\n\nWhile Thune has told Republican senators he wants to move a budget resolution in the “next work period” before the April recess to show progress on Trump’s agenda, the “finished product” is still months away.\n\n“Thune and others have said they don’t think it’s realistic we’ll move the finished product until the end of July,” a Republican senator said of Thune’s projected timeline for moving Trump’s agenda.\n\n“Thune said he thought that the House’s timeline on this was totally unrealistic and that the House doesn’t have their ducks in a row, and their budget resolution has to be completely reworked, and this idea that we do it by April or May is just ridiculous,” the source said.\n\nJohnson said in January that House Republican leaders were “targeting April” for final passage of a budget reconciliation package that would extend the expiring 2017 tax cuts and address border security, energy reform and defense spendings.\n\nJohnson told CNBC in a March 12 interview that he put the reconciliation bill “on a very aggressive timetable for the very important reason that we need to get to the certainty [for the business environment] as soon as possible.”\n\n“I’ve put on an aggressive timetable to try to get a vote on the one big, beautiful bill, the reconciliation package, on the House floor before Easter. If we do that, you’re pushing it over to the Senate for them to act upon — it’s conceivable you could get this to the president’s desk by the end of April or early May. Certainly before Memorial Day,” he said.\n\nRepublican senators, however, say that timeline is totally unrealistic given internal party divisions on tax policy, defense spending and proposed cuts to entitlement spending.\n\nA second Republican senator said Senate Republican leadership has warned that the reconciliation package may not get passed until late July or even September.\n\n“Thune’s been having these small-group discussions, [and] in the one I was in, Senate Republicans were all over the map. There was no consensus,” the GOP senator warned.\n\nThe lawmaker predicted the lack of consensus among Senate Republicans may require the House take the lead to keep Trump’s agenda from being delayed into the fall.\n\n“I’m hoping that the House has a little clearer meeting of the minds than we do,” the source said.\n\nSenate Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said last month that the House-passed budget needed “a major overhaul” before it could pass the Senate.\n\nMost Republican senators support adopting Senate Finance Committee Chair Mike Crapo’s (R-Idaho) strategy of using a “current policy” baseline to estimate the cost of the reconciliation package, which wouldn’t count an extension of the expiring 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as adding to the deficit.\n\nBut there are a few dissenters within the Senate Republican Conference who worry that simply coming up with a way to score an extension of the tax cuts as deficit-neutral wouldn’t accurately reflect the fiscal impact of the legislation.\n\nSemafor reported earlier this month that Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.) have raised questions behind the scenes about using Crapo’s “current policy” baseline to project the cost of the reconciliation package.\n\nCassidy has expressed his concern about projected federal deficits and their impact on interest rates.\n\nIn addition to the disagreement over how to score the extension of the 2017 tax cuts, GOP lawmakers need to decide what additional tax cuts to put in the package.\n\nHouse Republicans from high-income, high-tax blue states want to lift the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions.\n\nAnd earlier this month, Trump renewed his call for Congress to exempt tipped income and Social Security benefits from taxation. Those proposals could cost up to $200 billion and $1.5 trillion over 10 years, respectively.\n\nGraham said he’s still hoping to pass the reconciliation package through the Senate before the August recess.\n\n“I think that’s the goal. I hope so,” he said.\n\nCrapo, who’s leading the negotiations on the tax portion of the package, declined to predict how long the talks might take.\n\n“I can’t tell you how close we are,” he said.\n\nAnother major stumbling block is the instruction in the House-passed budget resolution to the House Energy and Commerce Committee to reduce the federal deficit by $880 billion over 10 years.\n\nBudget experts say that while the language does not mention Medicaid specifically, the only way to meet that target is to make huge cuts to the program, which pays for the medical services of low-income and disabled people, as well as nursing home costs for many seniors.\n\nRepublican senators including Sens. Josh Hawley (Mo.), John Boozman (Ark.) and Jim Justice (W.Va.) have either expressed opposition to deep Medicaid cuts or have emphasized the importance of the program to many of their constituents.\n\n“I would not do severe cuts to Medicaid,” Hawley told HuffPost in February.\n\n“I don’t like the idea of massive Medicaid cuts,” he said.\n\nBoozman told The Hill that Medicaid cuts “sure would” impact constituents in Arkansas.\n\n“It depends what they’re going to do,” he said, noting the House-passed budget resolution doesn’t detail explicitly what mandatory spending programs will be cut.\n\n“We don’t have $800 billion in cuts in play right now. It’s what the House wants to do,” he said. “What I’ll be concerned about is the final negotiated process, which we’re a long way from.”\n\nJustice told reporters Thursday that many West Virginians depend on Medicaid but added that he would support reforms that strengthen the solvency of the program.\n\n“From the standpoint of Medicaid, West Virginia has a gigantic participation. Really and truly we have concerns, and we’re going to have to watch as this thing filters all the way through,” he said of the reconciliation package.\n\n“At the same time, we know there’s waste like we can’t imagine,” he said. “We can try as best we possibly can to make the right moves on the chessboard to fix it or to make it better.”\n\nDefense spending is a third major point of disagreement.\n\nThe House-passed budget proposal calls for a $100 billion direct spending increase for defense needs, but Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) says that’s inadequate to build up the defense industrial base to meet the growing threat posed by China and other adversaries.\n\nWicker wants the reconciliation package to include at least $175 billion for defense programs.\n\nHe said he voted for the continuing resolution to fund the government until Sept. 30 despite what he saw as its failure to meet the Pentagon’s needs, because of the expectation that the reconciliation package would make up for the shortfall.\n\n“We’re going to need more than $150 billion in the reconciliation bill, if we’re going to be able to defend the country,” he said. “It needs to be well over $150 billion. We’re looking north of $175 [billion].”",

        "full_text": "Pity poor John Roberts. No, he’s not corrupt or compromised. He is simply a man who has found himself at a pivotal time and place in a position of great responsibility for which he is utterly unsuited. He’s not a dumb man. He is, in fact, a very smart man – Hugh Hewitt knew him personally in the Reagan administration and testifies to that. I have no doubt it’s true. I know many smart people who have similar flaws. As objectively intelligent as John Roberts is, he is unwise, and he is endangering the institution he wants to preserve because he does not understand human nature or the times he finds himself in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrankly, I’ll take wisdom over raw intellect any day of the week.\n\nIf he had the capacity to lead that he so manifestly lacks, John Roberts could save his institution with decisive and bold action. But that’s not who he is. Understand what John Roberts wants. He is an institutionalist who has always wanted to protect the judiciary branch. He wants it to be a fully co-equal branch that is respected by all. But the veryactions he has chosen to take – or not to take – in response to the current crisis of out-of-control subordinate courts are guaranteeing that it will fall.\n\nArticle III of our Constitution provides for the judicial branch, but it does notexpresslyprovide the judiciary with any powers other than those it earns in the eyes of the other two branches.It cannot self-enforce its decrees.Article I creates the Congress, and the legislative branch has both the power of the purse and the power to impeach to check the judiciary. Article II establishes the presidency, but the Constitution does not specify its checks and balances over the court. That power is implied, and the implied power is for the executive – who runs the machinery of the federal government, including the cogs and gears that carry guns – to simply say “No” to an out-of-control judiciary. This implied power of defiance is as much a check and balance as any enumerated one, and without it, you would have an unchecked judiciary with hundreds of district court judges presuming to micromanage the legitimate actions of the executive branch.\n\nYou know, kind of like what’s happening now.\n\nJudge Roberts’s problem is that he wants to return to something like regular order in the judiciary. What we have is highly irregular order. You non-lawyers need to understand that all these temporary restraining orders and injunctions and so forth are insane. This is not how law is done, either procedurally or substantively. I did litigation for 30 years, including in federal courts (up to arguing in front of the Ninth Circuit), and never saw anything remotely like these antics. So, realize that this is abnormal.\n\nAbnormal times call for abnormal responses, but that’s not how John Roberts or his ilk work. Remember, he’s a Bushie, the kind of soft Republican who sees his job less asfixing our broken government than managing its gentlemanly decline. We’ve largely booted them out of elective office, but Roberts has his seat for life. His advocation is protecting his institution. He wants the judiciary to be held in respect and obeyed, but he doesn’t want to do the hard, stern work of disciplining his underlings that makes that possible.\n\nJohn Roberts wants the normal appellate procedures to apply. He’s hoping that if he shuts his eyes and pretends that everything is normal, he’ll open them and it will all be normal again. This was the main takeaway from his unbelievably tone-deaf response to Trump’s, Musk’s, and others’ frustration-driven talk about impeachment. Now, Roberts was right in theory about what he said, but what we’re facing is not theory but practice. Putaside the practical reality that we’re not going to be able to impeach anybody, and don’t fall for the Internet amateur ambulance chasers who think there’s one neat trick where we can somehow get rid of judges by a majority vote because of “bad behavior.” That is a reason to get rid of them, not a means. The means is impeachment, and that takes 67 senators. That’s never going to happen so we should stop talking about it.They would wear a failed impeachment like Tim Walz would have worn his war medals if he had shown up to earn any.Haven’t we learned not to engage in failure theater?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn normal times, the response toa judge over one dumb decision is the appellate process. But these are not normal times. These are not one dumb decision. These are dozens of dumb decisions. And the answer here is not the appellate process because the appellate process is long, drawn out, and deliberate. The goal of this campaign is to use that delay to effectively strip Donald Trump of the ability to govern. To that end, they have sought towrap him up in aweb of orders and injunctions that will prevent him fromdoing the things he was elected to do. If it was one case or ten cases, you could wait months and months for the appellate process to grind through.Eventually,Trump administration will win most of these cases through the appellate process because they’re procedurally and substantively ridiculous. But the purpose of these judicial antics is not to fulfill the letter of the law, but to create friction that improperly prevents political actions that the executive has the right to take. In other words, Donald Trump may live in the White House, but he can’t actually be President, thereby disenfranchising the people who elected him.\n\nSo, we have a system that is not being used normally and that is not being used for a normal purpose. But Chief Justice Roberts, in his lack of wisdom, refuses to see that abnormal actions sometimes require abnormal responses. As I have said before, he will never be able to normal the abnormal back to normality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe thinks he can force normality back onto the judiciary by simply pretending the abnormality doesn’t exist and that everything is hunky-dory. He can’t. He must force normality back onthe judiciary by addressing the abnormality directly. That means he has to take abnormal actions in response. Procedurally, he needs to lead the charge to stop the imposition and use of these bizarre nationwide orders and injunctions by giving the circuit courts of appeal clear guidance to end this nonsense. Substantively, he needs to direct the circuit courts to issue stays on district court orders that far exceed the scope of the judiciary’s proper powers. And if the circuit courts of appeal refuse to do that, then the Supreme Court needs to issue the orders to enforce its will, even if that means issuing dozens and dozens of orders. The Supreme Court only takes 50 or socases a year. With over 100 lawsuits against the Trump administration as part of this lawfare campaign, that workload no longer works.\n\nWhat John Roberts is risking by refusing to put an end to these abuses is the Trump administration putting an end to these abuses by exercising its implied power under the Constitution to check an out-of-control judiciary. If an order issues and no one enforces it, is it really an order?\n\nJohn Roberts is running out of friends. The leftists hate him. They’ll tolerate him as long as he’s useful, but he’s not going to find any political support on the Democrat side when they come back into power. He’s got a little in the tank left on the right, but if he keeps this up, he’s going to be running on empty. Roberts still thinks that he can dip his toe into politics to protect his institution (see, e.g., his ridiculous, political Obamacare opinion), but he hasn’t thought through how he can do that without any friends to back him up when the executive pushes back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt some point, unless Robert puts a stop to this misconduct, Trump will simply refuse to obey. And when he does, he will ensure it is over some utterly outrageous order where he is acting both at the height of his Article II powers (like on some issue that involves command of the military or protecting America from foreign terrorists and gangsters) and at the height of his political power (like on some issue where he’s on the 80% side of an 80/20 split). He will resist from strength, while the judiciary fulminates impotently from weakness.\n\nLots of people are asking why Trump is not defying the courts now. It’s because he doesn’t have to. The Department of Justice under Pam Bondi is doing an incredible jobof litigating these cases – I’ve read a lot of briefs over the years, and the DOJ lawyers are writing terrific ones. The Administration is passively aggressively obeying these orders, being very picayune and literal in its interpretation of them, but it is not outright defying them. Nor should it. Outright defiance of a court order is another 80/20 issue, but 80% of normals right now believe the President should obey court orders. That will change if this keeps up and as Trump highlights the abuses, but right now, America is not politically ready for that fight, and Trump doesn’t need topull the trigger yet.\n\nYet.\n\nBut John Roberts better understands that if it comes to obeying the courts or neutering the executive branch and defying the will of the people, as expressed in the last election, the courts are going to lose. They don’t have any cops. They don’t have any Army divisions. All they have is their respect, and John Roberts’s underlings are busy squandering it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSadly, so far, John Roberts has shown no indication that he is wise enough to put a stop to this runaway train of out-of-control judicial election interference. He believes he’s acting to protect the judicial branch. He is not. His George Costanza-like gut instinct is always wrong. He would be better off interrogating his gut and then doing precisely the opposite.\n\nA decision point is coming. Decisive actionby the Chief Justicecould save the judicial branch byrestoring the judicial modesty that preserves the respect of the other branches. If only we could be confident that John Roberts was wise enough to do it.\n\nFollow Kurt on Twitter @KurtSchlichter.

        "full_text": "Walt Disney Studios’s new \"Snow White\" film is having a tough opening weekend.\n\nNot only is the film projected to have the lowest opening weekend among the studio’s live-action remakes so far, the movie is getting bombarded with bad reviews.\n\n\"The movie does earn points as a bedtime story, however, because it will definitely put you to sleep,\" Rolling Stone critic David Fear quipped in his review.\n\n'SNOW WHITE' REBOOT STAR, WHO KNOCKED 1937 FILM, IS 'THANKFUL' FOR CRITICS: 'MAKES ME FEEL LIKE TEFLON'\n\nThe film, a retread of the original 1937 animated classic, currently has a \"rotten\" 44% critics score from movie review aggregator site RottenTomatoes.com. Though audiences appear to have a more favorable view of the movie — the audience score sits at 74% — mainstream film critics have savaged the movie.\n\nThe New York Times’ chief film critic Manohla Dargis summed up her impressions of the film, saying it’s \"neither good enough to admire nor bad enough to joyfully skewer; its mediocrity is among its biggest bummers.\"\n\nKyle Smith at The Wall Street Journal wrote, \"Gloss prevails over heart in nearly every scene, and plot beats feel contrived,\" and The Boston Globe’s Odie Henderson lamented, \"I had high hopes that ‘Snow White’ would make me happy. Instead, this dopey remake made me sleepy and grumpy.\"\n\n\"Presumably one of the reasons to bring actors into remakes of animated classics would be to add a warm-blooded pulse to these characters. Zegler manages that, but everyone else in ‘Snow White’ - mortal or CGI - is as stiff as could be,\" The Associated Press said about the film.\n\nThe Guardian chief film critic Wendy Ide gave the film one star out of five and called it \"toe-curlingly terrible.\" She said that it’s \"A film made by people with cartoon dollar signs for eyes and not even the tiniest glimmer of art in their souls,\" and added that it’s \"a bamboo-splinters-under-the-fingernails viewing experience.\"\n\nPETER DINKLAGE CRITICIZES 'SNOW WHITE' REMAKE'S PUSH FOR DIVERSITY: 'IT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME'\n\nVanity Fair chief critic Richard Lawson wrote in his review on Friday, \"Hm? What’s that? This Snow White is not a made-for-TV movie shot in Burbank but is instead a theatrically released feature film that cost upwards of $250 million to make? Oh. Oh dear.\"\n\nHollywood outlet Deadline.com reported on Sunday that the film is projected to earn around $43 million this weekend, which puts it under Disney’s live-action remake of \"Dumbo.\" The 2019 film holds the title for the lowest box-office numbers of the live-action remakes of Disney's animated classics — earning $46 million.\n\nDisney’s \"Snow White\" remake could be said to be a bigger box-office bomb than \"Dumbo,\" as it cost $270 million to make, as opposed to the latter’s $170 million.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe film's controversy-filled production period may have contributed to its poor box office reception so far. In the three years leading up to \"Snow White's\" release, a year-long delay, Disney's apparent flip-flop on making the film's \"dwarfs\" depiction more politically correct, Zegler's bashing of the original film's traditional themes and her public demonization of Trump supporters, appeared to have soured the film before it even came out.",

        "full_text": "At this point, Disney’s live-action princesses should be able to sue for damages. Snow White, like The Little Mermaid before it, has thrust a promising new star into the centre of a lazily conceived, visually repellent remake, depending entirely on her talents to drive its machine. But it’s offered her nothing in return – not on screen nor support behind the scenes, considering our new Ariel and Snow White, Halle Bailey and Rachel Zegler respectively, are both women of colour targeted by rampant racist abuse online.\n\nZegler, like Bailey, was born for a role like this. She’s a classic theatre kid, bouncing off her first onscreen role as Maria in Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story to give us a wide-eyed, deeply earnest Snow. There’s a touch of Judy Garland in how she delivers the character’s new signature power ballad, “Waiting on a Wish”, with a beautifully clear voice and dreamy naivety.\n\nBut “Waiting on a Wish”, while the catchiest of the new tracks provided by The Greatest Showman’s Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, is also a perfect case study of Disney’s increasingly procedural attitude towards its live-action remakes. It’s a highly produced, machine-like approximation of a Disney song, created to fill the gap left by the 1937 original’s “I’m Wishing”, banished in fear of the implication that this princess is still waiting around for a man to give her purpose.\n\nOut, too, goes the majority of the narrative, replaced by a few buzzwords about bravery and being a father’s daughter. They never amount to anything beyond the lesson that good leaders always remember people’s names (sure, but are there not more inspiring lessons to be taught than basic etiquette?) Still in are the necessary nostalgic trademarks: the Evil Queen (Gal Gadot) and her magic mirror, the poisoned apple, and the seven dwarves.\n\nOf course, Disney is well aware of how troubling it is to characterise people with dwarfism as fairytale denizens. However, instead of using this as an opportunity to dismantle stereotypes through a reimagined narrative and platform seven actors with dwarfism in the process, the studio has summoned up the most corporate response possible. Human beings have been replaced with uncanny CGI caricatures that will make you yearn for the simple horrors of 2004’s The Polar Express. There are two actors with dwarfism in the cast – Martin Klebba voices Grumpy, while George Appleby plays an unrelated role – but neither are given the spotlight they deserve.\n\nDirector Marc Webb and cinematographer Mandy Walker struggle to impose any visual coherence between scenes shot on location and inside a studio. Characters will suddenly emerge from a colour-drained, flatly lit bit of woodland into a caramelised, abrasively artificial recreation of (supposedly) that same woodland. The Evil Queen is dripping in sequins and costume jewellery, which would suggest the anticipation of a camp performance, only to receive not a drop of that in return (Gadot’s involvement in organising screenings of an IDF-produced film about 7 October has led to calls from activists to boycott the film).\n\nThe film’s prince, played by Andrew Burnap and, for some reason, called Jonathan, is essentially Disney cannibalising itself, as he has the same thief backstory and curtain bangs as Tangled’s Flynn Rider. There’s self-cannibalisation at work, too, in Sandy Powell’s costumes, which are dour replicas of their animated counterparts. At times, Zegler’s bob leans dangerously close to “little Dutch boy”. What’s most disheartening about it all is how predictable Disney’s choices have become. With Snow White, they’ve finessed their formula – do the bare minimum to make a film, then simply slap a bunch of cutesy CGI animals all over it and hope no one notices.\n\nDir: Marc Webb. Starring: Rachel Zegler, Gal Gadot, Andrew Burnap, Ansu Kabia, Patrick Page. PG, 109 minutes.\n\n‘Snow White’ is in cinemas from 21 March",

In St John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Carney addressed the threat of US tariffs, repeating a favoured sporting analogy: \"In this trade war, just like in hockey, we will win.\"\n\nSpeaking in Ottawa earlier that day, Carney said he needed a clear, positive mandate to deal with Trump.\n\n\"We are facing the most significant crisis of our lifetimes because of President Trump's unjustified trade actions and his threats to our sovereignty,\" he said.\n\nIn a rally of his own in Toronto on Sunday evening, Poilievre said Carney's party was failing to offer change, and simply \"making the same promises that they've been breaking for over 10 years\".\n\nThe Liberals – once written off for this election - now have a chance of forming a government for the fourth consecutive time under Carney.\n\nCarney, 60, the former governor of the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada, has never served as an MP and is untested politically.\n\nCarney made the most of his short days in office, meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron and stopping in Canada's Arctic to announce a partnership with Australia to develop a new northern radar system.\n\nHe also ended Trudeau's signature carbon tax climate policy, which had faced heavy criticism by the Conservatives.\n\nNow he will face the general electorate, which is concerned about Canada's rapidly shifting relationship with the US, its historically close ally, as well as the country's high cost of living.\n\nIn a campaign launch shortly before the election call, Poilievre, 45, sought to link Carney to the Liberals under Trudeau, who left office as a deeply unpopular leader. He called Trudeau's time in office a \"lost Liberal decade\".\n\nHe accused the party of weakening the country by blocking resource development, failing to fund the military, and mismanaging immigration and the economy, saying its \"post-national globalist ideology\" made Canada more vulnerable to Trump's trade war.\n\nPresident Trump's current and threatened tariffs on Canadian goods could usher in economic instability in the country and push Canada towards a recession.\n\nTrump placed 25% tariffs on Canadian goods on 2 March before partially pausing them for a month. On 12 March, a blanket 25% duty on all aluminium and steel imports went into effect, hitting Canadian importers.\n\nThe Trump administration plans further global tariffs on 2 April, in the campaign's second week.\n\nCanada has retaliated so far with tariffs on about C$60bn ($42bn; £32bn) worth of US goods.\n\nCarney on Sunday called the trade war with the US one of the \"most significant threats of our lifetimes\".\n\nReferring to Trump, he said: \"He wants to break us so America will own us. We will not let that happen.\"\n\nCarney has promised further retaliation, though he has conceded there is a limit to Canada's tariff response given the different size of the two economies.\n\nPoilievre said that Canada must respond firmly to threats from the White House.\n\n\"We have to convert our anger and our anxiety into action,\" he said. \"We have to become strong, self-reliant and sovereign to stand up to the Americans.\"\n\nThe campaign will last just five weeks - the shortest allowed. Besides the US-Canada relationship, much of the focus will be on the economy, including cost-of-living issues.",

She was married to Donald Trump Jr. for 12 years. They had five children together.\n\nWoods announced March 11 that he ruptured his left Achilles tendon, knocking him out of the Masters and likely for the rest of the year.\n\nIt was not clear what prompted Woods, who keeps his personal life fiercely private, to publish photos confirming the relationship. It was reminiscent of 2013, when he and Lindsey Vonn both posted photos of them together to confirm they were dating.\n\nWoods said at the time he and Vonn “wanted to limit the ‘stalkarazzi’ and all those sleazy websites that are out there following us,” saying it could lead to dangerous situations involving his children. He also said their photos would devalue anything the paparazzi had.\n\nWoods has two children from his marriage to Elin Nordegren, who divorced him 2010 after he had been exposed for multiple extramarital affairs.\n\nHis only other public relationship was with Erica Herman, which lasted about seven years until he ended it in October 2022. It was a messy split, and Herman eventually dismissed lawsuits against Woods and the trust that owns his south Florida estate, where she had been living.\n\n___",

She was 49.\n\nHer family confirmed the death in a post on one of Ms. Love’s social media pages. She had been diagnosed in 2022 with a glioblastoma, an aggressive type of brain tumor.\n\nMs. Love’s parents immigrated to the United States from Haiti in the 1970s and settled in Brooklyn, where she was born. Her family later moved to Norwalk, Conn., where she attended high school. After graduating from the University of Hartford, she held a series of jobs, including flight attendant.\n\nShe eventually settled in Utah, where she joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Ms. Love began her political career fighting a mosquito problem in Saratoga Springs, Utah. She later became the city’s mayor.\n\nWhen she was elected to Congress in 2014, she made history as the first Black Republican woman to take on the role. She was viewed as a rising Republican star, and was the sole Republican member of the Congressional Black Caucus during her term, making her an uncommon symbol of bipartisanship in an era of deep division.\n\nShe frequently criticized President Trump’s positions, including on immigration, during his first term in office. She did not seek his endorsement during her re-election campaign in 2018 and lost her seat by less than a percentage point to Democratic challenger Ben McAdams.",

        "full_text": "(NewsNation) — As the battle over President Donald Trump’s executive order ending birthright citizenship heats up, the administration is cracking down on an underground industry in California where Chinese nationals pay money to baby brokers who get pregnant Chinese women into the country so their babies are born U.S. citizens.\n\nOfficials say these couples are often housed in luxury apartments or large mansions in the suburbs of Los Angeles, which neighbors call “baby farms.”\n\nIllegal Chinese birthing agencies organize the trips and charge upwards of $100,000.\n\nThe practice is nothing new, and crackdowns on these operations date back at least a decade.\n\nCalifornia hotels report seeing many Chinese pregnant women\n\nActing U.S. Attorney Joseph McNally says that this “system” birthed 30,000 Chinese babies into U.S. citizenship.\n\n“These were criminal enterprises that operated here in the United States and also people in China who would recruit,” he said. “The organizers here had contacts at hospitals and had contacts there. It was an industry. The organizers of these schemes were responsible for the birth tourism of thousands of babies. They had a system in place.”\n\nArea hotels and motels have reported seeing a number of Chinese pregnant women who would come and stay for months until giving birth.\n\n‘Rent a womb’ not illegal, but concerning: Attorney\n\nAnother popular option for more wealthy Chinese couples is the so-called “rent a womb,” where they pay American women to be surrogates. When Chinese babies are born from an American woman, they are automatically U.S. citizens but immediately return home to China.\n\nMcNally says it’s not illegal, but it’s a grave concern.\n\n“Anytime somebody has a U.S. passport, it means they have access to the United States,” he said.\n\nHe cited a case where a child born in Irvine in 2015 to a Chinese national went back and joined the Chinese military at age 20 but still had a U.S. passport.\n\n“That provides a real national security asset to China. And a real problem to the United States,” McNally said.\n\nClients pay around $200K to use US wombs at egg donor institute\n\nParham Zar, owner of the Egg Donor and Surrogacy Institute in Beverly Hills, said at one point, 90% of their clients were Chinese.\n\nBut he pushed back, saying the practice is not always ill-intentioned.\n\n“It is a misnomer in this field that people are just coming here to be a U.S. citizen,” he said. “I haven’t met anyone who had nefarious intentions of having a child. It takes a lot of time, effort and money to go through this process.”\n\nZar said clients pay about $200,000 for the surrogacy process to use American wombs.\n\nTrump signed executive order to end birthright citizenship\n\nIn January, President Trump signed a controversial executive order trying to end birthright citizenship.\n\nWhile it’s an uphill battle that requires changing the Constitution, it’s sparked a discussion that has exposed how birthright citizenship could be abused. Republican Congresswoman Harriet Hageman of Wyoming is sounding alarms.\n\n“Because of advances in technology, lax surrogacy laws, and the incorrect understanding of the 14th Amendment, countries are now using international surrogacy programs to rent wombs in America,” she said.\n\n“I found it to be incredibly strange and dystopian,” she added.\n\n“I just think we need to be having a national dialogue as to whether we think this is ethical, whether we think that this is appropriate. Whether we should be interpreting our own laws to be allowing the buying and selling of children essentially or the buying and selling of wombs.”",

        "full_text": "Three members of the punk band, the UK Subs – including Iggy Pop’s bass player Alvin Gibbs – were denied entry into the US.\n\nThe musicians are the latest foreign nationals to run into trouble with immigration at US airports since Donald Trump entered office.\n\nThe UK Subs, who have toured the US previously without incident, were due to perform at a punk festival in Los Angeles and flew into LAX.\n\nWriting on Facebook, Gibbs, 67, said: “After an 11-hour flight, my partner Roz and I arrived at the immigration booth. Roz was waved through without issue, but I was told that something had flagged up, necessitating further questioning.\n\n“There were two reasons given: first, they claimed I did not have the correct visa for entry; second, there was another unspecified issue that they refused to disclose.\n\n“I can’t help but wonder whether my frequent, and less than flattering, public comments regarding their president and his administration played a role — or perhaps I’m simply succumbing to paranoia.”\n\n“What followed was far from pleasant,” he added. The band members were taken to a holding pen.\n\n‘No sleep for well over a day’\n\n“My luggage, phone, and passport were confiscated. Hours later, at 4am (having landed at 7pm), I was called for a second interview,” he added.\n\n“By the time we were escorted onto the flight at 8pm the next day, I had gone without sleep for well over a day, surviving only on a pot noodle and a couple of cups of tea.\n\n“If that wasn’t enough, United Airlines policy dictated that I was not allowed a single alcoholic drink on the flight, given the circumstances of my deportation.”\n\nIn Los Angeles, band member Charlie Harper – who was allowed into the country – found three local musicians to fill in for the gig.\n\nA French academic claims they denied him entry into the US because of anti-Trump material on his mobile phone and a 28-year-old British backpacker was held for 19 days in a detention centre after authorities said her visa was improper.\n\nAnother incident has seen a 34-year-old German green card holder – who has lived legally in the US since he was a teenager detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after returning from a brief trip abroad.\n\n‘No right to privacy’\n\nIn recent days both the UK Foreign Office and the German foreign ministry have updated their advice to travellers visiting the US, now warning of the danger of detention if failing to comply with immigration rules.\n\nRosanna Berardi, an immigration lawyer, said there had been a change in approach to foreign visitors since Mr Trump took office.\n\n“They have the power to search, they have the power to seize, there are no rights to anything at a US border crossing, no right to a lawyer, no right to privacy,” she told The Telegraph.\n\n“That’s always been the case however what we’re seeing is the pendulum swing to a very, very aggressive position on these issues,” she added.\n\n“Now I would still argue that their behaviour is extremely aggressive, but they do have a lot of things in their computer system with respect to background checks and criminality and sometimes people show up at an airport or the border they don’t have the right paperwork.\n\n“With the musical bands that happens a lot, so I think there’s a host of things going on, but I think the message from this administration is, very loudly and very clearly, we are going to look at every person microscopic lately and the ease to which it used to be to enter the United States is in the rear-view mirror.”\n\n‘Increased scrutiny’\n\nChristi Hufford Jackson, an immigration lawyer with Laura Devine, told The Telegraph that there are typically valid reasons for border agents to intervene but there appears to have been a ratcheting up of their approach since Mr Trump returned to the White House.\n\n“They are clearly combing records to deny entry. There is increased scrutiny.\n\n“I think there are people being held in custody for simple transgressions, which is historically unusual.\n\n“There has been an escalation in how they are dealing with denials of entry.”\n\nJason Sullivan, a New Hampshire immigration lawyer, told The Telegraph: “During this time of increased enforcement of US immigration law, it is essential that immigration officials, including US Customs and Border Protection, remain committed to upholding due process.\n\n“Ensuring fair treatment, due process, and equal protection for all individuals is critical to preserving justice and the integrity of the immigration system.”\n\nThe Telegraph has approached Customs and Border Protection for comment.",

        "full_text": "Fierce protests in Turkey after Erdogan rival jailed\n\n11 hours ago\n\nEmily Wither & Maia Davies\n\nBBC News, in Istanbul and London\n\nTens of thousands of protesters have taken part in demonstrations across Turkey after the main rival to the country's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was formally arrested and charged with corruption.\n\nEkrem Imamoglu, the mayor of Istanbul, was due to be selected as the Republican People's Party's (CHP) 2028 presidential nominee in a vote on Sunday.\n\nIn response to his arrest, Sunday night saw a ramping up of the worst unrest the country has seen in more than a decade - with protesters fired upon with tear gas and rubber bullets.\n\nImamoglu said the allegations against him are politically motivated. \"I will never bow,\" he wrote on X before he was remanded in custody.\n\nErdogan has condemned the demonstrations and accused the CHP of trying to \"disturb the peace and polarise our people\".\n\nCrowds amassed near Istanbul's city hall by early evening on Sunday for a fifth night and could be seen waving Turkish flags and chanting in front of a row of riot police.\n\nOfficers were seen firing water cannons at some protesters and using pepper spray.\n\nImamoglu's wife Dilek Kaya Imamoglu addressed the large crowds outside the city hall, telling demonstrators that the \"injustice\" her husband has faced has \"struck a chord with every conscience\".\n\nThe demonstrations in response to Imamoglu's arrest are the largest the country has seen since the Gezi protests of 2013, which began in Istanbul over the demolition of a local park.\n\nIn total, rallies took place in at least 55 of Turkey's 81 provinces, or more than two-thirds of the country, according to a tally by French news agency AFP.\n\nImamoglu was one of more than 100 people, including other politicians, journalists and businessmen, detained as part of an investigation on Wednesday.\n\nHe was formally arrested on Sunday and charged with \"establishing and managing a criminal organisation, taking bribes, extortion, unlawfully recording personal data and rigging a tender\".\n\nHe was remanded in custody pending trial. AFP and local media reported he had been taken to a prison in Silivri.\n\nImamoglu has also been suspended from his post as mayor, Turkey's interior ministry said in a statement.\n\nIn social media posts, Imamoglu criticised his arrest as a \"black stain on our democracy\" and said judicial procedure was not being followed.\n\nHe urged people across the country to join protests and take part in Sunday's vote.\n\nIn a message shared on X through his lawyers late on Sunday, Imamoglu sent his greetings to those protesting and said that voters had showed Turkey had \"enough\" of Erdogan.\n\nImamoglu was the only person running in the CHP's presidential candidate selection.\n\nThe arrest does not prevent Imamoglu's candidacy and election as president, but if he is convicted of any of the charges against him, he will not be able to run.\n\nImamoglu's CHP party said nearly 15 million people cast a ballot on Sunday.\n\nThe CHP said some 1.6 million votes came from its members, while the rest were cast by non-members at separate ballot boxes for those who wished to show solidarity with Imamoglu.\n\nThe BBC cannot independently verify these figures.\n\nWaiting to cast her ballot, 38-year-old Aslihan told AFP: \"We won't give in to despair\".\n\nIn a post on X, Imamoglu's wife shared pictures of herself casting her vote and urged the country to vote for \"democracy, justice and the future\".\n\nThe jailed politician is seen as one of the most formidable rivals of Erdogan, who has held office in Turkey for 22 years as both prime minister and president.\n\nHowever, due to term limits, Erdogan cannot run for office again in 2028 unless he changes the constitution.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice has criticised those connecting Erdogan to the arrests, and insist on its judicial independence.\n\nOn Sunday, X's Global Government Affairs department said it objected to \"multiple court orders\" from Turkey's communications regulator to block over 700 accounts on the platform, including those of Turkish political figures and journalists.\n\nX said the move was \"not only unlawful, it hinders millions of Turkish users from news and political discourse in their country\".\n\nMeanwhile, Istanbul University announced on Tuesday it was revoking Imamoglu's degree due to alleged irregularities.\n\nIf upheld, this would put his ability to run as president into doubt, since the Turkish constitution says presidents must have completed higher education to hold office.\n\nImamoglu's lawyers said they would appeal the decision to revoke his degree to the Constitutional Court and the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nThe Supreme Election Council will decide whether Imamoglu is qualified to be a candidate.",

She was 43.\n\nPolice in Alexandria, Virginia, were called to a home on Beverly Drive in the suburb of Washington, D.C., at around 9:18 a.m. for the report of an unresponsive woman, according to a police statement. They found Aber dead inside.\n\nPolice said an investigation is underway surrounding the circumstances of her death.\n\nTwo sources close to the investigation told ABC News that the death appears to be from natural causes. At this point there is no indication of foul play, the sources added.\n\nA friend of the family told ABC News on Sunday that police believe the death was the result of a longstanding medical issue.\n\nHowever, officials are still awaiting a formal report as to the cause and manner of her death from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.\n\nAber, who served as U.S. attorney in Virginia for most of the Biden administration, took office in October 2021 after being unanimously confirmed by the Senate and stepped down in January, shortly after President Donald Trump's inauguration.\n\nAs U.S. attorney, Aber oversaw a staff of some 300 prosecutors and other staff and handled federal prosecutions in the state.\n\nShe started working in the office in 2009 as an assistant U.S. attorney, prosecuting financial fraud, public corruption, violent crime and child exploitation cases, according to an online biography.\n\nShe received her law degree from William and Mary Law School in 2006.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi shared a statement on X on Saturday night, writing: \"The loss of Jessica Aber, former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, is deeply tragic. Our hearts and prayers go out to her family and friends during this profoundly difficult time.\"\n\n\"We are heartbroken beyond words to learn of the passing of our friend and former colleague, U.S. Attorney Jessica Aber,\" current U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Erik Siebert said in a statement. \"She was unmatched as a leader, mentor, and prosecutor, and she is simply irreplaceable as a human being. We remain in awe of how much she accomplished in her all too brief time in this world.\"\n\nCalling her a \"proud Virginian from high school through college and throughout her career,\" Siebert's statement went on to say: \"Her professionalism, grace, and legal acumen set the standard. Though we are devastated by this loss, each of us in the Eastern District of Virginia (EDVA) will look to her example and endeavor to live up to that standard.\"\n\nIn a statement, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares said he was saddened to learn of her death, saying her \"career of public service included US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia and whose work with Ceasefire Virginia saved more lives than we may ever realize.\"\n\nHe added, \"Our thoughts and our prayers are with her family this week.\"\n\nABC News' Alexandra Faul contributed to this report.",

        "full_text": "President Donald Trump has rescinded an executive order targeting a prestigious international law firm after it promised to abandon diversity policies and provide $40m (£31m) worth of free legal work to support White House initiatives.\n\nPaul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP is a multinational law firm headquartered in New York that has many high-profile clients.\n\nTrump's 14 March order had terminated federal contracts with the firm and suspended security clearances for its lawyers, saying it was undermining the US judicial system.\n\nThe firm is now facing blowback from many in the legal community, including a top lawyer for Democrats, even as some lawyers said it had few other options.\n\nTrump has issued similar executive orders against the law firms Perkins Coie and Covington & Burling.\n\nThe White House rescinded the order on Thursday after a meeting between Trump and Brad Karp, the chairman of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Garrison & Wharton.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, the president said the firm had agreed to a series of concessions, including the promise to provide \"the equivalent of $40 million in pro bono legal services over the course of President Trump's term to support the Administration's initiatives\".\n\nIt added that Paul Weiss would commit to \"merit-based\" hiring and promotion, and \"will not adopt, use, or pursue any DEI policies\".\n\nTrump's order last week had cancelled contracts with the firms citing Trump's orders to wipe out any initiatives aimed at Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) within the federal government.\n\nThe Truth Social post also included a statement from Mr Karp, who said: \"We are gratified that the President has agreed to withdraw the Executive Order concerning Paul, Weiss. We look forward to an engaged and constructive relationship with the President and his Administration.\"\n\nMany in the legal community have expressed outrage over the deal, which one lawyer said was a \"sad day for the legal industry\".\n\nMarc Elias, a former Perkins Coie partner and a top lawyer for Democrats, assailed the agreement in a post on social media platform Bluesky.\n\n\"Paul Weiss, didn't just bend a knee, it set a new standard for shameful capitulation,\" he wrote. \"This is a stain on the firm, every one of its partners, and the entire legal profession.\"\n\nSoon after Trump made the announcement, Rachel Cohen, an associate at the Skadden Arps legal firm, resigned in a blistering company-wide email condemning the agreement.\n\n\"Please consider this email my two week notice, revocable if the firm comes up with a satisfactory response to the current moment,\" she wrote. Cohen had asked Skadden to sign onto a brief supporting another firm that has sued the Trump administration.\n\nShe had helped organise the open letter criticising the Trump administration for attempting to \"bully corporate law firms out of engaging in any representation that challenges the administration's aims\". More than 300 associates have signed the letter, using the name of their firm and class year, since it went live about a week ago, Politico reported.\n\nIn an internal email to its lawyers, Mr Karp defended the agreement, saying it was in line with the firm's principles, including a commitment to remaining politically independent, Reuters reported.\n\nThe firm brought in more than $2bn in annual revenues in 2023, and employed more than 1,000 attorneys, according to American Lawyer Magazine. Revoking its security clearance, which allows its lawyers to see some sensitive information, could have created hurdles to its work with its many corporate, security and Wall Street clients.\n\nIn the original executive order, Trump had accused the firm of playing \"an outsized role in undermining the judicial process and in the destruction of bedrock American principles\".\n\nIt had cited \"a Paul Weiss partner\" who had filed a pro bono lawsuit against the perpetrators of the 6 January 2021 riots at the Capitol. Trump has released all and pardoned many of those known as \"J6ers\".\n\nIt also took direct aim at Mark Pomerantz - a former partner who had worked with the Manhattan District Attorney on the case involving hush-money payments to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels. Trump was convicted by a jury last year of having committed a felony in the case.\n\nThe order had also alleged that the firm \"discriminates against its own employees on the basis of race and other categories prohibited by civil rights laws\".",

        "full_text": "George Foreman, heavyweight boxing icon and business entrepreneur, died on Friday night.\n\nHe was 76 years old.\n\nThe International Boxing Hall of Famer’s family announced the news on his Instagram page.\n\n“Our hearts are broken,” the caption read on the post. “With profound sorrow, we announce the passing of our beloved George Edward Foreman Sr. who peacefully departed on March 21, 2025 surrounded by loved ones. A devout preacher, a devoted husband, a loving father, and a proud grand and great grandfather, he lived a life marked by unwavering faith, humility, and purpose.”\n\nBorn in Marshall, Texas in 1949, Foreman, who admittedly was a bully in his youth, joined the Job Corps at 16 years old before turning to boxing at 17.\n\nHe made his first major stamp on the boxing world as a 19-year-old at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics when he won the heavyweight gold medal against Soviet fighter Jonas Čepulis.\n\nIn 2012, Foreman reminisced about the win and how “afraid” he was at the time of the fight after accumulating fewer than two dozen amateur fights before the Olympics.\n\n“When I look back at the fight, all I can remember was how afraid I was,” he told the BBC. “Chepulis was representing another ‘superpower’. I didn’t have the confidence that people thought I had.\n\n“I wanted to win gold but didn’t expect anything like that to happen in my life. But I was told to jab, jab, jab. With my jabs and other wild punches, there was no way to stop me. … The left jab was my number one punch — I still think it was the best punch in boxing.”\n\nOne year after his gold medal win, the fearsome and intimidating Foreman took up professional boxing, embarking on a legendary career that saw him accumulate a 76-5 record with 68 wins by knockout.\n\nIn 1973, he won his first of two heavyweight champions when he knocked out Joe Frazier — the heavyweight gold medalist in 1964 — during a bout in Jamaica.\n\nForeman lost the title one year later in the famous “Rumble in the Jungle” against Muhammad Ali in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo).\n\nIn 1977 after a defeat at the hands of Jimmy Young in a fight in Puerto Rico, Foreman suffered from exhaustion and heatstroke in what he called a near-death experience.\n\nHe stepped away from boxing for a decade and returned to Texas.\n\nHis life took a complete 180-degree turn as he became an ordained minister, and, in 1984, founded the George Foreman Youth and Community Center.\n\nForeman returned to the squared circle in 1987, and in 1994, found himself back on top in defeating Michael Moorer for his second heavyweight title at the age of 45 — two decades after losing his first to Ali.\n\n“Anything you desire, you can make happen,” Foreman said after that fight. “It’s like the song, ‘When you wish upon a star, your dreams come true.’ Well, look at me tonight.”\n\nIn 1997, he retired from boxing for good, having already reinvented himself as a gregarious pitchman endorsing various products, the most famous of which was the George Foreman Grill line, which earned him millions.\n\nForeman also made a number of television appearances in his life, including on a 1975 episode of “The Six Million Dollar Man” and, most recently, on “The Masked Singer” in 2022.\n\nHe had 12 children, and all five of his sons were named George.\n\n“I named all my sons George Edward Foreman so they would always have something in common. I say to them, ‘If one of us goes up, then we all go up together, and if one goes down, we all go down together,’ ” Foreman wrote on his website.\n\nWith his life spanning across sports and pop culture, stars from across the spectrum were saddened by the legend’s death.\n\n“Condolences to George Foreman’s family,” Mike Tyson wrote on X after the news of Foreman’s death broke. “His contribution to boxing and beyond will never be forgotten.”\n\n“Rest in peace, George Foreman. Your legacy lives on, champ,” NBA legend Scottie Pippen wrote.\n\n“Legendary boxing champion, life-changing preacher, husband, father, grand- and great-grandfather and the best friend you could have,” WBC President Mauricio Sulaiman wrote on his social media. “His memory is now eternal, may Big George rest in peace.”\n\n“Condolences to the family of George Foreman,” wrote actor William Shatner.\n\n“We are grateful for the outpouring of love and prayers, and kindly ask for privacy as we honor the extraordinary life of a man we were blessed to call our own,” Foreman’s family wrote in their statement.",

        "full_text": "George Foreman became the heavyweight champion of the world in his 20s, only to lose his belt to Muhammad Ali in perhaps the most memorable fight in boxing history.\n\nA full 20 years later in 1994, the 45-year-old Foreman became the oldest man to win the heavyweight championship, throwing one perfect combination to steal Michael Moorer’s title in an epic upset.\n\nFew fighters ever had more big moments than Big George Foreman — and even after he finally left the ring, he was only getting started.\n\nThe fearsome heavyweight, who lost the “Rumble in the Jungle” to Ali before his inspiring second act as a surprising champion and a successful businessman, died Friday night. Foreman was 76.\n\nForeman’s family announced his death on social media, not saying how or where he died.\n\n“A devout preacher, a devoted husband, a loving father and a proud grand- and great-grandfather, he lived a life marked by unwavering faith, humility and purpose,” his family wrote. “A humanitarian, an Olympian and two-time heavyweight champion of the world, he was deeply respected. A force for good, a man of discipline, conviction, and a protector of his legacy, fighting tirelessly to preserve his good name— for his family.”\n\nA native Texan, Foreman began his boxing career as an Olympic gold medalist who inspired fear and awe as he climbed to the peak of the heavyweight division by stopping Joe Frazier in 1973. His formidable aura evaporated only a year later when Ali pulled off one of the most audacious victories in boxing history in Zaire, baiting and taunting Foreman into losing his belt.\n\nForeman left the sport a few years later, but returned after a 10-year absence and a self-described religious awakening.\n\nThe middle-aged fighter then pulled off one of the most spectacular knockouts in boxing history, flooring Moorer — 19 years his junior — with a surgical right hand and claiming Moorer’s two heavyweight belts. Foreman’s 20 years is easily the longest gap between heavyweight title reigns.\n\n“His contribution to boxing and beyond will never be forgotten,” former heavyweight champion of the world, Mike Tyson, said on X, formerly Twitter, as he expressed his condolences.\n\nForeman’s transformation into an inspirational figure was complete, and he fought only four more times — finishing 76-5 with 68 knockouts — before moving onto his next career as a genial businessman, pitchman and occasional actor.\n\nOutside the ring, he was best known as the face of the George Foreman Grill, which launched in the same year as his victory over Moorer. The simple cooking machine sold more than 100 million units and made him much wealthier than his sport ever did.\n\n“George was a great friend to not only myself, but to my entire family,” Top Rank president Bob Arum said. “We’ve lost a family member and are absolutely devastated.”\n\nIn the first chapter of his boxing career, Foreman was nothing like the smiling grandfather who hawked his grills on television to great success.\n\nForeman dabbled in petty crime while growing up in Houston’s Fifth Ward, but changed his life through boxing. He made the U.S. Olympic team in 1968 and won gold in Mexico City as a teenager, stopping a 29-year-old opponent in a star-making performance.\n\nForeman rose to the pinnacle of the pro game over the next five years, but was also perceived as an aloof, unfriendly athlete, both through his demeanor and through the skewed racial lenses of the time.\n\nJim Lampley, the veteran boxing broadcaster who worked alongside Foreman for many years at HBO, told The Associated Press on Friday night that Foreman’s initial demeanor was an attempt by his camp to emulate Sonny Liston, the glowering heavyweight champ of the 1960s.\n\n“At some point somewhere along the way, he realized that wasn’t him,” Lampley said.\n\nForeman stopped Frazier in an upset in Jamaica in January 1973 to win the belt, with his knockout inspiring Howard Cosell’s iconic call: “Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!”\n\nForeman defended his belt against Ken Norton before accepting the fight with Ali in the now-immortal bout staged in Africa by promoter Don King. Ali put on a tactical masterclass against Foreman, showing off the “rope-a-dope” strategy that frustrated and infuriated the champion. Foreman was eventually knocked down for the first time in his career, and the fight was stopped in the eighth round.\n\nForeman told the BBC in 2014 that he took the fight almost out of charity to Ali, who he suspected to be broke.\n\n“I said I was going to go out there and kill him, and people said, ‘Please, don’t say you’re going to kill Muhammad,’” Foreman said. “So I said, ‘OK, I’ll just beat him down to the ground.’ That’s how easy I thought the fight would be.”\n\nExhausted and disillusioned, Foreman stopped fighting in 1977 and largely spent the next decade preaching and working with kids in Houston after his religious awakening. He returned to boxing in 1987 in his late 30s with a plan to defy time through frequent ring appearances, and he racked up a lengthy series of victories before losing to Evander Holyfield in a surprisingly competitive title fight in 1991.\n\nThree years later, Foreman got in the ring with Moorer in Las Vegas, more for his celebrity than for his perceived ability to beat Moorer. The champion appeared to win the first nine rounds rather comfortably, with Foreman unable to land his slower punches. But Foreman came alive in the 10th, hurting Moorer before slipping in the short right hand that sent Moorer to the canvas in earth-shaking fashion.\n\nLampley, who was calling the fight, named his upcoming autobiography — which includes a prologue about Foreman — after his famous call of that moment: “It Happened!”\n\nForeman quit the ring for good in 1997, although he occasionally discussed a comeback. He settled into a life as a boxing analyst for HBO and as a pitchman for the grills that grew his fame and fortune. Much of the world soon knew Foreman as both a lovable friend and a ferocious fighter.\n\n“He started performing as this pitchman, this product pitchman with the big, ever-present giant grin on his face,” Lampley recalled. “When I was working with him, people would say, ‘George is a big clown.’ And I would say, ‘Well, you can call him a clown, but he’s actually a genius. He may be the greatest genius I’ve ever met.’ And people would say, ‘Well, genius, what do you mean?’ I’d say, ‘Well, check the bank account. If that isn’t proof enough, I don’t know what is.’ So, he was a genius. He was a human genius.”\n\nForeman briefly starred in a sitcom called “George” in the 1990s, and he even appeared on the reality singing competition “The Masked Singer” in 2022. A biographical movie based on his life was released in 2023.\n\nForeman had 12 children, including five sons who are all famously named George Edward Foreman.\n\n“Legendary boxing champion, life-changing preacher, husband, father, grand- and great-grandfather and the best friend you could have,” WBC President Mauricio Sulaiman wrote on social media. “His memory is now eternal, may Big George rest in peace.”\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Brian Mahoney contributed to this report.\n\n___",

        "full_text": "It’s one of the most important debates taking place among Democrats after they lost the White House and the Senate last year. Their House majority was wiped away in the 2022 midterm elections. Democrats also suffered only their second national popular vote loss at the presidential level since 1988.\n\nTypically, the party out of power splits between forces that want to pivot back to the center, correcting mistakes that cost it the previous election, and those that think it is important to draw a stronger ideological contrast with their opponents.\n\nThe Democrats in 2025 are no different. Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) has made rhetorical overtures to Republicans and voted with them a handful of times. And Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) jeopardized his leadership position by defying the progressive base on a government shutdown. Both have faced backlash from those on the Left who want congressional Democrats to fight the GOP agenda at all costs.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris has been criticized for being too left-wing and cautious. Her past progressive positions, especially those taken in her failed 2020 presidential campaign, cost her votes in November. But she also soft-pedaled or reversed many of those stances, seeming like a flip-flopper and potentially depressing progressive enthusiasm for her candidacy.\n\nNewsom would surely like to be the Democratic standard-bearer in 2028. Since launching his podcast, he has interviewed MAGA figures such as Steve Bannon and Charlie Kirk. The California governor has also repudiated many progressive excesses, such as biological men competing as transgender women in female sports and the term “Latinx.”\n\nWalz might also be looking to strike out on his own after being Harris’s understudy in the 2024 campaign, especially if she doesn’t run again. The Minnesotan was sure to demonstrate he remained appropriately outraged by MAGA in all its forms.\n\nWhile Newsom said he wanted “to first understand what their motivations are” and figure “what they’re actually doing,” Walz had a simpler question for dealing with their shared political opponents: “How do we put some of those guys back under a rock?”\n\n“These are bad guys, though,” Walz said as Newsom explained why he had people such as Bannon and Kirk on his podcast. “These are bad guys.”\n\n“When you talk to a guy like Steve Bannon, he talks about working folks, and he talks about how we hollowed out the industrial core of this country,” Newsom said, later adding that what Bannon says “reminds me a lot of what Bernie Sanders was saying, reminds me a lot of what Democrats said 20, 30 years ago.”\n\n“But he denies the election!” Walz shot back, referring to 2020 instead of the more recent election he and other Democrats lost.\n\nNeither Newsom nor Walz is an ideal candidate for a Democratic rebranding. Both face major authenticity problems. Walz said of Trump supporters, “I do think I could kick most of their ass,” a characteristically awkward formulation. Newsom would have to explain constantly changing positions no less than Harris did and defend California’s dysfunction and liberalism.\n\nBut their conversation highlighted the Democrats’ choices in the next two elections. They can continue to run on democracy, Jan. 6, fighting Trump, and more or less reinforcing the progressive agenda. Or they can try to adjust, both in style and substance, so they are no longer on the wrong side of public opinion on as many matters.\n\nThe third option is to wait for Trump to self-destruct. It has happened before, and it is easy to see opportunities for it to happen again.\n\nSHINING ‘DAYLIGHT’ ON HOW DEMOCRATS BLEW THE 2024 ELECTION\n\nYet, after nearly a decade in national politics, Trump is still here. He is in the Oval Office while two leading lights of the Democratic Party are arguing about his aides on a podcast having failed to “kick most of their ass.”\n\nIt’s a conversation Democrats will be having a lot over the next couple of years.",

        "full_text": "The U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) reportedly issued a “threat advisory” on Thursday warning of “possible threats” from radical left-wing activists against the command’s Tesla owners.\n\nIn screenshots of the alert obtained by Federalist contributor and retired Army ranger John A. Lucas, the USASOC informed service members of increased “concerns” regarding recent attacks against individuals who own Teslas and dealerships that carry the vehicle.\n\nWithin the past few months, extreme left-wing anarchists have been waging a rhetorical and physical war against the electric car company to protest its founder Elon Musk’s role in identifying waste, fraud, and abuse throughout the federal government. These acts of left-wing “resistance” have ranged from harassing Tesla owners to outright vandalizing and destroying Tesla vehicles and dealerships.\n\nThe Trump Justice Department and FBI have pledged to crack down on what Attorney General Pam Bondi has referred to as incidents of “domestic terrorism.” Three individuals were indicted by the DOJ on Thursday for allegedly destroying Tesla properties.\n\nThe USASOC advisory noted that while there are currently “[n]o credible threats directed at USASOC personnel or assets … there is potential as this is an emerging threat.” The notice specifically highlighted a new website called “Dogequest,” which “has allegedly published personal details of Tesla owners across the United States, sparking concerns over privacy and security.”\n\n“Dogequest is an anonymous website that claims to ’empower creative expressions of protest’ by exposing Tesla owners’ personal data. According to 404 Media, the site includes a searchable database of Tesla drivers along with the locations of Tesla dealerships and charging stations,” the USASOC notice reads. “The site, which appears in the wake of anti-Elon Musk protests across the country, displays names, addresses, and phone numbers of Tesla owners on an interactive map and uses an image of a Molotov cocktail as its cursor.”\n\nEqually notable, however, is the USASOC alert about an allegedly upcoming “Tesla Takedown” day of action.\n\nThe warning noted that “[p]rotesters worldwide are preparing for their largest demonstration yet, 500 coordinated actions at Tesla showrooms on March 29 aimed at CEO Elon Musk’s controversial policies.” The notice cited remarks from Alice Hu, named as executive director of the left-wing Planet Over Profit, who purportedly disclosed that such demonstrations will take place at the more than 275 Tesla showrooms across America and “hundreds more abroad.”\n\nThe threat advisory concluded by encouraging USASOC members to “remain on high alert while in public areas, especially in presence of Tesla branded items” and “[c]ontact the proper authorities for threat-related events once you are in a safe location.” It also advised “Tesla branded items owners [to] properly secure their property to prevent unwanted damage to their property” and all personnel to remain in a “safe location” on March 29.\n\nShawn Fleetwood is a staff writer for The Federalist and a graduate of the University of Mary Washington.

        "full_text": "USDA did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThe collective cuts are expected to make it more difficult for food banks to meet families’ needs, with food prices now 20 percent higher than they were in 2020, food bank leaders say.\n\n“I certainly look at our lines and look at our shelves and say we need some relief,” said Joree Novotny, executive director of the Ohio Association of Foodbanks, which also reported canceled deliveries with no indication they would resume.\n\nFor the Central California Food Bank, that means a loss of 500,000 pounds of expected food deliveries worth $850,000 just for April through July, according to co-CEO Natalie Caples. Cathy Kanefsky, president of the Food Bank of Delaware, said between 20 to 24 full truckloads of food were canceled for the next four months.\n\nThe money that was clawed back across the three programs came from the Commodity Credit Corporation, a New Deal-era fund that gives USDA flexibility to prop up farmers facing natural disasters or adverse market conditions.\n\nIt’s not clear how much of the $500 million for the emergency assistance program has been cut, but one USDA employee, granted anonymity to discuss private conversations, said the Trump administration has been trying to claw back CCC money the Biden administration previously allocated in order to devote funds to other priorities.\n\nUSDA was supposed to spend $148 million of the $500 million early this year to buy dairy products, eggs, blueberries and more. But last month, the department notified state agencies that it was canceling solicitations from suppliers, according to a Feb. 20 email that Feeding America sent to its network of food banks and was viewed by POLITICO.\n\n“USDA has not yet announced plans to move forward with the canceled food orders,” the email states. “We believe the best approach is for network members to work through state agencies to obtain clarification from USDA.”\n\nFeeding America did not respond to a request for comment. Caples, the California food bank leader, said that she has not received any assurances from USDA on whether the delivery cancellations are temporary.\n\nChad Morrison, president of West Virginia’s Mountaineer Food Bank, said it is “really challenging” to meet the need in this state.\n\n“We can try to figure out how to make up the gaps, which is a hard lift, or ultimately there’s less food on the table,” Morrison said.\n\nThe emergency food assistance network gets its funding from a mix of money from the farm bill and through commodities USDA purchases. But the patchwork funding system has left the program unable to meet increasing hunger needs, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent years of food inflation, anti-hunger advocates say.\n\nThe Biden administration responded to the demand on food banks by supplementing the emergency assistance funding with roughly $2 billion from the CCC fund in 2022 and 2023, then the additional $500 million in 2024. But Republicans have argued that President Joe Biden used the CCC money for climate and nutrition initiatives that are outside the congressional mandate of the fund.\n\nMany of the organizations that rely on funding from the emergency assistance program were also receiving funding from the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement, one of the other food programs USDA axed recently.\n\nThe clawbacks come as Congress is weighing shrinking the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which helps 40 million low-income Americans afford food. That could further exacerbate the pressure on food banks, which provide just one meal for every nine that SNAP supplies.\n\n“We’re not intended to be a frontline grocery store and unfortunately we are that for more people than ever before,” said Novotny.",

        "full_text": "(Story has been updated to add more information.)\n\nThursday marked two months since President Donald Trump was sworn into office for his second term.\n\nWhile Trump's net approval ratings came out of the gates higher than in 2017, though still lower than those of any other president in modern history, recent polls show public sentiment more split, or in some cases more negative.\n\nBy late February, just one month into his term, his net approval rating − which is calculated as the difference between a president's approval and disapproval polling averages − had shrunk to nearly even.\n\nSince then, Trump has marched on with federal agency cuts and has continued to feature Elon Musk in a central role in his administration, both of which are controversial with voters, multiple polls have shown.\n\nMany modern presidents have seen their approval ratings gradually dip throughout their first year in office as they exit the so-called \"honeymoon period.\"\n\nHere is what polls tell us about how Americans approve of Trump's second presidency so far.\n\nHow Republicans' united front, Democrats' division play into Trump's approval ratings\n\nTwo months later, Trump's approval ratings did not show a major shift from the beginning of his term or compared with his first term, according to Costas Panagopoulos, head of political science at Northeastern University.\n\nBut he also said voters may continue to have reservations about the administration's priorities as the early policies unfold, especially as inflation continues and the stock market tries to recover from a tumble that started in February.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who dismissed other claims and comments that he made during the campaign because they expected that his priorities would be in line with things that they wanted,\" he told USA TODAY in an interview Thursday, mentioning the economy and inflation as examples. \"Now they're seeing well that might not be the case.\"\n\nBut crucial to understanding Trump's approval ratings, Panagopoulos says, is the Republican and Democratic parties, because Trump's approval ratings come from an already polarized electorate.\n\nWhile Democrats are fragmented, Republicans are putting forward a \"united front\" in supporting Trump, according to Panagopoulos.\n\n\"At least for now, that might be artificially inflating Trump's approval numbers overall, but specifically among Republicans,\" he said. \"People are not going to move away from Trump until they have an alternative they can move towards.\"\n\nWhat the Trump administration means for you: Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter.\n\nWhat presidential approval polls are saying\n\nNBC News:\n\nMore respondents disapprove of Trump's job than approve by a margin of 4 percentage points (poll conducted March 7-11; 1,000 registered voters; margin of error ±3.1 percentage points).\n\nThe poll found that more respondents today believe the executive and judicial branches have too much power than when asked about the same thing in 2019, according to NBC News.\n\nEconomist/YouGov:\n\nMore respondents have an unfavorable view of Trump than a favorable view, by a margin of 51% to 46% (poll conducted March 16-18; 1,618 U.S. adults; ±3.4 percentage points).\n\nDemocrats in Congress have become \"much less popular in the past few months,\" while Republicans in Congress have become more popular, according to YouGov.\n\nFifty percent of respondents to the poll somewhat or strongly oppose the recent layoffs of federal workers by the Department of Government Efficiency, compared to 38% who support the layoffs.\n\nMorning Consult:\n\nMorning Consult's measure of Trump's approval ratings has flipped net negative for the first time since he took office, with more respondents disapproving of his job performance (50%) than those who approve (48%). (Poll conducted March 14-16; 2,210 registered voters; margin of error ±2 percentage points.)\n\nTrump's approval rating with Morning Consult turned net negative a week later during Trump's first presidency.\n\n\"More voters than not still approve of Trump’s handling of most issues, with the president receiving his best marks on immigration (55% approval) and national security (52% approve),\" Morning Consult states.\n\nRMG Research/Napolitan News Service:\n\n54% of respondents either strongly approve or somewhat approve of Trump's job, compared with 44% who disapprove, strongly or somewhat (poll taken March 6-13; 3,000 registered voters; margin of error ±1.8 percentage points).\n\nKinsey Crowley is a trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

        "full_text": "Fulfillment of these lofty ambitions obliged America to support democracies and oppose dictatorships. As a global superpower with responsibilities no other nation was either able — or willing — to undertake, it could not afford to have the impeccably moral foreign policy of Sweden. Idealism inevitably clashed with realism, with the latter often triumphing over the former. This was especially true during the Cold War, when Washington helped engineer the overthrow of democratically elected leaders and supported authoritarian regimes. And it continues today with American backing of repressive governments in the Middle East. But even while employing immoral means, American leaders did so in the pursuit of what they considered moral ends, whether fighting communism, halting the spread of weapons of mass destruction, or resisting radical Islam.\n\nOpponents of the American-led liberal international order harp endlessly upon its faults while taking its virtues — free and open sea lanes, the spread of liberal democracy, values-based alliances, the protection of human rights — for granted. Eager to lambaste the order for its many faults, they prefer not to grapple with the international system rapidly taking its place, a dog-eats-dog world where America has abdicated its role as global policeman and authoritarian states gain spheres of influence in which less powerful countries must bend to their will. Even the most vociferous critics of American global power may come to miss it once Russia, China and Iran gain dominance over Europe, Asia and the Middle East.\n\nThe centurieslong record of at least rhetorical support for right over wrong is what made last month’s Oval Office meeting so unsettling. In a display that ought to shame every American, the country’s top two constitutional officers acted like a king and his regent, demanding obeisance from a feudal supplicant. Within days, Trump suspended military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, and while both were later restored, the message he sent was unmistakable: Not even an ally under military attack can depend upon Washington for support. Having abandoned Ukraine out of personal pique, Trump then returned to taking on the world’s other villains: Canada, Denmark and Panama.\n\nIn addition to abandoning our democratic allies abroad, Trump is gutting America’s democracy-promotion apparatus at home. During the Cold War, Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (the latter my former employer) broadcasted news and information beyond the Iron Curtain and continue this mission in regions of the world that remain unfree. (Many nations once subject to Soviet domination — including Poland, Czechia and the Baltic states — can credit VOA and RFE/RL, at least in part, for their freedom). The United States Agency for International Development was founded during the administration of Kennedy to alleviate the social and economic conditions in which authoritarianism and terrorism thrive. And the National Endowment for Democracy, created under Reagan, provides grants to democratic activists around the globe. Trump has halted funding for all of these organizations, which represent the best of American values, to cheers from Moscow, Beijing and Tehran.\n\nIn place of the idealism that animated American leadership of the Free World, Trump has unleashed the atavistic cynicism of the Old World. In this new dispensation where might makes right, any appeal to moral considerations in the practice of American foreign policy is ridiculed as a deficiency of the weak while the amoral exercise of power is venerated as a virtue of the strong. Instinctive American sympathy for the underdog is supplanted by admiration for the strongman. An embattled democracy is accused of provoking the invasion of its own territory — the geopolitical equivalent of blaming a rape victim for her own assault — and for the first time in history America votes with the world’s rogues against its traditional democratic allies at the United Nations. The occupant of the office once synonymous with “leader of the Free World” slanders the president of a country fighting for its very existence as a “dictator” while lauding a despotic war criminal as “a great guy” and a “terrific person.” At least when Franklin Roosevelt (allegedly) said that Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza “may be a son of a bitch, but he’s our son of a bitch,” he had the moral clarity to identify the caudillo for what he was, and the tact to do so behind closed doors.\n\nWhile Trump borrows from the Andrew Jackson school of American foreign policy, notable for its strident nationalism and distrust of international institutions, the historical figure whose ideas (and slogans) he leans most heavily on is Pat Buchanan. Once a marginal figure on the American right, the former Nixon speechwriter and Republican presidential candidate stood for the same “America First” trifecta — anti-immigration, anti-intervention and protectionism — as Trump does today. In the brave new world of America First, no longer does America stand for the belief that democracies make better allies than dictatorships, that territorial aggression should be punished rather than rewarded, and that alliances are an asset, not a burden. In his Munich speech, Vance endorsed the inclusion of far-right parties in European governments, which he accused of posing a greater threat to their own people than either Russia or China. All of this is the result of a foreign policy utterly lacking in moral scruples.\n\nThe abandonment of morality as a factor in foreign affairs also marks a turning point for the Republican Party. Next month marks the 50th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War. American conservatives once pointed to that event — the chaotic scenes of desperate Vietnamese fleeing the approaching communist onslaught, the 2 million boat people who managed to escape, the horrific repression that followed for those who did not — as a shameful example of what happens when the U.S. abandons an ally. Whatever the merits of American involvement in that conflict, the dire consequences of the American withdrawal reverberated across the region. Within months, Laos and Cambodia fell to communist insurgencies, vindicating the much derided “domino theory.”\n\nTrump’s abandonment of Ukraine has the potential to dwarf these events in geopolitical magnitude and human suffering. If Ukraine is made to sign a peace deal that doesn’t provide clear-cut security guarantees it will only be a matter of time before Russian President Vladimir Putin attempts another Anschluss. Absent American leadership of the Free World, such an incursion could succeed in toppling the Kyiv government, leading to tens of millions of refugees and a massive Russian military presence on the border of several NATO member states. With the alliance’s guarantee of collective security in tatters thanks to Trump’s extortionist threats not to uphold it, NATO — the most successful military alliance in history — will for all intents and purposes be dead, opening the door for further Russian predation in Europe and elsewhere.\n\nLooking for silver linings, some nostalgic for the recently departed era of American global leadership cling to the hope that everything will return to normal once a Democrat or traditional Republican moves into the Oval Office. While the fight over the future of conservative foreign policy is ongoing, there is no turning back. No longer confident of their place under the American security umbrella, alarmed allies like Poland and South Korea are exploring the possibility of acquiring nuclear weapons. The once-ridiculed French idea of “strategic autonomy” — a pole of European military power independent of the United States — is now the top agenda item across the continent. The “Five Eyes” intelligence-sharing alliance composed of the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand may shrink to “Four Eyes” due to the unreliability of its most powerful member.\n\nWhat transpired during the last two weeks of February cannot be undone in the minds of America’s allies or its adversaries. And in a world where every man is for himself, what’s the difference between the two?",

        "full_text": "Greenpeace backed radical protesters who tried to block a North Dakota pipeline. Now the pipeline company has won huge damages in a lawsuit against the iconic NGO. Other nonprofits should take notice.\n\nOn Wednesday, a jury in Mandan, North Dakota returned a stunning verdict against Greenpeace for its role in the violent protests and misleading PR campaign that disrupted construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline in 2016. The jury hearing the civil lawsuit found Greenpeace USA and two other Greenpeace entities liable for civil conspiracy, defamation, trespass, and other misdeeds. If the verdict stands, the storied environmental nonprofit will have to pay $667 million in damages to plaintiff Energy Transfer, the pipeline company that built and owns the DAPL.\n\nThe decision wasn’t entirely unexpected. In fact, Greenpeace had tried (and failed) to get the trial location changed, asserting that a jury in that oil-producing region would be biased in favor of the plaintiff. Nonetheless, the sheer size of the damages awarded will send shock waves through the loose networks of nonprofit groups that support disruptive protests around the nation.\n\nIn a City Journal article about the case, I noted similarities between the anti-pipeline protests near North Dakota’s Standing Rock Indian Reservation and other mass actions, including Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 and the anti-Israel demonstrations that erupted around the United States after the October 7 attacks. Making an analogy to hybrid warfare, I described these as “hybrid protests,” in which masses of peaceful demonstrators are joined by smaller groups of trained agitators who tip the events toward violence. As Park MacDougald has reported, these loose networks of troublemakers are often financially supported “by a vast web of progressive nonprofits, NGOs, foundations, and dark-money groups.”\n\nEnergy Transfer’s suit against Greenpeace represents the first major success in exposing and penalizing the putatively legitimate nonprofits that funnel money and material support to the lawbreakers embedding themselves in these hybrid protests. If the enormous verdict survives the inevitable appeals, it will be a major shot across the bows of progressive organizations that quietly foment political mayhem while maintaining plausible deniability.\n\nMany hybrid protests begin spontaneously as local people gather to demonstrate against a perceived injustice. But soon, outside activists—including trained Antifa-style agitators—begin flooding in. When police made arrests at various pro-Hamas campus uprisings, for example, they found that roughly half the arrestees had no connection to the schools they were occupying. These activists have the funds to travel long distances for extended periods and often arrive with specialized equipment for blocking roads, occupying structures, or fighting police. Some, like the lifelong activist Lisa Fithian, whom the New York Times observed leading the takeover of Columbia University’s Hamilton Hall, describe themselves as “trainers” teaching supposedly nonviolent tactics to neophyte protesters.\n\nEnergy Transfer’s civil lawsuit alleged that something similar took place at Standing Rock. Greenpeace maintains that the protest was led by local Native American activists and that the environmental group merely offered incidental support. The group is correct that the conflict began when the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe began protesting the pipeline being built close to its reservation. But, as a firsthand report in Outside detailed, before long outsiders—most of them white—began dominating the gathering. While local Sioux leaders struggled to keep the protests peaceful, many of the newcomers began blockading roads, torching heavy equipment, and battling with police.\n\nDuring the trial, Energy Transfer’s lawyers presented evidence that Greenpeace played a significant role in supporting the activists pushing for “direct action” against the pipeline. Greenpeace USA paid roughly $20,000 to send protest trainers—including a Greenpeace employee—to Standing Rock, court documents showed, while the group’s executive director personally raised another $90,000 for the effort. One internal Greenpeace email estimated the funding “has the potential to provide skills training to 3,000 activists.” Another Greenpeace employee bragged in an email about doing “some awesome spy shit” while scouting for potential blockade locations near the construction site.\n\nGreenpeace also supplied power tools, propane, tents, cold-weather gear, and a van equipped with solar panels. Energy Transfer’s lawyers particularly focused on the 20 to 30 “lockboxes” Greenpeace delivered to the Standing Rock occupation. A lockbox—sometimes known as a “sleeping dragon”—is a sophisticated device that allows activists to chain themselves to heavy equipment or to each other while forming human blockades. They consist of heavy PVC or concrete tubes into which activists can lock their arms, making it impossible for police to separate or move them without special equipment. The lockboxes proved a major headache for law enforcement officers trying to remove protesters from highways and construction sites. One photo displayed at the trial showed a Greenpeace-paid trainer using a lockbox. When then-Greenpeace executive director Annie Leonard received a text showing another demonstrator employing the device, she responded approvingly that the action “ups the ante.” Asked to explain that phrase in court, Leonard compared the protester with anti-segregation activist Rosa Parks.\n\nThe North Dakota jury also supported Energy Transfer’s claims that Greenpeace defamed the company in its public statements about the project and illegally interfered with the company’s relationship with financial institutions. Greenpeace maintains that its actions supporting protesters and its claims regarding Energy Transfer all fall under the First Amendment. “We should all be concerned about the future of the First Amendment, and lawsuits like this aimed at destroying our rights to peaceful protest and free speech,” Deepa Padmanabha, senior legal counsel for Greenpeace USA, told the Washington Post. The jury concluded, however, that trespassing and vandalism don’t constitute peaceful protest, and defamation is not free speech.\n\nAsked for comment on the verdict, a spokesperson sent me this statement from Greenpeace USA executive director Sushma Raman: “This is the end of a chapter, but not the end of our fight. Energy Transfer knows we don’t have $660 million. They want our silence, not our money.”\n\nEnergy Transfer no doubt faces a long road before it can collect any money from Greenpeace. The NGO has already announced that it will appeal the verdict, and one of the group’s international affiliates has filed suit against the pipeline company in the Netherlands under an EU free-speech law. But Energy Transfer’s stunning court victory will have an impact that far outweighs any financial gains.\n\nOver the decades, progressive NGOs have grown increasingly bold about funding radical organizations that support violent actions. Many of these seemingly mainstream groups rely on liberal donors who are unaware of just where their money is going. They rely on a veneer of respectability—and opaque funding channels—to shield them from lawsuits or prosecution. But for nonprofits that conduct or fund genuinely illegal behavior, the era of the untouchable NGO may be coming to an end.",

The records show that GEC extensively communicated with an assortment of USAID branches, including \"TF 2020-COVID 19,\" \"Digital Development,\" Asia Bureau ES Taskers,\" \"Asia Outreach,\" \"Conflict Prevention and Stabilization (CPS) Policy,\" and \"CPS Africa.\"\n\nAccording to America First Legal's findings, the GEC also collaborated with private-sector internet censors, such as Poynter and NewsGuard, to use AI censorship tools for monitoring \"misinformation.\"\n\nTwo days after the 2020 presidential election, Matt Skibinski, general manager of NewsGuard Technologies, started an email chain pitching NewsGuard's services. Included in this email chain were government employees with the U.S. State Department, the National Security Agency (NSA), and U.S. Defense Department components, including the National Security Innovation Network (NSIN), U.S. Cyber Command, and the U.S. Army European Command.\n\nThe principal email recipient was ex-Obama State Department official Christina Nemr, the director of Park Advisors at the time. Park Advisors, according to Nemr's LinkedIn page, \"Designed and led multi-million public-private initiatives addressing security threats in the information environment, bridging gaps between emerging technologies and real-world operational needs.\" In this role, Nemr said she also \"support[ed] government adoption.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year, the U.S. House Small Business Committee found that Park Advisors received a GEC cooperative agreement award of more than $6 million. Park Advisors then distributed subawards to several companies, including NewsGuard, the Atlantic Council, and the Global Disinformation Index, a Soros-funded project that reportedly generated a blacklist of conservative websites that advertising companies should boycott.\n\nTogether, these groups, which are not subject to the same international restrictions that GEC was, tested disinformation products, leading to the creation of the \"Disinfo Cloud,\" an unclassified platform used by the U.S. government and other world powers \"to counter adversarial propaganda and disinformation.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSkibinski provided samples of the new GEC/U.S Cybercommand Testbed Pilot (a.k.a. \"Misinformation Fingerprints\"), a program utilizing artificial intelligence and machine learning to monitor \"misinformation,\" flag examples, and rank sites accordingly.\n\nResearch from the Foundation For Freedom Online revealed how NewsGuard operates the enforcement arm of the censorship industry and rates websites based on how much perceived \"misinformation\" each page publishes.\n\nFurthermore, on February 4, 2021, Vonda Wolcott, senior program manager at the Institute for War and Peace Reporting, connected GEC's Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) \"expert\" with Baybars Orsek from Poynter, which, according to America First Legal, funds a global false-flag operation of international \"fact-checkers.\" Though they claim to be independent, this army of content moderators pledge fealty to a tightly woven network bankrolled by Poynter and the GEC.\n\nOne of the released emails illustrates how closely GEC and Poynter worked in tandem, with GEC's \"expert\" offering to \"walk [Poynter] through GEC's new M&E workbook.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the investigative work of America First Legal, the GEC also collaborated with foreign officials in the British Foreign, Commonwealth, & Development Office on \"disinformation\" efforts.\n\nThe now-defunct GEC, which was established by then-President Barack Obama via executive order, \"counter[ed] foreign disinformation\" before it was forced to shut down in December 2024 following a number of First Amendment lawsuits. Through several Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, America First Legal previously uncovered that the GEC engaged in state-sponsored propaganda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The partnership between USAID and the Global Engagement Center is bad news for the American people. Add in the fact that they were coordinating with internet censorship enforcers at NewsGuard and Poynter, and you can start to see just how dangerous this unholy alliance is for free speech and free expression,\" America First Legal senior counsel Andrew Block said in a statement. \"Thankfully, the GEC is shuttered and USAID is being exposed — but lawmakers should take note of this example as they consider legislation to ensure the federal government actually serves American principles and interests.\"\n\nTownhall knows all too well what it’s like to be the target of internet censors like NewsGuard. They’ve tried to silence us, to bully us into only covering the “approved narrative.” But thanks to the support of our VIP members, we get to keep sharing the facts and stories that matter most to our you.",

        "full_text": "President Trump continued his push to unwind the U.S. Department of Education on Friday, announcing that the management of the entire federal student loan portfolio and of the department's \"special needs\" programs would be moved to other federal agencies immediately.\n\nAppearing in the Oval Office with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Trump said, \"I've decided that the SBA, the Small Business Administration, headed by Kelly Loeffler, a terrific person, will handle all of the student loan portfolio. We have a portfolio that's very large,\" Trump said.\n\nThe federal student loan portfolio — which includes about $1.6 trillion in loans for roughly 43 million borrowers — is currently overseen by the Education Department's office of Federal Student Aid (FSA). That office has been gutted by the recent raft of buyouts, early retirements and last week's broad reduction-in-force.\n\nIt was not clear, based on Trump's announcement, how or if the remaining employees and expertise at FSA would be transferred to the Small Business Administration.\n\nTrump said he would move student loans \"out of the Department of Education immediately\" and that Loeffler and her staff are \"all set for it. They're waiting for it. It'll be serviced much better than it has in the past. It's been a mess.\"\n\nSome 8 million federal student loan borrowers are currently in legal limbo, not making loan payments, because their Biden-era repayment plan was frozen by a judge for being potentially illegal. Borrowers also can't currently enroll in any of the federal government's income-driven repayment plans, though that is expected to change soon.\n\nIn a statement, Loeffler said, \"As the government's largest guarantor of business loans, the SBA stands ready to deploy its resources and expertise on behalf of America's taxpayers and students.\"\n\nBut those resources are about to take a big hit as well, as the SBA also announced on Friday that it plans to cut its workforce by more than 40%.\n\nMultiple sources at FSA who could not speak publicly for fear of retribution said they were blindsided by the news.\n\nLogistical challenges aside, the role of the office of Federal Student Aid as the administrator of the student loan portfolio is protected by law. It's not clear how these responsibilities could be legally moved without a vote of Congress.\n\nIn a statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt acknowledged, \"The President has always said Congress has a role to play in this effort, and we expect them to help the President deliver.\"\n\nAs recently as Thursday, Leavitt had assured reporters that, \"when it comes to student loans and Pell Grants, those will still be run out of the Department of Education.\"\n\nChanges to oversight of 'special needs' remain unclear\n\nAfter announcing these potential changes to the federal student loan portfolio, Trump then said, \"Bobby Kennedy, the Health and Human Services [secretary], will be handling special needs,\" referring to cabinet member Robert F. Kennedy.\n\nThis appears to be a reference to the federal law known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which the Education Department administers. The law guarantees students with disabilities the right to a free, appropriate education and, in 2024, sent roughly $15 billion to schools to help pay for special education services. The law also makes clear that it is the secretary of education's responsibility to administer these funds.\n\nIn a post on Bluesky, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., called the potential changes \"a clear violation of education & appropriations law.\"\n\nThe Education Department has a dedicated Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, and, as with the federal student loan portfolio, it's unclear how these collective responsibilities on behalf of children with disabilities could be moved legally without a vote of Congress.\n\nIn a post on X, Health and Human Services Secretary Kennedy said his agency \"is fully prepared to take on the responsibility of supporting individuals with special needs.\"\n\nNot everyone was convinced.\n\n\"This is not a minor bureaucratic reorganization — it is a fundamental redefinition of how our country treats children with disabilities,\" said Keri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union, which represents more than 1,800 parent organizations across the country.",

President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin talked Tuesday on the phone for a few hours, and Zelensky and Trump talked Wednesday.\n\nSince the president’s return to office in January, the Trump administration has set out on a mission to end the Russia-Ukraine war, which passed its three-year mark last month.\n\n“We have never been closer to peace with these two parties,” Bruce said.",

        "full_text": "WASHINGTON — Trump adviser Elon Musk visited the Pentagon on Friday for a briefing that President Donald Trump insists was focused on the tech mogul's Department of Government Efficiency efforts, disputing a New York Times report that the meeting would include a discussion of plans for any potential war with China.\n\n\"He's there for DOGE, not there for China, and if you ever mentioned China, I think he'd walk out of the room,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office later in the morning when asked about Musk's meeting.\n\nThe Times was first to report Musk's Pentagon briefing. Citing two U.S. officials, the news outlet also reported that the meeting would focus on what the military might do if any war were to break out with China. Trump and his defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, repeatedly denied the report.\n\n“We welcomed him today to the Pentagon to talk about DOGE, to talk about efficiencies, to talk about innovations,\" Hegseth told reporters at the Oval Office after he and Trump had announced the production of a next-generation fighter jet. \"It was a great, informal conversation. The rest of that reporting was fake. There was no war plans, there was no Chinese war plans. There was no secret plans.\"\n\nHegseth, who had met with Musk in the morning at the Pentagon, did not say whether the discussion completely excluded talk about China more generally.\n\nMusk arrived at the Pentagon at a little before 9 a.m. ET and his visit lasted a little over an hour. When asked afterward how the meeting went, he told reporters as he was walking with Hegseth, “It’s always a great meeting.”\n\n“I’ve been here before, you know,\" Musk added as the two men joined in a laugh.\n\nThree defense officials had confirmed to NBC News earlier Friday that Musk had been scheduled to have a briefing at the Pentagon, and one of the topics would be China. But the officials could not confirm that the meeting would focus specifically on plans for any potential war, known as the operational plan, or O plan. Two of the officials also said the briefing would be unclassified.\n\nThe decision to brief Musk on military plans for China would mark a notable evolution of his involvement in the Trump administration and, potentially, his access to U.S. secrets. Musk, whom the president has charged with overseeing a government cost-cutting initiative known as the Department of Government Efficiency, could also have conflicts of interest, as Musk’s own products and businesses are used by the federal government, including Starlink and SpaceX, which contracts with the Defense Department.\n\nMusk also has deep financial interests in China — his electric vehicle maker Tesla has two facilities in Shanghai, and China is the company's second-largest market.\n\nLate Thursday night, Trump denied the Times' article, saying in a post to his Truth Social platform that the news outlet had reported \"incorrectly, that Elon Musk is going to the Pentagon tomorrow to be briefed on any potential 'war with China.' How ridiculous? China will not even be mentioned or discussed. How disgraceful it is that the discredited media can make up such lies. Anyway, the story is completely untrue!!!”\n\nAsked for comment about Musk's visit to the Pentagon, the White House referred to the president's Truth Social post.\n\nHegseth also denied the Times report, saying in a post on X \"this is NOT a meeting about 'top secret China war plans.' It's an informal meeting about innovation, efficiencies & smarter production.”\n\nPentagon spokesman Sean Parnell called the Times’ reporting “100% Fake News” in a post on X. “Just brazenly & maliciously wrong. Elon Musk is a patriot. We are proud to have him at the Pentagon.”\n\nAsked Friday in the Oval Office why he wouldn't want to show potential plans for a war with China to Musk, Trump said, \"I don’t want to show that to anybody, but certainly you wouldn’t show it to a businessman who is helping us so much. He’s a great patriot,\" referring to Musk's spearheading of the administration's efforts to slash the size of government.\n\n\"He’s finding tremendous waste, fraud and abuse,\" Trump said. \"But I certainly wouldn’t want, you know Elon has businesses in China, and he would be susceptible, perhaps, to that, but it was such a fake story.”",

She did not provide further details.\n\nIt was unclear when or how the scientist might have worked at or interacted with the laboratory at Los Alamos, N.M.\n\nLos Alamos National Laboratory is best known as a place that was crucial to the development of the atomic bomb.\n\nToday, it is a top research facility for the National Nuclear Security Administration, but it also conducts scientific work on other topics. Jennifer Talhelm, a spokesperson for the laboratory, said it was “working with federal officials to understand more about the incident” involving the scientist.\n\nThe scientist was working for France’s publicly funded National Center for Scientific Research. Representatives for the center said that he did not wish to speak to the media, but they did not immediately respond to the Department of Homeland Security’s allegations against him.\n\nNeither did the office of Mr. Baptiste, who used to lead the French National Center for Space Studies before he became minister in 2024.\n\nBut on Friday, Mr. Baptiste repeated his claim that the scientist had been targeted because of private discussions and opinions about the Trump administration’s policies.\n\nHe told Sud Radio in an interview that he had not spoken with the scientist directly but that his ministry was in touch with him.\n\n“Each country is free to regulate their borders,” Mr. Baptiste acknowledged. But he said the scientist’s case was “extraordinarily atypical” and a “subject of concern.”\n\nThat concern was shared by the French Academy of Sciences, which said in a statement on Thursday that the scientist’s deportation “seriously undermines the fundamental freedoms of the academic world: freedom of thought, expression and travel.”\n\nZolan Kanno-Youngs contributed reporting from Washington, D.C., and Ségolène Le Stradic from Paris.",

        "full_text": "The head of the federal task force to combat antisemitism dismissed “rumors” Thursday that Columbia University was nearing a deal to restore $400 million in federal funds frozen by the Trump administration, arguing that the Ivy League school was “not even close” to meeting President Trump’s demands.\n\n“There was a rumor out there that there was a settlement approaching to restore Columbia’s $400 billion that we froze. Let me be very clear to your listeners and to the nation and to the Jewish American community. That’s not true,” task force chief Leo Terrell told John Catsimatidis and Rita Cosby during an appearance on “Cats & Cosby.”\n\nLocal outlet WABC-TV and the Wall Street Journal have both reported that Columbia University was nearing a deal to meet nine preconditions set forth by the Trump administration that would allow it to consider restoring funding amounting to roughly 8% of the institution’s US-taxpayer funding.\n\nThe administration demands for “formal negotiations” regarding the elite school’s “continued financial relationship with the United States government” to move forward include the school punishing those responsible for the violent takeover of Hamilton Hall in April 2024, moving the disciplinary process to the office of the president, implementing an on-campus mask ban, formalizing an antisemitism definition and placing the school’s Middle East, South Asian and African Studies departments under “academic receivership” for at least five years, which would give someone outside of the departments the power to make decisions for the faculty.\n\n“President Trump and [Attorney General] Pam Bondi have made it a commitment that this task force – we’re going to eradicate antisemitism at all of these schools, and I will submit to you, Rita, that’s not happening at this point at Columbia University,” Terrell said.\n\n“I will tell you right now that Columbia has not, in my opinion, and the opinion of the Department of Justice, has not cleaned up their act regarding anti-Semitism,” he added. “I’m also telling you that there is no agreement – they’re not even close, not even close to having those funds unfrozen.”\n\n“Jewish American students don’t feel comfortable going to that school,” Terrell said of Columbia.\n\nColumbia University faced a Thursday deadline to agree to the preconditions, but the Trump administration has extended the deadline until the end of Friday, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe university declined to comment on Terrell’s remarks or the status of negotiations.\n\nThe antisemitism task force head further revealed that he will soon be going on a tour of 10 universities to warn them “If you want federal funding, if you want to make sure that you are going to avoid lawsuits under Title VI, Title VII, if you want to make sure your tax status is correct, you have to allow Jewish American students to go to school without being harassed or tormented.”\n\n“Not one of those universities on my list has met that standard,” Terrell said.",

        "full_text": "​Patrick Healy, the deputy Opinion editor, hosted an online conversation with four Times Opinion columnists about the Trump administration’s popularity among Republicans and why so many in the party believe the country is heading in the right direction.\n\nPatrick Healy: David, Bret, David, Ross: Donald Trump is the only president in our lifetimes who’s had a net-negative job approval rating in his first 100 days in office. Trump also has the largest gap in approval ratings in 80 years — 90 percent of Republicans like his performance, while only 4 percent of Democrats do. Those Trump supporters are really on board with him; more registered voters think America is on the right track than at any point since 2004, according to a new NBC News poll. To be clear, a majority still say America’s on the wrong track, and Trump’s polling on the economy is sagging. But I want to dig into why more voters feel better about America’s direction now than compared with under Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Trump 1.0.\n\nAnd I wanted to do so through the eyes of my more conservative colleagues. The four of you span the ideological spectrum on the right, and you’ve all written extensively about Trump. Why do so many Republicans like the direction Trump is taking the country in? Is it about his style, or his policies, or the mind-set and mood of the G.O.P., or something else?\n\nDavid Brooks: I’d start with the world we’ve been living in for the last decade or so. According to an Ipsos survey last year, 59 percent of Americans think our country is in decline. Sixty percent believe “the system is broken.” Sixty-nine percent believe the “political and economic elite don’t care about hard-working people.” If those are your priors, then you’re going to be happy with a president who wields a wrecking ball.\n\nHealy: As Trump liked to say while campaigning, “What the hell do you have to lose?”\n\nBrooks: I’d add another phrase: “brokenism.” This is the belief system popularized by Alana Newhouse in Tablet magazine in 2022. It’s the idea that everything is broken and we just need to burn it all down. Personally, I think some things are broken and some things are OK, but most of my Trump-supporting friends are brokenists. They get this from media consumption. Do you remember that 2013 study that people who consumed a lot of media about the Boston Marathon bombing experienced “higher acute stress” than those who were actually at the bombing? There’s something about screens that contributes to a catastrophizing mind-set.\n\nDavid French: In addition to the brokenism that David talks about, there’s a strong undercurrent of raw animosity in our politics. Republicans and Democrats have very negative views of each other, and many Republicans (sadly!) want their opponents to suffer. They’re actually happy to see people lose their jobs or to see nonprofits lose funding if those people are perceived as part of the “deep state” or RINOs.\n\nSo, yes, Republicans want a disruptive president, but who’s being disrupted really matters — and if it’s the government or institutions that many Republicans believe are hostile to them, then Republicans are just fine with the pain. Many Republicans dislike foreign aid. Or loathe elite universities. Or hate big liberal law firms. Students and professors at elite universities have a long track record of targeting the free speech rights of their conservative colleagues, and Republicans are rationalizing their own constitutional violations as fighting fire with fire.\n\nHealy: That element of gleeful animosity comes through on Trump’s social media posts, David — like a “Take that!” smack, sticking it to universities or shutting down D.E.I. One of Trump’s most effective rallying cries in the last campaign was “I am your retribution.”\n\nRoss Douthat: I think there are all kinds of ways in which Trump’s popularity is connected to distinctive shifts in the culture in the last 15 years — the trends on both left and right that have boosted populists all over the Western world. But it’s also important to stress that part of what Republicans like about Donald Trump is just that Donald Trump is a Republican.\n\nHis biggest policy accomplishment so far is shutting down illegal immigration — something Republican voters strongly support. His signature legislative goal is extending his first-term tax cuts — a classic Republican policy goal. He wants to fire federal bureaucrats, downsize and devolve the Department of Education, cut regulations — this isn’t some populist rebuke of Ronald Reagan’s conservatism, this IS Ronald Reagan’s conservatism! So is picking fights with liberal judges and liberal universities. And if you told someone in, say, 2004 that a Republican president was stretching the boundaries of civil liberties to deport noncitizens accused of sympathizing with Hamas and Hezbollah, absolutely nobody would regard his popularity with G.O.P. voters as a puzzle in need of explanation.\n\nThere are important ways in which Trump’s style and tactics and some of his policy goals — the trade and tariff agenda, above all; foreign policy to some degree — are not old-school Republican politics as usual. But we shouldn’t exaggerate the break or make a deep mystery of why Republican voters would react favorably to much of what he’s doing.\n\nBret Stephens: Patrick, Alexander Hamilton supplied one part of the answer in Federalist No. 70: “Energy in the executive is a leading character in the definition of good government.” So leave to one side questions about what Trump is doing. What most Americans notice is that Trump is doing: bombing the Houthis, tariffing our neighbors, strong-arming President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, threatening Hamas, abolishing U.S.A.I.D. He’s the guy supporters and opponents alike struggle to keep pace with — while he grips their attention.\n\nA second part — and this is especially important for Trump critics like me to acknowledge — is that at least some of what he’s doing is succeeding. It is important that we finally have regained control over the southern border — proving, if nothing else, that we aren’t helpless in the face of these vast migratory flows. Getting rid of D.E.I. programs that had become a pervasive system of racial gerrymanders is, by my lights, another achievement. Demanding that Columbia University ban face-covering masks and enforce meaningful discipline on menacing and disruptive pro-Palestinian protesters in exchange for continued government funding strikes me as a good conclusion. And I really don’t think the nation will miss the Department of Education when it’s gone.\n\nBrooks: Bret, you now live in a country in which “tariffing” is a verb. I feel like this signifies the end of Western civilization. It started when consultants began using “learnings” as a noun. The path to perdition is slow, but accelerating.\n\nStephens: It’s a legit verb, David. For realz.\n\nFrench: I’m glad Bret brought up the border and the Houthis. These were two areas where the Biden administration failed (without good excuse), and the ease with which Trump pivoted to a different and better course highlights that many Democrats still don’t quite understand how poorly the Biden administration performed in its approach to both crises.\n\nHealy: And you’re seeing in poll numbers now that the Democratic Party is at a nadir in popularity. It boils down to trust, ideas and leadership.\n\nBrooks: I’d offer up one more word for consideration: “exclusion.” Progressives really have spent the last few decades excluding conservative and working-class voices from a lot of institutions. Trump has gone after these institutions big time — the universities, the Department of Education, the State Department. Of course, the MAGA crowd feels justified revenge.\n\nStephens: An important point, David. I know liberals love to point out that MAGA politicians like Ted Cruz, Tom Cotton, Josh Hawley and Elise Stefanik all went to Ivy League schools (as did Donald Trump, though I doubt it was on account of merit). But those campus conservatives were always ideological minorities at elite colleges, and it’s where they learned to loathe the contempt they felt coming from liberal professors and peers.\n\nDouthat: Fortunately, all of us have learned to rise above it instead.\n\nStephens: At the University of Chicago, Ross, I was almost a liberal. Almost. Relatively speaking.\n\nFrench: I never did, Ross. That’s why I sued so many universities during my litigation career, but always with an eye toward protecting constitutional rights, not denying them to my political opponents.\n\nBrooks: A lot of elite conservatives continue to struggle with what I call the near-abroad problem. They may dislike MAGA, but they (we) are mostly around progressives or moderates on a day-to-day basis, by virtue of being elite. These progressives sometimes make our teeth hurt. We react more strongly to minor sins of the people across campus than the major sins of the people far away. This is something I’m working on.\n\nHealy: I want to bear down on the idea that more Americans think the country is on the right track with Trump. I have three theories to stress-test with you — or else I want to hear your own.\n\nOne: Authoritarians are popular, until they aren’t — that’s how it works.\n\nTwo: The enthusiasm is a honeymoon stemming from the November election, where Democrats got a big comeuppance from Trump.\n\nThree: A lot of Americans think Trump is generally right in both his diagnosis and Rx of government — that nothing terribly bad is going to happen, that the State Department can run foreign aid and the Treasury and the states can run Education Department programs, that tariffs will be a net positive in the long run, and that for all the sound and fury (and illegality), Trump 2.0 is trying to help America avoid becoming like societies struggling with long-term decline, weak national identities and sclerotic economies.\n\nAnd I’m open for business on a fourth theory, or more.\n\nDouthat: First, I would stress that Trump is not terribly popular, and undoubtedly will become less so if the stock market trends down and recession fears mount. He has a commanding position within his party, but even at his apotheosis his approval ratings barely got over 50 percent.\n\nSecond, Americans lived through the first Trump term, when sky-is-falling rhetoric was commonplace, but the average American did not experience a crisis until Covid hit. Then, through the Biden term, the media dialed back the crisis rhetoric dramatically, but in reality, inflation soared, the border seemed wide open, the world became much more dangerous, and the president was manifestly incapable of doing his job. So, while you can make a plausible case that this time is different, that Trump is more empowered and therefore more dangerous, you should still expect many Americans to wait for proof of that in their daily lives before they immediately re-embrace his first term’s narrative of crisis.\n\nBrooks: I’d take you back to a 1971 Clint Eastwood movie, “Dirty Harry,” or a 1974 Charles Bronson movie, “Death Wish.” Both of those were produced in a time of social decay, and they’re both about a guy who is willing to break or bend the rules to restore order. To this day, there is a large chunk of Americans who think the system is so broken, we need someone who will break the rules. That’s what’s happening.\n\nPlus, the unfortunate fact is that there is almost always a kernel of truth to Trump & Co.’s assaults. The most noxious thing they have done in my view is eviscerate U.S.A.I.D. Millions will die. But it was true that U.S.A.I.D. was a bureaucratic nightmare. A generation of administrators there tried to fix it. The problem — which the Trumpies don’t understand — is that a lot of the sinecures were established by members of Congress who insisted they not be removed. Trump policies are not 100 percent wrong; they are just overreactions. Destroying an agency rather than fixing what is wrong and saving what is right.\n\nStephens: Unless you happen to live within a few miles of Capitol Hill, you probably don’t give two figs whether our (sometimes misspent) foreign aid is distributed via a semiautonomous agency called U.S.A.I.D. or directly through the State Department itself. You also probably think it’s no tragedy that government workers should experience the periodic layoffs that the rest of American workers have lived through since forever. The sort of inside-the-Beltway moves that feel like political earthquakes to a certain kind of Washington insider leave Trump voters somewhere between indifferent and pleased.\n\nThe other point that can’t be emphasized enough: Trump wouldn’t be as popular as he is with his side of the country if Democrats and progressives weren’t as unpopular with most sides of the country. Just the fact that he drives the Rachel Maddows of the world into fits of rage and despair and thoughts of European exile is reason enough for many Americans to support him. Sometimes even including me.\n\nFrench: Those of us who follow politics closely always seem to forget that we’re the strange ones. I really question how much the average rank-and-file Republican even knows about most of these early controversies. If you’re watching Fox News or other right-wing outlets, you’re hearing a lot of stories about strange, “woke” programs funded by U.S.A.I.D. They don’t know about the lives that are saved or the lives that are at risk.\n\nThat means they won’t know, much less care, about any given political controversy until it affects them personally.\n\nHealy: I want to return to a word I used in the last question: illegality. Democrats and plenty of independents, and not a few judges, see illegality or evidence of it in some of Trump’s actions on federal spending, agency dismantlement, deportations, defiance of judicial rulings. Why do some conservatives see illegality differently?\n\nDouthat: First, some of these moves are not obviously illegal, and exist in a zone of contestation over presidential power and constitutional interpretation where a normal partisan naturally takes his own side’s side.\n\nHealy: We’ll get to some specific moves a bit later. Go on.\n\nDouthat: Second, I would emphasize that many Americans experienced the recent period of liberal power, especially under Covidian conditions, as much more authoritarian and lawless-feeling in its everyday impact — schools closed and masks mandated, ideological double standards for different forms of public gathering and protest, ideological speech codes tacitly or explicitly imposed — than anything they experienced under Trump.\n\nThis sense of things may change as Trump pushes the envelope of presidential power or as the right embraces its own forms of censoriousness. Indeed, already you can see some factions that aligned with Trump because they were anti-woke start to break away or critique MAGA excesses.\n\nBut it’s still important to grasp that for many Americans, the fights over presidential prerogatives within the federal bureaucracy feel much more distant from their own liberties than liberalism’s recent agenda did.\n\nStephens: What I see is a president doing things that are, if not outright illegal, genuinely scary, like trying to go after the Washington law firm representing Jack Smith, the former special counsel. At a minimum, Trump represents an almost unprecedented stress test to the judicial system and the separation of powers. And if he starts openly defying Supreme Court rulings à la Andrew Jackson, that’s when you’ll find me at the barricades.\n\nThat said, some of what Trump is doing is simply a turbocharged version of what his liberal predecessors did while the mainstream press remained mostly mum. Remember Barack Obama’s threats of unilateral executive action through his phone and his pen? Or Joe Biden’s almost open flouting of the Supreme Court with his student loan forgiveness schemes? I also think millions of Americans are tuning out some of the claims of Trump’s unconstitutional behavior as so much partisan noise. That’s one of the downsides of some of the more doubtful efforts by liberal prosecutors to put Trump in jail.\n\nFrench: First, I sincerely doubt that most Republicans think or believe that Trump has done anything illegal so far. Right-wing media is full of legal talking heads telling their loyal audiences that the various district judges are lawless. The right is even attacking Amy Coney Barrett, calling her a grifter or a RINO for exercising her independent judgment.\n\nWe’ve seen this pattern throughout the Trump years. Trump will advance an illegal or unconstitutional policy, MAGA lawyers will spring to MAGA media to rationalize and justify it, and then, when even conservative judges or justices block Trump’s actions, they scream that the courts are lawless, not Trump.\n\nBrooks: As a matter of principle, Democrats should be screaming bloody murder about Trump’s threat to the Constitution. As a matter of political tactics, I think they’re better off emphasizing Trumpian incompetence. Determining the constitutionality of some act requires a law degree, but incompetence is something we all recognize — and there is a lot of it.\n\nHealy: On the economy, I ask in all seriousness: Are Republicans really OK if Trump drives America into a recession? Listening to Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, this week, stock market corrections are healthy and recessions may be sometimes necessary. Putting aside the macroeconomic finer points there, I’m confused that so many Republicans think we’re on the right track when that track may be leading to recession. Are they not paying attention?\n\nFrench: It’s so important to distinguish between the core of MAGA — which dominates discourse online — from the bulk of voters who put Trump back in the White House. Online MAGA will pay any price and bear any burden for Trump; they’ll even buy electric cars to keep the DOGE dream alive. But the people who actually made him president were primarily concerned about prices, and it wasn’t close. If the economy tanks, MAGA will stay with Trump, but we know from the 2020 election that enough voters will step off the Trump train to swing the balance of power back to the Democrats.\n\nDouthat: It’s not unique to MAGA, though — real partisans don’t change their vote just because the economy goes bad, and especially not under polarized conditions. It’s not like the inflation under Biden suddenly made partisan Democrats open to a vote for Trump. But as David says, Trump’s current coalition includes a lot of not-that-partisan nonloyalists who voted for him because they thought he’d be good for the economy, and those voters will be voting Democratic in the midterms without a second thought if we’re in a recession.\n\nBrooks: I do think Trump’s popularity will plummet if the economy really heads south. People will tolerate a lot from their government, but not unnecessary chaos.\n\nHealy: And not when Trump promised an economic boom from Day 1.\n\nBrooks: People forget how many voters like Trump mostly because he’s a businessman who, they think, knows how to “grow the economy” (speaking of words that should have never been verbs). If that myth is busted, things will head south fast. In fact, I worry the political momentum will shift so fast that the Democrats won’t be ready to take advantage. They’ll still be dealing with their own trauma, intellectual incoherence and recriminations. They won’t have time to offer something new, which is why parties recently have not reformed themselves after defeat. The other side screws up too fast.\n\nStephens: Well, Treasury Secretary Bessent is right. Market corrections are healthy. Recessions should sometimes happen. Having the government or the Federal Reserve ensure that markets only go up is the road to inflating bubbles that ought to be pricked, and to zombifying large parts of the economy that ought to be allowed to die. The practice by presidents of both parties to ensure that profits are privatized and risk is socialized is a road to ruin.\n\nThe problem is, trying to go about this by jacking up tariffs in incoherent and unpredictable ways is the worst possible way of pricking bubbles. But I wouldn’t be so sure that the economy is going to tank. Markets usually like deregulation, permitting reform, “Drill, baby drill,” an extension of the 2017 tax cuts. And Trump can always lift the tariffs. Like Soviet diplomacy under Andrei Gromyko, Trump has a gift for creating crises so that he can take credit for solving them.\n\nHealy: I’d like to do a lightning round and go through actions Trump has taken and learn if you agree or disagree with each of them — to help readers understand how the four of you with histories on the right see these issues. First: Trump’s negotiations with President Vladimir Putin of Russia to end the war in Ukraine.\n\nBrooks: Let’s not overthink this — siding with a villainous dictator against a brave democrat is repulsive. That said, I don’t think we’re going to return to the postwar international order. The 21st century was bound to look a lot different from the 20th. Those of us internationalists have some thinking to do.\n\nDouthat: Negotiating with Putin in some form is an absolute strategic necessity, given the situation of the war and American power overall. Which doesn’t mean that Trump will produce a good deal.\n\nFrench: Of all the outrages of Trump’s first two months, his betrayal of Ukraine is likely to be the most consequential. If he continues on this course, he’ll hand Russia a military victory, rip the heart out of the Western alliance, and place a diminished America in a bystander role as great power competition likely leads to nuclear proliferation and greater international instability.\n\nI agree with David that the 21st century is going to look different from the 20th. But this does not mean our alliances are somehow less valuable, and that it’s better for America to alienate Europe for the sake of embracing Russia.\n\nWe should want the European powers to increase defense spending as partners and friends, not as angry, estranged former allies. We need their help.\n\nStephens: Trump at his absolute worst. A betrayal of the free world and its courageous champions in Ukraine. A betrayal of the promises of the Atlantic Charter and 80 years of American global leadership against totalitarian aggression. And a portent of betrayal for every other small country — whether it’s Latvia, Taiwan or Israel — that looks to America for the protection of independence and liberty. I can only hope Putin’s refusal to agree to a cease-fire does something to sober Trump’s judgment.\n\nHealy: The federal government sending hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants to a prison in El Salvador, deciding they were gang members even as a federal judge was assessing their cases, and doing so even though the judge ordered the deportation flights to turn around and head back to the United States.\n\nStephens: I’d need to learn a few more details, but it sounds legally iffy. Still, not the hill Trump’s critics should want to die on.\n\nDouthat: Deporting gang leaders is good. But claiming wartime powers to go around the normal deportation system seems guaranteed — as in the War on Terror, to stress again Trump’s continuity with past Republicans — to yield abuses and mistakes, and that may have already happened in this case.\n\nHealy: Trump calling for the impeachment of that judge — and the notion of impeaching or disregarding judges generally whom Trump disagrees with.\n\nStephens: Terrible. I only stop to observe that all the liberals who went berserk over John Roberts’s nomination to the court 20 years ago owe the chief justice an apology, especially after his intervention in this case. He’s a model of conservative jurisprudence.\n\nDouthat: Trump’s rhetoric against his opponents, judicial or otherwise, always goes too far. But I think elected officials aggressively attacking judges who make aggressive rulings is a completely normal part of democratic politics in a country with a powerful judicial branch, and I would say the same about many sweeping liberal attacks on the Roberts court and its conservative justices in the last few years.\n\nBrooks: Atrocious. As usual, Trump is being patrimonialist — treating the U.S. government like his own family business.\n\nFrench: It’s not just dreadful, but it’s also part of a calculated attack on the role of the judiciary in the constitutional order. Russell Vought, Trump’s influential head of Office of Management and Budget, has said that the right “needs to throw off the precedents and legal paradigms that have wrongly developed over the last 200 years, and to study carefully the words of the Constitution and how the founders would have responded in modern situations to the encroachments of other branches.”\n\nBrooks: Pure cruelty. This is one of those issues where anecdotes prevail over reality. We need to be able to defeat China in a possible naval confrontation. Is this really what we should be thinking about?\n\nStephens: I don’t think the military was “cruel” when transgender people were barred from military service for the first seven and a half years of Barack Obama’s presidency. This is an example of the deep disconnect between the moral certitudes of the part of the country that rarely serves in the military and the cultural convictions of the part of the country that often does — and on whom we all depend for our safety.\n\nFrench: I see the matter primarily as a question of readiness, not rights. Medical transitions can be very physically challenging, sometimes including physically debilitating treatments. That can affect readiness a great deal. In that circumstance, the question is less about transgender status and more about the physical realities of complex medical procedures.\n\nDouthat: I will just say that the policy seems to be obviously within the commander in chief’s constitutional powers, and the judicial ruling to the contrary is a good example of why many conservatives don’t feel they need to take the wider run of anti-Trump rulings all that seriously.\n\nHealy: Here’s my last question — I’ve been asking a lot about specific policies. A lot of Republicans like what they are seeing. But are they missing the forest for the trees? Do the individual policies matter if America’s economy tanks, if there’s a constitutional crisis over defying court orders, if there’s geopolitical upheaval in Ukraine or Eastern Europe or Taiwan?\n\nDouthat: We are two months into the presidency, and we just lived through four years of dramatic global and domestic upheaval under a Democratic president whose manifest incapacity was deliberately concealed from the country. I have a million concerns about where this administration is going, but it’s a bit soon to attack the president’s supporters for being irrationally loyal.\n\nBrooks: Personally, I think Trump has set the world record for over-reading his mandate. I think his incompetence and bad character will drag him far lower this term than they did in his first. (This term, Trump is actually trying to do things.) But I wake up each morning and ask: What if I’m wrong? What if Trump wins the next four years? We’re entering an era of junkyard dog politics. Maybe Trump is the guy to stand up to Xi Jinping. Maybe governments need a pummeling cleanse before they can reinvent themselves. Maybe the vibe shift is permanent and the progressive march through the institutions is over. Maybe the American economy is a wonder to behold and it survives what Trump is throwing at it while our allies continue to stagnate.\n\nIf people like me focus on all the Trump failures that make us feel good, we may once again get run over by reality.\n\nFrench: The big disasters (or big triumphs) always swamp individual policies, and most people judge presidents through the prism of their own personal situation. That’s exactly why Jan. 6, 2021, didn’t end Trump’s political career. Very few voters liked it, but they didn’t see it as relevant to their lives — at least not nearly as relevant as the price of groceries or disorder in the streets.\n\nI completely agreed with the Democratic message that the rule of law was on the ballot in 2024, but I also know that voters will put up with an enormous amount of scandal and misconduct if the economy is strong and have no patience for corruption when the economy is weak. The “rule of law” is abstract. The price of eggs is concrete.\n\nThat’s why Trump’s incompetence is a greater threat to his presidency than his cruelty. A malicious man can win over the masses if jobs are plentiful and gas is cheap.\n\nStephens: On most days since Trump took office, the line that has run through my head is from the movie “Airplane!”: “Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue.” It’s just one damn thing after another.\n\nBut like David Brooks, I am a chastened Trump critic. I viewed his first term as a national embarrassment culminating in the epic disgrace of Jan. 6. Clearly, plenty of Americans didn’t see it my way, or they noticed things to which I was mostly indifferent: growing prosperity, a new attentiveness to the proverbial forgotten man — and the vapid, arrogant, hypocritical awfulness of many a Trump scold.\n\nSo, to adapt Larry David, I’m going to Curb My Nausea. Just please pass me the Dramamine, will you, Patrick?",

        "full_text": "The following content is sponsored by Americans for Limited Government.\n\nThe Trump administration should set its sights on the middlemen who drive up healthcare costs.\n\nIn his quest to eliminate wasteful federal spending, President Trump has a Cheesecake Factory-sized menu to choose from when it comes to healthcare. Once the Trump administration turns its attention to this sector, it will quickly discover that foreign aid was a mere appetizer to the fatty center of America’s bloated health apparatus.\n\nTake Medicaid, the government health program meant to provide coverage to low-income and disabled Americans. In 2023 alone, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office found the program lost $50 billion to “improper payments,” a term used to describe waste and fraud. That’s more than USAID’s total budget for the year.\n\nLast year, the Federal Trade Commission claimed that Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) “abused their economic power by rigging pharmaceutical supply chain competition in their favor, forcing patients to pay more for life-saving medication. According to the complaint, these PBMs, known as the Big Three, together administer about 80 percent of all prescriptions in the United States.” PBMs’ combined revenue is over $1 trillion. It equals 22 percent of national health expenditures. This begs the question, what makes American healthcare so different than the others – and the answer is clear – American healthcare is plagued by a labyrinth of middlemen insurance intermediaries driven by profits, instead of patient care.\n\nIn today’s world, providers and patients no longer have control of their healthcare and must constantly navigate the increased red tape stemming from healthcare supply chain middleman meddling. Middlemen continuously claim they are lowering American’s healthcare costs. So, one would think that Americans would get something for all this spending, but patient costs have actually soared.\n\nThe Biden administration made the problem worse by growing the healthcare system’s bureaucracy through laws like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The IRA raided Medicare to the tune of roughly $273 billion, with part of the savings being funneled to Big Insurance bailouts to mask the high cost of Obamacare plans.\n\nBut those middlemen just make the system less efficient. A recent study found that increased third-party healthcare spending leads to higher spending and waste. Without control over their dollars, patients lose their ability to make their own choices and shop for better prices.\n\nWho thrives on inefficiency, you may ask? Middlemen. Prescription drugs are a great case study. Believing the high cost of certain pharmaceutical products was due to a lack of government involvement, Biden’s IRA put federal bureaucrats in charge of “negotiating” pharmaceutical prices. However, the law willingly ignored a much bigger problem: the presence of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) who negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers and quietly pocket most of the resulting savings intended to go to patients.\n\nA 2024 U.S. Federal Trade Commission report found that “these powerful middlemen may be profiting by inflating drug costs and squeezing Main Street pharmacies.” The report noted that the three largest PBMs now manage nearly 80 percent of all prescriptions filled in the U.S. “As a result, [PBMs] wield enormous power and influence over patients’ access to drugs and the prices they pay.”\n\nThe 340B drug pricing program is another inefficiency that empowers middlemen over patients. Under 340B, hospitals can purchase discounted drugs for uninsured and low-income patients. However, 340B has become a hospital markup program. Many 340B hospitals and the PBMs they use to purchase the drugs have figured out how to game the system. CVS, one of the biggest PBMs, disclosed that it takes in massive profits from 340B.\n\nThe former CEO of a corporate chain pharmacy company said that the size of the 340B program was exploding and that they would “take full advantage.” “340B gross sales across the program are expected to grow from $116B in 2021 to $280B in 2026. We intend to take full advantage of the momentum this sector presents.”\n\nInstead of passing the discounted prices down to vulnerable patients, 340B hospitals charge patients or their insurer the full price of the drugs and either pocket the difference or share the proceeds with their PBM.\n\nThe middleman madness within the American healthcare system must stop. President Trump has an opportunity to expose how much PBMs and 340B abuses drive up U.S. healthcare spending. Congress should pass much-needed reforms that rein in this waste and protect patients.\n\nThe Trump administration should also find ways to reduce administrative spending in health care. In the way that Trump’s nominee to lead the FDA, Dr. Marty Makary, famously called attention to the wasteful habit of hospitals throwing away clean, single-use medical devices, this administration must blow the whistle on red tape that drives waste. Every dollar spent on administrative overhead is a dollar not being invested in patient care or the next generation of medical innovation.\n\nThe Trump administration can help patients by diverting resources away from programs that don’t make America healthy. Now is the time.",

        "full_text": "A pipeline company’s victory in court over Greenpeace, and the huge damages it now faces, will encourage other oil and gas companies to legally pursue environmental protesters at a time when Donald Trump’s energy agenda is in ascendancy, experts have warned.\n\nOn Wednesday a North Dakota jury ruled that three Greenpeace entities collectively must pay Energy Transfer, which was co-founded by a prominent Trump donor, more than $660m, deciding that the organizations were liable for defamation and other claims after a five-week trial in Mandan, near where the Dakota Access pipeline protests occurred in 2016 and 2017.\n\n“This verdict will embolden other energy companies to take legal action against protesters who physically block their projects,” said Michael Gerrard, the founder and faculty director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School.\n\n“It will chill those kinds of protests; whether the chilling goes beyond that remains to be seen. It won’t inhibit litigation against fossil fuel projects; we will surely see more of those as the Trump administration advances its ‘drill, baby, drill’ agenda.”\n\nKevin Cramer, the US senator from North Dakota, cheered Wednesday’s huge judgment against Greenpeace over the pipeline protests in his state, congratulating the energy company who sued the environmental group for its big win.\n\nJustice was served, he said. “They can think twice now about doing it again,” he said of Greenpeace and other environmental groups who protested against the Dakota Access pipeline.\n\nBrian Hauss, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, said that the lawsuit served as a “tax on speech”, one that makes it too expensive to go against “litigious, deep-pocketed corporations”.\n\n“If companies can sue critics, advocates and protesters into oblivion for their speech and the unlawful acts of third parties, then no one will feel safe protesting corporate malfeasance,” Hauss said.\n\nIn the days since the ruling was issued, environmental groups and protest movements have reacted with shock and dismay, warning that its impact stretches far beyond any individual organization.\n\nAmnesty International said the “devastating verdict sets an array of deeply damaging precedents on the rights to freedom of speech, association and peaceful protest and puts the very future of Greenpeace at risk”.\n\nSome legal experts were surprised the case even made it before a jury. Similar claims often get tossed out over first amendment concerns or because many states prevent so-called Slapp suits (strategic lawsuits against public participation). North Dakota doesn’t have an anti-Slapp law.\n\nGreenpeace’s goals – such as protecting the climate and preserving oceans – won’t change, said Sushma Raman, the interim executive director of Greenpeace USA. But “it’s really going to be a question of capacity and prioritization, which happens in any organization that is facing an existential threat of this kind,” Raman said.\n\n“Ultimately, this isn’t about the money for them,” Raman said of Energy Transfer. “It’s really about sending a message, and it’s trying to silence an organization that they feel is a thorn in their side.”\n\nEnergy Transfer’s CEO, Kelcy Warren, has donated millions to pro-Trump groups and given directly to the president’s campaigns over the years. He has made a mission of going after pipeline opponents, including Greenpeace, filing several lawsuits to that end.\n\nSome conservatives have celebrated his approach. Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, said it was “great news!” that the verdict could bankrupt Greenpeace. Erick Erickson, a conservative talkshow host, said Warren was his hero. “I’m a longtime shareholder of Energy Transfer and his campaign to destroy Greenpeace has been awesome to behold. God bless him,” Erickson wrote on X.\n\nShayana “Shane” Kadidal, a senior managing attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, called to mind economic boycotts during the US civil rights movement that inflicted damage on white-owned businesses, and how those businesses retaliated with civil lawsuits against groups such as the NAACP, trying to frame their activism as a conspiracy.\n\n“Billionaire oligarchs like Elon Musk and Energy Transfer’s Kelcy Warren now pose one of the most significant risks to free speech globally,” Kadidal said.\n\nGreenpeace began in the 1970s with a campaign led by Canadian activists to block nuclear weapons testing on an Alaskan island, its roots based in direct action. US offshoots grew throughout that decade. It is headquartered in the Netherlands, where it has filed an anti-Slapp lawsuit against Energy Transfer.\n\nIt has said it got involved in the Dakota Access protests because the tribe, the Standing Rock Sioux, asked for its help. The organization has a policy of only getting involved in Indigenous-led movements if specifically asked, the New York Times reported.\n\nWaniya Locke, of Standing Rock Grassroots, said the verdict “attempts to erase Indigenous leadership from Standing Rock’s history” and part of a “coordinated attack on communities organizing to protect their water and futures from big oil”.\n\nThe Greenpeace case isn’t the only recent example of a heightened legal attack on free speech. Protesters on US college campuses have been met with disciplinary actions for supporting Palestinian human rights, the most extreme example involving the push to deport a former Columbia student, Mahmoud Khalil. Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, has sued his critics.\n\nThe International Center for Not-for-Profit Law has tracked a rise in anti-protest bills since 2017, corresponding with major protest movements including actions against pipelines, on college campuses, for teachers and for racial justice. These proposals include “extreme” penalties for protest-related offenses like trespassing near a pipeline, the center notes in its analysis. They also call for expanded liability for organizations or individuals that aren’t directly involved in protests. “Non-profits, religious groups, and others will be much more reluctant to support or organize protected protests if they face possible penalties for the unlawful actions of others,” the center said in its analysis.\n\nThe verdict is not the end for this case – Greenpeace has said it will appeal to the North Dakota supreme court. Legal experts believe the organization has a better shot on appeal, citing the jury’s ties to the oil and gas industry and the broad disapproval of the protest among local residents.\n\nIn the defeat, there has also been resolve.\n\n“You can’t sue or bankrupt a movement,” Raman said.",

        "full_text": "Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino.\n\nQuick Take\n\nIn 2017, President Donald Trump expressed admiration for Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s deadly war on drug suspects. But social media posts have falsely claimed that Trump has ordered Duterte’s release from the International Criminal Court, where he faces charges of crimes against humanity. We could find no response from Trump regarding Duterte’s arrest.\n\nFull Story\n\nFormer Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested by police in Manila on March 11 and was flown to The Hague, where he faces charges of crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court.\n\nA March 12 ICC press release said the court “found reasonable grounds to believe that Mr Duterte is individually responsible as an indirect co-perpetrator for the crime against humanity of murder, allegedly committed in the Philippines” between November 2011 and March 2019.\n\nICC judges “found that there was an attack directed against a civilian population pursuant to an organisational policy while Mr Duterte was the head of the Davao Death Squad (DDS), and pursuant to a State policy while he was the President of the Philippines. Moreover, there are reasonable grounds to believe that this attack was both widespread and systematic: the alleged attack took place over a period of several years and resulted in thousands of deaths,” the press release said.\n\nThe ICC charges refer to Duterte’s anti-drug war during his years as mayor of Davao and as Philippine president, when more than 6,000 suspects were killed without trial by Duterte’s police during anti-drug operations.\n\nDuterte has said he did not authorize extrajudicial killings, but he “openly threatened drug suspects with death and ordered law enforcers to shoot suspects, who threaten them with harm,” the Associated Press reported in a 2022 article.\n\nDuterte’s war on drugs drew the admiration of Donald Trump during his first term as president. The New York Times reported that Trump told Duterte in a 2017 phone call, “I just wanted to congratulate you because I am hearing of the unbelievable job on the drug problem. Many countries have the problem, we have a problem, but what a great job you are doing and I just wanted to call and tell you that,” Trump said.\n\nBut since Duterte’s extradition to the Netherlands by the ICC, social media posts have fabricated claims about Trump’s response to Duterte’s arrest.\n\nA March 13 Facebook post falsely claimed, in part, “President Donald Trump has reportedly signed an executive order demanding the immediate release of former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte from the custody of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. Sources close to the White House claim that Trump, calling Duterte ‘a great friend and a tough guy,’ acted swiftly after Duterte’s arrest.”\n\nThe post went on to wrongly claim there was an “Executive Order 2025-03: Restoration of Justice for Allied Leaders,” saying that it “declares that the ICC has ‘no right to meddle in the affairs of strong leaders doing their jobs.’ The document allegedly mandates that U.S. forces stationed in Europe ‘extract and return’ Duterte to the Philippines within 48 hours, threatening economic sanctions against the Netherlands if the ICC fails to comply.”\n\nAnother Facebook post — which includes an image of Trump with Duterte generated with artificial intelligence — refers to the same fictional executive order and claims it calls for the deployment of “a specialized unit of U.S. Navy SEALs” to the Netherlands to extract Duterte “with all necessary equipment, firepower, and authority to get the job done.”\n\nBut there is no record of any such executive order or presidential action by Trump related to Duterte’s arrest. One red flag in these posts is the number of the supposed EO: “2025-03.” That’s not how executive orders are numbered. The Federal Register publishes all executive orders, and they are easily searchable through the American Presidency Project’s website.\n\nIn addition, we could not find any reports of Trump issuing a statement in response to the ICC arrest of the former Philippine president. We reached out to the White House for comment on the social media claims but did not receive a response.\n\nThe Philippines-based fact-checking website Vera Files debunked similar social media claims that were misleadingly presented as if they were from a BBC News report. Vera Files said, “There are no verified records of Trump or any other official U.S. government agency” expressing support for Duterte following his arrest.\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Meta to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

        "full_text": "“Elon Musk is out of control, and now the power-hungry billionaire is unloading millions to buy the Wisconsin Supreme Court,” the ad’s narrator says, citing the more than $7 million that a Musk-backed super PAC has dropped on the race. “He knows corrupt politician Brad Schimel is for sale and will abolish the checks and balances that protect us.”\n\nThe Musk-centric ad blitz is the latest evidence that Democrats believe the billionaire is a more potent line of attack than tying Republicans to President Donald Trump — and the results out of Wisconsin could affect how Democrats deploy Musk-related messaging in legislative elections in New Jersey and Virginia this year and in the midterms in 2026.\n\nArmed with private and public polling, Democrats in Wisconsin see Musk as an animating force that could compel Democratic-leaning and independent voters to back Susan Crawford, the Dane County judge who’s running against Schimel.\n\n“Democrats are furious about Musk, and independents are increasingly freaked out about the way that Musk is attacking things like Social Security and childhood brain cancer research,” said Ben Wikler, chair of the state Democratic Party. “Our test of our first Musk ad found that it moved likely 2025 voters by 6.2 percentage points.”\n\nIn Wisconsin, Wikler added, “we have a chance to demonstrate in this race that his money is politically toxic.”\n\nMusk looms unusually large in Wisconsin. Unlike Trump, he has directly intervened in the race through his super PAC, America PAC. Tesla, one of Musk’s companies, is also suing Wisconsin to challenge a state law forbidding it from opening dealerships in the state, a case that could go before the state Supreme Court.\n\nIn an April 1 election of an off-year, juicing participation among the base is the strategy for both parties. For Wisconsin Democrats, 97 percent of their party’s voters disapprove of Musk, according to a recent Marquette University survey.\n\n“These attacks on Musk are going to find a very receptive Democratic base of voters,” said Charles Franklin, who leads the Marquette University polling. “This is how they’re nationalizing the race, in hopes that party polarization will be enough and that it’ll boost Democratic turnout.”\n\nBut even some Democrats have warned against leaning too hard on Musk. Mandela Barnes, the state’s former lieutenant governor who lost a bid for Senate in 2022, said the ads may be “effective,” but that “my only fear here is that Elon Musk just won’t be enough because the question is still, ‘Well, what are Democrats doing besides saying how bad Elon Musk is? When will Dems actually show up?’”\n\nWikler argued that the ads “connect Musk’s corruption to the attacks on people’s lives,” like the potential cuts to Social Security, because “one of the biggest lessons from 2024 is to constantly bring out communication back to the things in voters’ lives they care most about.”\n\nRepublicans, too, are seeking to nationalize the Wisconsin campaign. They’ve held a two-to-one financial advantage in outside spending over pro-Crawford groups, with $22 million backing Schimel compared to $11 million supporting Crawford, according to a POLITICO analysis. But Democrats, using state party money, lead Republicans in pro-Crawford TV ad spending, $30.5 million to $26.3 million so far, according to AdImpact, an ad-tracking firm.\n\nRepublicans have tied Crawford to liberal mega-donor George Soros and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who have both donated in the race. Mailers sent by the Musk-backed super PAC to voters said Schimel “will support” Trump’s agenda.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. and Turning Point Action founder Charlie Kirk headlined a rally for Schimel this week, with Trump Jr. warning voters that his father’s “presidency can be put to a halt with this vote.” Trump himself has not yet endorsed in the race.\n\n“What people want to know about the Supreme Court candidates is all about crime, so [Schimel] is using his law enforcement background to focus on crime and safety, which is exactly what he should be doing,” said Mark Graul, a Republican consultant in Wisconsin who has worked on several other state Supreme Court races. “Then, through micro-targeting, do what you can to turn out those irregular April voters who are Trump supporters.”\n\nIn a statement, Schimel’s communications director Jacob Fischer said: “Susan Crawford was caught attempting to sell congressional seats to out-of-state billionaires for campaign contributions, prompting the support of extremists like George Soros and JB Pritzker. The attempts by Susan Crawford and the Democrats to distract the people of Wisconsin from her extreme views and the radical billionaires funding her are a mockery of hypocrisy.”\n\nBut it’s Musk — and Democrats’ effort to yoke him to Schimel — that will be dominating the airwaves on behalf of Democrats in the closing weeks, even as abortion and public safety have also been emphasized in TV ads. A second ad, backed by the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, uses audio of Schimel saying he needs to “invest in knee pads” because he has to “crawl around begging people” to financially support his bid. The ad then cuts to images of Musk, who “needs a guaranteed vote” on the state Supreme Court because he’s “suing the state of Wisconsin.”\n\n“Schimel begged, and Musk unloaded $10 million to rig the court,” the ad’s narrator says. “So how much does it cost to buy off a corrupt politician? Just ask Brad Schimel.”\n\nInternal Democratic data found that this ad was especially effective at chipping away at Schimel’s favorability, reducing it by 14 percent among moderate voters.\n\n“Republicans seem to be operating with this fantasy that Musk’s millions can protect them from voters that are enraged by attacks on things they depend on to keep a roof over their head,” Wikler said. “But that fantasy is about to be put to the only real test, which is what happens at the ballot box.”\n\nBut Republicans argued that the long-term efficacy of tying Republicans to Musk may not pay off for Democrats.\n\n“It may be effective in a special because it’s a base play, trying to demonstrate they’re fighting back against Trump. But it’s not plausible long term,” said Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster who is not involved in the Wisconsin race. “Trump could push Musk to the side at any time, if they determine he’s a millstone and that takes away their attack, so to think this is going to have an impact on the 2026 elections, it’s way too premature.”",

        "full_text": "Republicans are not the only lawmakers facing confrontational town halls over the congressional recess. Democratic lawmakers are increasingly facing the ire of the party’s liberal base over their response to the Trump administration.\n\nRep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.) clashed with pro-Palestinian attendees at a town hall Wednesday, leading police to shut down the forum. That followed Rep. Glenn Ivey’s (D-Md.) town hall Tuesday, where he faced criticism for being too “calm” in the face of the Trump administration. And in California, Democratic Rep. Gil Cisneros faced constituents angry about Social Security, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, potential cuts to Medicaid and fired federal workers.\n\n“I wish you’d be angry,” one woman said, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nAnd it’s not just House Democrats in safe districts taking heat from liberal constituents. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) responded to frustrated constituents at a town hall Wednesday by saying that her job is to be “more than just an activist” and that “yelling” from progressives has not stopped President Trump.\n\nThe raucous events come as Democrats have sought to use town halls to target GOP lawmakers in their own districts. The town halls have Republicans and Democrats on edge, as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are put on the defensive on home turf.\n\n“If you’re home, my town halls look like a Republican town hall. I’m not taking it personally. People are scared. They want to see us do something,” Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) told CBS News’s “Face the Nation” over the weekend.\n\nThe confrontations also come as Democrats continue to struggle to find their footing during the second Trump administration. And recent polling paints a dismal picture of the state of the party.\n\nAn NBC News poll released Sunday found that only 27 percent of voters said they had a positive view of the Democratic Party, while 55 percent of voters said they have a negative view of it. Additionally, 20 percent of Democrats in the poll said they had a negative view of the party.\n\nA separate CNN poll also released Sunday had similar findings, showing the party with a record-low 29 percent favorability rating. Fifty-two percent of Democratic-aligned adults said the leadership of the Democratic Party is currently taking the party in the wrong direction, compared to 48 percent who said the party’s leaders were taking them in the right direction.\n\nThis week’s town halls appeared to be a manifestation of that data.\n\n“[Democratic leadership] neglects to see the army of pitchforks behind them ready to fight back if they’re willing to take action,” said Sawyer Hackett, a progressive Democratic strategist.\n\n“Right now, what we’re seeing is those pitchforks aren’t necessarily on our side,” he continued. “Their anger is pointed at Democratic lawmakers.”\n\nThere is growing frustration from Democrats across the ideological spectrum over Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), along with nine other Senate Democrats, helping Republicans advance a House GOP-drafted government funding resolution. Liberals had hoped the Democrats would use the Senate filibuster to block the bill.\n\n“We’ve had one source of leverage to push back on these people and do everything we can to grind the gears of government to a halt to fight back, and we didn’t use it,” Hackett said.\n\nEven Democrats who voted against the resolution in their respective chambers, like Ivey and Slotkin, have faced tough questions over the future of their party at town halls.\n\n“Voting the right way is literally the least you can do,” said Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. “The expectation is that Democratic elected officials proactively do things to show that they get that we’re in an existential fight for the future of America.”\n\n“Anybody on the inside who does not understand that their role in this moment in time is to be an organizer in addition to a policymaker, is failing to meet the moment. That’s an absolute fact,” Green said.\n\nOne attendee at Ivey’s town hall Tuesday told the congressman that his constituents “want him to show fight, and you are not fighting.”\n\n“It’s not that you’re in the minority, it’s that you’re not even working on a shared strategy, and that is failure,” the attendee shouted, garnering applause.\n\n“The message you should clearly take to your colleagues from your constituents is this: We are not interested in hearing that you’re in the minority. We know that. We want you to show some of the backbone and strategic brilliance that Mitch McConnell would have in the minority,” the attendee said.\n\nProgressives say Democratic officials and lawmakers need to take Trump and Musk head on, not just through votes.\n\n“I wish more Democratic lawmakers would call for boycotts of Musk’s products,” Hackett said. “I wish more Democratic lawmakers would pressure their Democratic states to cut contracts with SpaceX, to cut contracts with Starlink, to cut contracts with Tesla charging stations.”\n\n“Democratic leadership seems to think that they can just lay low and point at Republicans until the midterms,” he said.\n\nDemocratic strategist Antjuan Seawright noted Democrats are “fighting with alligator arms tied behind their back in this case,” but said the key battle will be at the ballot box in 2026.\n\n“We’ve got to keep our eye on the bigger prize, and that’s winning elections, because that’s how we change the tone,” he said. “But it doesn’t mean that leaders in our party get a free pass on making bad political decisions.”\n\nRepublican lawmakers are also grappling with viral videos emerging from heated town halls. Republicans have blamed the interruptions on Democratic agitators, and earlier this month House GOP leadership urged members to hold virtual events or telephone town halls as opposed to in-person events. Democrats have used the opportunity to put their Republican counterparts on defense by traveling to GOP districts to hold town halls.\n\n“What we are seeing in town halls across the country is a rejection of the failed Republican agenda, and it’s why vulnerable House Republicans are hiding from their constituents. They know they are witnessing the beginning of the end of their majority,” said Viet Shelton, a spokesperson at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nProgressives say there are Democratic lawmakers who are taking a step in the right direction. A number of Democratic senators have gone on the offense this week, holding town halls in GOP House districts within their respective states.\n\n“If one is reading tea leaves, the willingness of Democratic senators to go to House Republican districts within their state and step on toes to fight for the future of America, is hopefully a good signal of backbone to come,” Green said.\n\nProgressive figures such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) are taking matters into their own hands, hitting the road on their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour. Sanders told The New York Times on Thursday that a goal of the tour is to encourage more people to “run as independents outside of the Democratic Party.”\n\nAt the Las Vegas stop of the tour Thursday with Rep. Steven Horsford (D-Nev.), Ocasio-Cortez told attendees to “look at every level office around and support brawlers who fight.”\n\n“Because those are the ones who can actually win against Republicans. Let’s be real about that,” she said.",

And now when caught, they just shrug and say they were lying all along.\n\nOnce it was known that the first COVID-19 case originated in or near a Chinese communist virology lab engineering gain-in-function deadly viruses -- with help from Western agencies -- the left went into full persecution mode.\n\nThey damned as incompetent, racist, and conspiratorial any who dared follow logic and evidence to point out that the Chinese government and its military were both culpable for the virus and lying.\n\nA million Americans died of COVID. Millions more suffered long-term injuries. Still, the left-wing media and Biden administration demonized any who dared speak about a lab origin of the deadly virus.\n\nThe lies were designed to protect the guilty who had helped fund the virus's origins, such as Doctors Anthony Fauci and Francis Collins.\n\nThe Biden government also tried to use the lab theory to ridicule a supposedly pro-Trump \"conspiracy.\"\n\nWestern corporate interests deeply invested in China did not want their partner held responsible for veritably killing and maiming hundreds of millions worldwide.\n\nAlmost as soon as Joe Biden was inaugurated, the left knew that he was physically and mentally unable to serve as president.\n\nIndeed, that was the point.\n\nBiden's role was designed as a waxen figurine for hard-left agendas that, without the \"old Joe Biden from Scranton\" pseudo-moderate veneer, could never have been advanced.\n\nHis handlers operated a nightmare administration: the destruction of deterrence abroad, two theater wars, 12 million illegal aliens, a weaponized justice system, hyperinflation, and $7 trillion more in debt.\n\nBy 2017, the public knew three truths about the so-called Christopher Steele dossier.\n\nOne, it was completely fallacious -- fabricated by a has-been, ex-British spy Christopher Steele. He childishly had cobbled together lurid sex stories, James Bond spy fictions, and Russian-fed disinformation to destroy the Trump candidacy and later presidency.\n\nTwo, it was paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign. She hid her checks behind the Democratic National Committee, the Perkins Coie law firm, and Fusion GSP paywalls.\n\nThree, the FBI under James Comey hired Steele as an informant. It helped disseminate his concocted files and was also instrumental in trying to subvert the Trump campaign and later administration.\n\nNo sane person ever believed that Hunter Biden's laptop was the work of \"Russian disinformation.\" Its contents a year before the 2020 election were verified by the FBI, but it kept mum about its confirmation.\n\nThe pornographic pictures, the evidence of prostitution and drug use, the electronic communications implicating Joe Biden in his family's illicit shake-down operation of foreign governments -- all were never challenged by anyone who was associated with the laptop's contents.\n\nYet future Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, along with former interim CIA Director Mike Morrell, sought to fabricate a colossal lie to arm their candidate, Joe Biden, with plausible denial in the last presidential debate before the 2020 election.\n\nThey rounded up a rogue's gallery of 51 now utterly discredited former intelligence authorities to lie to the nation that the laptop was likely fake.\n\nAll knew the FBI had verified the laptop. But they also knew that their titles would empower their lies that the Russians likely invented the laptop to aid the sinister Trump.\n\nAnd the ruse worked like a charm.\n\nIn the debate, Biden cited their lies chapter and verse to claim the incriminating laptop was fake. A lying media damned Trump as a puppet of Vladimir Putin. Biden, little more than a week later, won the 2020 election.\n\nThe Biden administration deliberately destroyed the southern border and welcomed 12 million illegal aliens. And then it lied that Biden had no power to stop the influx.\n\nThe media fabricated the excuse that \"comprehensive immigration reform\" was needed to enforce federal immigration laws already on the books.\n\nUpon inauguration, Trump, in a matter of days, stopped what Biden had deliberately engineered for years.\n\nBiden's handlers wanted new millions of poor illegal aliens, dependent on social services, to swarm the borders.\n\nThey saw them as future voters and constituents to fuel their victim/victimizer Marxist binaries.\n\nAnd they now quietly see their efforts as a huge success -- knowing that it will be near impossible to find the millions of illegal aliens they welcomed in.\n\nAll these lies have divided the country and permanently damaged the U.S.\n\nThe perpetrators have neither apologized for their lies nor tried to either deny or substantiate them.\n\nNo one involved has ever been held legally accountable.\n\nThe legacy media permanently ruined its reputation and will likely never be seen as credible again.\n\nThe Biden administration, overseer of many of these lies, will be regarded as the most duplicitous and dishonest presidency in modern history.",

        "full_text": "MIAMI (AP) — In Hialeah, Florida, a city that’s 95% Hispanic, only three residents showed up at a recent city council meeting to speak against a partnership with the federal government to enforce immigration laws.\n\nThe police departments in Hialeah, where three out of four people were born abroad, and Coral Gables, with a majority of Hispanics mostly of Cuban descent, have entered into agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement with very little visible pushback.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s doubling of immigration arrests and ramping up of deportations could have a disproportionate impact on South Florida, home to some of the nation’s largest communities of Cubans, Venezuelans and other Latin Americans. But reaction here to Trump’s crackdown has been far more muted than during his first term, reflecting both the rightward shift of Latino voters and a belief among some that restrictive border measures are necessary.\n\n“I understand some people feel a little bit betrayed because most of us voted him in,” said Frank Ayllon, a 41-year-old sales representative from Miami. “I feel like a lot of these people are taking it very personal. And it’s not personal. It’s just that you’ve got to understand that this has been an open border for many years.”\n\nAyllon echoed Trump’s attacks on former President Joe Biden, whose administration saw record-high illegal border crossings before falling by the end of his term. Having once been critical Trump’s 2020 election lies, Ayllon now says he thought the president has had the most action-packed beginning of a term he has ever seen.\n\nA political shift begins to stick\n\nWhen Miami-Dade County ordered jail officials in 2017 to hold people suspected of being in the U.S. illegally, dozens lined up to speak against the order at a public meeting, with some shouting “shame on you.” Lawmakers including former Vice President Kamala Harris, then California’s junior senator, joined large protests outside a local immigrant detention facility.\n\nNow in Trump’s second term, the protest movement is splintered. But there’s also been a broader political shift in South Florida and Latino communities.\n\nWhile Harris in the 2024 presidential election won more than half of Hispanic voters, that support was down slightly from the roughly 6 in 10 Hispanic voters that Biden won in 2020. Roughly half of Latino men voted for Harris, down from about 6 in 10 who went for Biden.\n\nIn the November election, 7 in 10 Hispanic voters in Florida said they favored reducing the number of immigrants who were allowed to seek asylum in the U.S. when they arrived at the U.S. border, according to AP VoteCast. That was in line with Florida voters overall.\n\nIn 2024, Trump won not just Miami-Dade County but the central Florida counties of Seminole and Osceola, where many Venezuelans have immigrated, and made inroads in heavily Puerto Rican areas of Pennsylvania. He also flipped several South Texas border counties that were Democratic bastions for decades.\n\nWhat initially catapulted Trump’s popularity in South Florida was his stance on the socialist governments that many exiles and their families fled, along with his focus on boosting growth and reducing prices. But at a rally in Miami days before announcing his third White House bid in November 2022, Trump said that, contrary to the belief of some, Hispanics liked his vows to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\n“When I talked about the border, you know who the biggest fans of that were? (they) were the Hispanics, Latinos,” Trump said. “They knew more about the border than anybody. They knew more about it. Everybody said, ‘Oh, he’s going to hurt himself with Hispanics.’ Actually, it turned out to be the exact opposite.”\n\nBarbara Canales, a 49-year-old certified nursing assistant who lives in Hialeah, said her mother brought her as a young girl from Honduras with a visa and overstayed it. It took them many years to legalize their status and to be able to bring other family members.\n\n“That’s why I totally agree that you need to take illegal immigrants out of the United States. I’m sorry, but they should do it,” Canales said, adding that she feels most of the migrants arriving in the past few years are different. “When you come in with a visa is a totally different story.”\n\nCanales says that while the Republican president has made immigration his signature issue, previous Democratic administrations have been just as willing to enforce immigration laws and deport people who had built their lives in the U.S. Former President Barack Obamaearned the nickname “deporter in chief” from advocacy groups who opposed his use of enforcement.\n\n“It’s the reality that if you’re here breaking the rules, you have to suffer the consequences,” Canales said.\n\nMiami’s Cuban exiles are split\n\nMiami is particularly well-known for its community of Cuban exiles who originally fled the government of communist leader Fidel Castro. About two-thirds of Cuban voters in Florida supported Trump in 2024, according to AP VoteCast, while about one-third supported Harris.\n\nCubans have long prided themselves of arriving here legally through several refugee and family-based programs and have been able to get green cards easier than people from other countries, thanks to a Cold War-era law.\n\nAfter Obama in 2017 ended the “wet foot, dry foot” policy that considered any Cuban who set foot on dry land to be automatically a legal arrival, Cubans leaving for the U.S. have found more obstacles.\n\nIt did not stop many from coming.\n\nBetween 2021 and 2022, the U.S. government recorded the largest flight of Cuban exiles since the Mariel boatlift in 1980, when nearly 125,000 Cubans came to the U.S. over a six-month period.\n\n“We are all in favor of legal immigration. My parents are products of legal immigration, like many of your parents, if not you directly,” said Hialeah Mayor Esteban Bovo, a strong Trump ally, during the recent city council meeting about an ICE partnership.\n\nTrump picked up support from new Cuban immigrants such as Luis Boulart, 85, who arrived in 2015, got his citizenship in 2022 and cast his first presidential vote for Trump in 2024. Boulart recently said he trusted the president and believed the Republican party could better handle immigration, the economy, immigration and foreign policy.\n\n“I think the challenges ahead are huge. But he is capable of solving all the problems,” Boulart said.\n\nBut those policy changes have meant more recent arrivals have a tougher path to legal status than preceding generations did.\n\nJulian Padron, a 79-year-old who said he was jailed in Cuba, arrived decades ago when President Jimmy Carter negotiated with Castro the release of hundreds of political prisoners to the United States. He said he feels strongly against Trump and considers his actions anti-democratic.\n\nHe frequents Domino Park, located on Calle Ocho in Miami’s iconic Little Havana, where a lot of the players sitting at four-person tables on a recent day were supportive of Trump. Padron said he typically keeps his thoughts to himself unless he is asked for his opinion. A park employee first told an Associated Press reporter that political questions were not allowed at this park to avoid arguments. But when asked which directive forbade that, the employee said he would find out and then allowed the interviews to continue.\n\n“They are going to be detaining people,” Padron said, looking around the park. “Do they not know that people are still fleeing communism?”",

If it's the bad guys, I've got to go out with my gun and try to protect my family,\" Pagliarulo said.\n\nDispatchers confirmed the sheriff's office received a 911 call about a hostage situation with multiple dogs shot, apparently pretending to be Pagliarulo.\n\nTRUMP CABINET NOMINEES, APPOINTEES TARGETED WITH ‘VIOLENT, UNAMERICAN THREATS’\n\nThe swatter claimed someone was \"bleeding out upstairs\" and to \"please hurry and get inside,\" making the situation even more tense for both deputies responding.\n\n\"That's the thing. Not one of those things was happening,\" Pagliarulo said. \"My family was peacefully sleeping. I was working in my office. Nothing was going wrong in my house. But this guy, wherever he happened to be, was trying to get police to break down the door and possibly either kill me or scare us enough to where I would shut my mouth and not do what I do on the radio every day.\"\n\nWhile deputies defused the situation, Pagliarulo said, \"Your heart flops out of your chest.\"\n\nSWATTING ADVANCED FROM PRANK CALLS TO ‘DIGITAL TERRORISM’: EXPERT\n\nPagliarulo said he immediately texted Patel, who put out a statement about swatting the next day.\n\n\"I want to address the alarming rise in ‘Swatting’ incidents targeting media figures,\" Patel wrote in a social media post Friday. \"The FBI is aware of this dangerous trend, and my team and I are already taking action to investigate and hold those responsible accountable.\"\n\nHe added the issue isn’t about politics.\n\n\"Weaponizing law enforcement against ANY American is not only morally reprehensible but also endangers lives, including those of our officers,\" Patel wrote. \"That will not be tolerated. We are fully committed to working with local law enforcement to crack down on these crimes.\"\n\nOther conservative media figures, including podcaster Nick Sortor and host Shawn Farash, reported similar swatting incidents on the same day last week as Pagliarulo, while InfoWars host Owen Shroyer uploaded a nearly 13-minute video to Wednesday sharing that he was \"just swatted.\"\n\nA bipartisan, bicameral bill was introduced in January to strengthen penalties against those found guilty of making swatting calls, imposing prison sentences of up to 20 years for false calls resulting in serious injury or death.\n\nFEDS CHARGE 2 EUROPEANS WITH ‘SWATTING’ PLOT TARGETING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, OTHER ELECTED OFFICIALS\n\nBill cosponsor Rep.

        "full_text": "“There is a need to be able to communicate across the political spectrum. I think every university is trying to find people from the moderate to right — and even more right — in the political spectrum to help deliver messages and help protect them from unfair and problematic attacks,” said Lee Bollinger, the former president of Columbia University. “I’m seeing it more and more.”\n\nColumbia is at the center of the fight, facing a $400 million funding freeze as federal immigration agents moved to deport a former student with a green card and are combing campus looking for other non-citizen students who, the White House claims, supported Hamas during last spring’s pro-Palestinian student protests. Beilock, Dartmouth’s president, previously served as president of Barnard College, a Columbia affiliate institution and the current center of continuing protest activity at the university.\n\nThe Trump administration on Wednesday froze $175 million in funding to the University of Pennsylvania over its transgender athlete policies. Cornell and Yale are under investigation for allegedly prioritizing doctoral applicants from underrepresented backgrounds. And the administration has launched probes into alleged antisemitism at Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Princeton and Yale.\n\nDartmouth — the smallest Ivy League college, tucked away in rural New Hampshire and known for being less progressive than many of its peers — is the only school in the conference that appears to so far have escaped the administration’s wrath.\n\n“We’ve done a good job in the past of permitting free expression and respecting others’ voices,” said Phil Hanlon, who served as Dartmouth’s president before Beilock. “We’ve worked hard at that over many decades.”\n\nRaymer’s history on immigration could be where he faces the greatest opposition on campus, as his hiring appears to prioritize the political realities over universities’ long-held values. Universities have faced increasing pressure from students and advocates to answer questions about how they will protect students amid the president’s immigration crackdown, as Trump has changed policy to allow immigration enforcement at schools and fears percolate about data protection for undocumented students, as well those who have parents living in the country illegally.\n\n“This general counsel and his views on birthright citizenship are horrifying … and just seeing that advertised at their university, it might make students more fearful,” said Elaine Maimon, a former university administrator, adding that universities are being targeted and must seek a wide range of advice to protect their students. “If I was sitting there making the decision, I’d have to weigh whether the strategic use of his advice to protect the student was worth upsetting them.”\n\nDartmouth said last month it is not changing any of its immigration policies in response to the Trump administration’s actions, but that a group of university leaders is meeting every week to review policy and how it might affect campus, according to New Hampshire Public Radio. The college has encouraged students to reach out to their “dean or supervisor” with questions, or to seek additional support in the Office of Visa and Immigration Services (which has long been overseen by the college’s top lawyer). Dartmouth has also recently encouraged immigrant and international students to ensure they’re carrying proper documentation while traveling given increased enforcement and anticipated travel restrictions, as even some people with legal status have been deported or detained in recent weeks.\n\nRaymer, a Dartmouth graduate, authored a piece published in the Federalist in January, arguing that “Trump is right about birthright citizenship” and that children born to undocumented immigrants are not entitled to citizenship under the 14th Amendment. The president tried to end birthright citizenship on his first day in office, despite broad legal consensus that the Constitution grants American citizenship to nearly everyone born on U.S. soil. He was quickly blocked in the courts.\n\nDartmouth spokesperson Jana Barnello said Raymer brings “extensive legal expertise, sound judgement” and a “deep personal commitment to his alma mater.” She added that he is eager to “strengthen relationships” across the college and ensure Dartmouth remains a place of “academic excellence, ideological diversity, and exploration.” As general counsel, she said he will provide guidance and support Dartmouth’s legal strategy under the direction of the president, but that he “does not set policy.”\n\n“Dartmouth’s approach to legal matters has always been consistent, reflecting the institution’s commitment to its academic mission and its responsibilities under the law,” the spokesperson said.\n\nAnd on birthright citizenship, Barnello said Raymer’s opinion piece presented a “scholarly legal argument” on a widely discussed topic, adding that it is “separate from Matt Raymer’s responsibilities as Dartmouth’s General Counsel. Like all its senior leaders, Dartmouth has full confidence in Matt’s ability to serve in this role based on his qualifications and expertise, without regard to any personal political beliefs.”\n\nRaymer’s hire appears to be part of an effort to keep Dartmouth out of the path of destruction.\n\nHolden Thorp, a former chancellor at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, said it doesn’t surprise him that someone “sharp” like Beilock would have made this hire, adding that public universities have long played this game at the state level, bringing in Republican operatives to work at a university to help navigate changing political leadership.\n\n“It makes perfect sense: every university is clearly going to have to work things out with the administration on a variety of matters — whether it’s funding or immigration matters with their students, or the Dear Colleague letter,” Thorp said. “All of this stuff is getting litigated in the courts, and then it’s playing out in Congress in terms of them writing the budget.”",

        "full_text": "BETA\n\nTHIS IS A BETA EXPERIENCE. OPT-OUT&nbspHERE\n\nTrump Signs Executive Order To ‘Eliminate’ Education Department—Here’s What That Means For Student Loans\n\nMar 20, 2025,05:32pm EDT\n\nTopline\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday which he said will “eliminate” the Department of Education, though the department will still keep some functions, including Title I and student loans, under federal control, as Trump expressed hope Congress would officially shutter the department.\n\nKey Facts\n\nTrump said his administration wants to shut down the Department of Education “as quickly as possible,” adding “we want to return our students to the states,” though it would ultimately take Congressional approval to formally close the department.\n\nThe order is designed to give states control over education, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier Thursday, though the federal government will still be responsible for administering Title I funding, Pell grants, student loans, special education funding and enforcement of civil rights laws, among other “critical functions.”\n\nTrump, for weeks, has been expected to sign an order to deconstruct the agency Republicans have long claimed is a product of bureaucratic bloat.\n\nThe White House claimed in a fact sheet on the forthcoming executive order “there has been virtually no measurable improvement in student achievement” since the Education Department was created in 1979, arguing it has failed to improve standardized test scores and proficiency in math and reading.\n\nThe order is only one step in dismantling the department, and firings at the agency have already prompted a lawsuit from Democratic state attorneys general.\n\nContra\n\nThe total elimination of the Education Department would require approval from Congress, which is controlled by Republicans. However, if a supermajority is needed in the Senate, at least seven Democrats would need to vote in favor of eliminating the department. Prior to signing the executive order, Trump said he hopes Democrats “will be voting for” the department’s elimination.\n\nKey Background\n\nTrump has long-promised to effectively shut down the agency, calling for it to be “closed immediately” last month and for Education Secretary Linda McMahon to “put herself out of a job.” His administration has already taken steps to slash the agency’s workforce, announcing earlier this month it would eliminate half of the 4,000 positions. The department was established by statute under President Jimmy Carter in 1979. Federal dollars now account for about 10% of public school funding.\n\nFurther Reading\n\n21 Democratic Attorneys General Sue Trump Administration Over Education Department Cuts (Forbes)\n\nTrump Plans To Sign Executive Order Today Dismantling Education Department (Forbes)\n\nJoin The Conversation\n\nOne Community.

        "full_text": "HELSINKI (AP) — Finland is the happiest country in the world for the eighth year in a row, according to the World Happiness Report 2025 published Thursday.\n\nOther Nordic countries are also once again at the top of the happiness rankings in the annual report published by the Wellbeing Research Centre at the University of Oxford. Besides Finland, Denmark, Iceland and Sweden remain the top four and in the same order.\n\nAino Virolainen, a digital commerce director, has lived abroad but always wants to return home to Finland.\n\n“This is where I always want to come back to and where I want to, you know, grow my kids and grow old myself,” Virolainen said Thursday. “And I think it’s because, you know, the peace and the quietness and the trustworthiness. You know, how we speak directly and the nature, of course. It’s clean and the air is fresh and what’s there not to love?”\n\nCountry rankings were based on answers people give when asked to rate their own lives. The study was done in partnership with the analytics firm Gallup and the U.N. Sustainable Development Solutions Network.\n\n“Happiness isn’t just about wealth or growth — it’s about trust, connection and knowing people have your back,” said Jon Clifton, the CEO of Gallup. “If we want stronger communities and economies, we must invest in what truly matters: each other.”\n\nSharing meals and having somebody to count on\n\nResearchers say that beyond health and wealth, some factors that influence happiness sound deceptively simple: sharing meals with others, having somebody to count on for social support, and household size. In Mexico and Europe, for example, a household size of four to five people predicts the highest levels of happiness, the study said.\n\nBelieving in the kindness of others is also much more closely tied to happiness than previously thought, according to the latest findings.\n\nAs an example, the report suggests that people who believe that others are willing to return their lost wallet is a strong predictor of the overall happiness of a population.\n\nNordic nations rank among the top places for expected and actual return of lost wallets, the study found.\n\nAlexandra Peth, a managing director, said Finnish culture prioritizes trust and connection.\n\n“People trust each other in Finland and I think on many levels in the society, we try to support each other,” Peth said. “So I think the system makes it kind of that you can trust it somehow.”\n\nOverall, researchers said that global evidence on the perceived and actual return of lost wallets shows that people are much too pessimistic about the kindness of their communities compared to reality — actual rates of wallet return are around twice as high as people expect.\n\nThe U.S. falls to its lowest-ever position in the happiness ranking\n\nWhile European countries dominate the top 20 in the ranking, there were some exceptions. Despite the war with Hamas, Israel came in at eighth. Costa Rica and Mexico entered the top 10 for the first time, ranking at sixth and 10th respectively.\n\nWhen it comes to decreasing happiness — or growing unhappiness — the United States has dropped to its lowest-ever position at 24, having previously peaked at 11th place in 2012. The report states that the number of people dining alone in the United States has increased 53% over the past two decades.\n\nThe United Kingdom, at position 23, is reporting its lowest average life evaluation since the 2017 report.\n\nAfghanistan is again ranked as the unhappiest country in the world, with Afghan women saying their lives are especially difficult.\n\nSierra Leone in western Africa is the second unhappiest, followed by Lebanon, ranking third from the bottom.\n\nAlmost one-fifth of young adults globally have no social support\n\nIn a concerning development, the study said that 19% of young adults across the world reported in 2023 that they have no one they could count on for social support. That is a 39% increase compared to 2006.\n\nAll countries are ranked according to their self-assessed life evaluations averaged over 2022 to 2024.\n\nExperts in economics, psychology, sociology and beyond then seek to explain the variations across countries and over time using factors such as gross domestic product per capita, healthy life expectancy, having someone to count on, a sense of freedom, generosity and perceptions of corruption.\n\nJouni Purhonen, a Helsinki resident, called Finns “really calm.”\n\n“So we have the time to think about things like live our life really peacefully and I guess easily, if you will,” Purhonen said.\n\n___\n\nKirsten Grieshaber reported from Berlin.",

        "full_text": "NEW YORK (AP) — 23andMe has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and its co-founder and CEO has resigned as the struggling genetic testing company continues its push to cut costs.\n\nSan Francisco-based 23andMe announced on Sunday that it will look to sell “substantially all of its assets” through a court-approved reorganization plan.\n\nAnne Wojcicki, who co-founded 23andMe nearly two decades ago, is also stepping down as CEO effective immediately, the company said — but will remain on the 23andMe board. Her resignation comes just weeks after a board committee rejected a nonbinding acquisition proposal from Wojcicki, who has been trying to take the company private.\n\nAnd Wojcicki intends to still bid on 23andMe as the company pursues a sale through the bankruptcy process. In a statement on social media, Wojcicki said that she resigned as CEO to be “in the best position” as an independent bidder.\n\n“There is no doubt that the challenges faced by 23andMe through an evolving business model have been real, but my belief in the company and its future is unwavering,” she later added.\n\n23andMe has faced an uncertain future for some time. Beyond battles to go private, the company struggled to find a profitable business model since going public in 2021. Privacy concerns related to customers’ genetic information have also emerged, notably spanning from a 2023 data breach — along with questions around what new ownership could mean for users’ data.\n\nHere’s what to know.\n\n23andMe’s bankruptcy follows months of turmoil\n\n23andMe was founded in 2006, with a promise to revolutionize the future of genetics and health care. The company became known for its saliva-based DNA testing kits — purchased by millions of customers eager to learn more about their ancestry — and later dived further into health research and drug development.\n\nBut recent years have been far from smooth sailing for 23andMe. And Sunday’s voluntary bankruptcy filing caps months of turmoil.\n\nLast September, all of its independent directors resigned in a rare move following acquisition negotiations with Wojcicki.\n\nThe company then announced in November that it would lay off 40% of its workforce, or more than 200 employees, and discontinue its therapeutics division. And in January, the board’s special committee said it was exploring strategic alternatives, including a possible sale.\n\nShares of 23andMe Holding Co. have shed nearly all their value since last spring — and plunged even farther after Sunday’s bankruptcy filing, trading at under $1 as of midday Monday.\n\nIn recent securities filings, 23andMe continued to warn about its “ability to continue as a going concern” — which is accounting-speak for having the resources needed to operate and stay in business.\n\nSunday’s Chapter 11 filing from 23andMe reported total debts of more than $214.7 million as of the end of last year. Assets, meanwhile, amounted to over $277.4 million.\n\nWhat does Chapter 11 mean for the company?\n\n23andMe says that filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection will help facilitate a sale of the company, meaning that it’s seeking new ownership.\n\nIn a statement Sunday, Board Chair Mark Jensen said that this court-supervised process was “the best path forward.” He added they also expect it to help 23andMe’s efforts to cut costs as well as resolve legal and leasehold liabilities.\n\n23andMe is looking to pull back from its real estate footprint. Among motions filed on Sunday, the company is seeking court approval to reject lease contracts in San Francisco and Sunnyvale, California, for example, in efforts to help cut down on expenses.\n\nOtherwise, 23andMe says it plans to continue operating. The company says it’s received $35 million in debtor-in-possession financing from JMB Capital Partners to help support its business throughout the bankruptcy process.\n\nI’m a 23andMe customer. Is my genetic data safe?\n\n23andMe says its bankruptcy filing won’t change the way it stores or protects data. Jensen, the board chair, said Sunday that 23andMe is “committed to continuing to safeguard customer data” and that data privacy will be “an important consideration” in any future sale.\n\nJohn Bringardner of Debtwire notes that any new buyer of 23andMe will have to comply with regulatory approvals that ensure “customer data won’t end up in unscrupulous hands.”\n\nStill, who will end up owning 23andMe down the road is unknown. And experts note that risks remain.\n\n“Personal data collected by 23andme has always been at risk,” Bringardner wrote in emailed commentary on Monday — pointing particularly to a 2023 data breach that compromised ancestral information for nearly 7 million 23andMe customers. He adds that litigation spanning from the aftermath of this breach helped drive up liabilities that eventually contributed to the current bankruptcy filing.\n\nLast year, 23andMe agreed to pay $30 million in cash to settle a class-action lawsuit accusing the company of failing to protect customers whose personal information was exposed in this breach. On Sunday, the company said that it plans to use bankruptcy proceedings to “resolve all outstanding legal liabilities” stemming from the October 2023 incident.\n\nBeyond this data breach, uncertainty about the company’s future overall has also led some to recently urge 23andMe customers to delete their data.\n\nOn Friday, days before 23andMe’s bankruptcy filing, California Attorney General Rob Bonta issued an urgent alert reminding 23andMe customers of their legal rights under state law — and called on them to consider deleting and destroying any genetic data held by the company. Bonta’s office pointed to 23andMe’s ongoing financial distress and “trove of sensitive consumer data” the company has amassed.\n\n______\n\nAP Health Writer Tom Murphy contributed to this report from Indianapolis."

        "full_text": "Across the United States, recent political protests have taken the form of violence against the car company Tesla – whose CEO Elon Musk is advising the Trump administration in its efforts to radically downsize the federal government.\n\nPeople have vandalized Tesla charging stations and dealerships, fired bullets into one Oregon showroom, and set cars ablaze this week at a Las Vegas Tesla collision center.\n\nThese property attacks are part of a broader increase in politically or ideologically motivated violence. Prominent examples, against a backdrop high overall gun violence in America, range from the killing of a health insurance executive to an attempted assassination of then-candidate Donald Trump. Then there was also the mowing down of pedestrians in New Orleans by a truck driven by a radicalized former American soldier.\n\nWhy We Wrote This\n\nWide-ranging homegrown threats of political and extremist violence are challenging law enforcement to change how it operates. Some experts say cooperation among agencies and community trust are essential to solving the problem.\n\nWhile relatively rare, the attacks defy easy categories. Extremist violence runs from organized groups to lone attackers and from right-wing or white supremacist ideologies to leftist confrontations with police and the recent Tesla vandalism.\n\nTo Brian Levin, founder of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, this means the threat can be characterized as “everything, everywhere, all at once.”\n\nIn fact, in the search for solutions, some public safety experts say it’s essential to remember that extreme violence is not always ideologically motivated. And the best responses to the varied threats often include general ones, such as community vigilance and better security for public events.\n\n“What it means in practical terms is that only shared solutions can work,” says John Horgan, the Violent Extremism Research Group director at Georgia State University in Atlanta. “While the FBI will be responsible for managing investigations, community leaders, teachers, and others all have their roles to play in not just educating people about the dangers of terrorism but in showing us what we can do to safeguard our communities against these threats.”\n\nA selective approach to justice?\n\nPresident Trump won office in part on promises of law and order. His focus is on curbing illegal immigration, and he has suggested treating the Tesla attacks as domestic terrorism.\n\nBut there are also signs of a selective approach to justice, including retribution against perceived enemies and laxity on some crimes. One of the president’s first acts after inauguration was to pardon his own supporters convicted of crimes in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nJason Riddle was a rare one who didn’t accept that pardon.\n\nOn the day of the attack, the New Hampshire man posed inside the Capitol, jubilantly holding up a stolen bottle of wine as he tried to stop the lawful certification of President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. Today, he says the pardons undermine the rule of law.\n\n“This moment feels scary and dangerous,” says Mr. Riddle, a former U.S. postal worker.\n\nThe apparent injection of partisanship into who will face legal accountability is troubling, says former FBI counterterrorism analyst Matthew Levitt, now an analyst at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy. It’s “why we’re in a situation right now where there’s concern about undermining ... norms of law enforcement and the rule of law.”\n\nThis comes as homegrown terrorism has been on the rise. Between 2013 and 2021, the number of domestic terrorism-related cases more than tripled, with three-fourths of the total 444 cases fueled by racial or cultural hatred, according to congressional testimony by extremism expert Cynthia Miller-Idriss. But starting this decade, deaths from hard-left attacks have begun rising. Islamist terrorism also remains a significant extremism threat in the U.S.\n\nFusing ideology and personal pain\n\nFor those who perpetrate political violence, their story can often be a blurry fusion of ideology and personal pain.\n\nLuigi Mangione, the 26-year-old charged with murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, struggled with chronic back pain, according to news reports. Whether that might have affected his alleged is unclear. What is certain is that Mr. Mangione had been deeply critical of the U.S. health insurance system – a view shared by many Americans, more than half of whom rate it as “fair” or “poor,” according to a recent Gallup pool.\n\nEarly on New Year’s Day, Shamsud-Din Jabbar used a truck to kill 14 pedestrians and injure 30 others out celebrating on Bourbon Street in New Orleans.\n\nMr. Jabbar, who died during the attack, carried an Islamic State (ISIS) flag in his truck and appeared to be self-radicalized. A Texas-born information technology specialist, former soldier, and real estate agent, he had also been through multiple divorces and financial challenges.\n\nThe search for shared solutions\n\nAmericans have begun to adapt to evolving threats by discussing radicalization and mobilization toward violence in new ways.\n\nTerrorism has traditionally been defined as an act of public violence fueled or influenced by some ideology. But today, counterterror experts increasingly use phrases like “extreme violence” or “targeted violence.” They emphasize how the path from ideation to violence can be similar, whether ideology is involved or not. Professor Horgan sees this as a helpful shift.\n\n“Just looking at discrete, distinct types of violence may obscure the fact that there are shared solutions open to us,” he says.\n\nIndeed, communities are addressing the uptick in vehicle ramming attacks by installing physical barriers when and where needed. Gina Ligon, director of the National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology, and Education Center at the University of Nebraska Omaha, says these can include “beautiful security” such as planters with trees that “can serve the purpose of bollards but also not make people feel like they’re living in a security state.”\n\nSpecial teams that assess how behavior can flag violence have also become common in regional and local governments. As part of his work at Georgia State, Professor Horgan holds regular counterterrorism sessions with police departments.\n\nPolice officers, he says, often try to understand what kinds of ideas drive terrorists. Instead, he focuses on “behavioral leakage,” or clues about violent intent frequently exhibited by lone actors. One key to success: Authorities must assure informants that they are protected from prosecution. Fear of negative police attention is a major reason many terror plots go unreported.\n\nMost people who commit political violence leave missed clues. “The notion that we don’t see terrorism coming is complete nonsense,” says Professor Horgan.\n\nOne of the most pernicious forms of homegrown mass violence is school shootings. While legal terms and codes often render them “mass shootings” instead of terrorist acts, which are traditionally considered violence intended to sway governments, there has been a growing push to have lethal school violence like mass shootings labeled “domestic terrorism.”\n\nLast year, 59 gun deaths occurred on U.S. school grounds, according to data from the group Everytown. So far this year, there have been 10 such deaths.\n\nMost often, such attacks involve school shooters who had at least one social media account, had posted disturbing content of guns and threatening messages online, and had at least one reported adverse childhood experience, including being bullied in person or online, according to the Journal of Pediatric Health Care.\n\nJust as schools are trying to identify and address the causes of school violence, how the FBI defines threats and focuses resources in the broader population will be a key to confronting increasingly complex homegrown dangers.\n\nFighting extremism at home\n\nPresident Trump expanded federal anti-extremism programs in 2019 after a resurgence of attacks linked to ISIS, which the U.S. government designates as a terrorist group. Two years later, President Biden ramped up additional anti-extremism efforts after the Jan. 6 Capitol riots. Those efforts have included counterterrorism task forces and programs that engage school principals and social workers to help pinpoint and address potential threats.\n\nMr. Riddle, who served three months in prison for his role in the Jan. 6 riots, credits the state of New Hampshire for helping him. After an arrest for impaired driving, he says in an interview, the court ordered a breath alcohol meter installed on his car’s ignition.\n\nThanks to that requirement, he says, he achieved enough mental clarity to recognize that his fervor leading up to Jan. 6 was misguided. He is now concerned that some pardoned rioters still hold the view, endorsed and promoted by Mr. Trump, that the 2020 election was stolen. No court cases attempting to prove that allegation have succeeded.\n\nJonathan Lewis, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, says that while the motivations may be blurry and diverse – including global ideologies of terrorism – the most numerous risks of violence against the public area are homegrown.\n\n“Right now, with the domestic threat, there’s an unwillingness to reckon with the fact that the call is coming from inside the house,” he says."

        "full_text": "MADISON, Wis. — President Donald Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk are going all-in on flipping control of Wisconsin’s top court, with Trump endorsing the conservative in the race and Musk’s PAC hunting for votes by offering state residents cash for their contact details.\n\nThe burst of support comes as Trump faces his first test with swing-state voters in the April 1 election since winning a second term in November. The court is expected to decide the future of abortion in the state and could redraw a congressional map that has given Republicans six of the state’s eight seats.\n\nTrump on Friday said on his Truth Social platform that he was backing Brad Schimel, a Waukesha County judge and former Republican state attorney general who is seeking a seat on Wisconsin’s high court. He excoriated the liberal in the race, Dane County Judge Susan Crawford, writing “if she wins, the Movement to restore our Nation will bypass Wisconsin.”\n\nGroups affiliated with Musk have poured more than $13 million into Wisconsin in recent weeks in what is already the most expensive court race in U.S. history. Musk, ranked by Forbes as the world’s richest person, has put a spotlight on the race as he assists Trump with firing government workers and shuttering federal agencies through his U.S. DOGE Service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk dialed up his focus on Wisconsin on Thursday when his America PAC offered registered voters in the state $100 if they provided contact information and signed a petition opposing activist judges. The PAC also offered them $100 for each registered Wisconsin voter they referred to sign the petition — but the fine print of the offer said the PAC would determine whom to pay and noted payments may not be made for months.\n\nThe payment-for-data arrangement will give Musk’s team an easy way to reach a pool of voters it can bombard with messages urging them to support Schimel in the election. Turnout in Wisconsin court elections is much lower than in presidential elections, and liberals have had a large turnout advantage in recent court races. Political observers for both sides say Schimel’s best chance of success is to get voters who backed Trump in November to the polls.\n\nOn Saturday, Musk hosted Schimel on an audio live stream on X, the social media site owned by Musk. “If you look at the early voting data so far, Democrats are winning, which is not good,” Musk said.\n\nCrawford’s campaign called Trump and Musk’s support unsurprising and contended Schimel would do their bidding. Crawford and her allies for weeks have decried Musk’s role in the race, with the state Democratic Party holding town-hall-style meetings about the race dubbed “The People v. Musk.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Schimel has spent his entire career on bent knee to right-wing special interests,” Crawford spokesman Derrick Honeyman said in a statement. “We assumed he had this endorsement locked up months ago.”\n\nCandidates and independent groups have spent $76 million on the race so far, according to a tally by news site Wispolitics.com. That beats the national record for a court race set two years ago, when liberals gained control of Wisconsin’s top court.\n\nOn the audio live stream, Musk said he got involved in the race because the court’s liberal 4-3 majority may eventually redraw the state’s congressional districts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It could cause the House to switch to Democrat if that redrawing takes place, and then we wouldn’t be able to get through the changes that the American people want,” Musk said.\n\nThere is no pending lawsuit over Wisconsin’s congressional districts, but liberal groups may file one if the court keeps its ideological makeup. Two years ago, liberal voters filed a lawsuit over state legislative districts after the liberals won a majority of the court, and the justices soon struck down maps that had given Republicans large majorities in the state legislature. Under new maps, Democrats made large gains last year.\n\nCrawford met by video in January with a liberal group that billed the race as a chance to redraw the state’s House districts. Crawford has said she didn’t discuss redistricting during the call, but Schimel and Republicans have said the meeting shows what’s at stake if she wins.\n\nMusk and Schimel’s audio live stream included some technical glitches and featured Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin), who contended the court’s liberals could reverse the state’s voter ID law and its restrictions on collective bargaining for most public workers in the state.\n\nThe group did not discuss the two biggest cases on the court’s docket, which together will determine whether abortion will remain legal in the state. The cases are expected to be decided before August when a new justice is sworn in, but they will shape what kind of future abortion litigation could come to the high court. Crawford supports abortion rights; Schimel has long opposed abortion but during the campaign has said he would respect the will of voters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWisconsin clinics stopped offering abortions in 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and ended that ruling’s guarantee of access to abortion. They feared an 1849 state law would prevent them from providing abortions, but they resumed offering them in 2023 after a lower court ruled the law did not apply to them.\n\nThe state Supreme Court is now considering that case along with one that asks whether the state constitution guarantees a right to abortion. Abortion is now allowed for up to 20 weeks in the state.\n\nSchimel, Musk and Johnson also did not mention that Musk’s electric car company, Tesla, sued the state in January after Wisconsin officials barred it from opening dealerships because of a state law that bars car manufacturers from owning dealerships. That case could eventually make it to the state Supreme Court.\n\nMusk called the race important but made light of its timing.\n\n“Such a fateful election,” he said, “but it’s on April Fools’ Day.”"

        "full_text": "Advocacy and labor groups on Monday filed a lawsuit to stop President Trump’s executive order to dismantle the Department of Education, saying the move is unconstitutional and will hurt students.\n\nThe National Education Association; the NAACP; the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Maryland Council 3; and a group of public school parents are asking a federal judge to “immediately halt” the administration’s attempt to shutter the department, they said in a statement.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Mr. Trump overstepped his constitutional authority and violated the Administrative Procedure Act, asserting that the Education Department was created by Congress and cannot be dismantled by a president.\n\n“Taken together, defendants’ steps since January 20, 2025, constitute a de facto dismantling of the Department by executive fiat …” the complaint states. “But the Constitution gives power over ‘the establishment of offices [and] the determination of functions and jurisdiction’ to Congress — not the President or any officer working under him.’ Because it is a Congressionally-created federal agency, legally eliminating the Department of Education, or its constituent offices, or transferring them to other federal agencies requires Congressional approval.”\n\nMr. Trump does not have the authority to close a Cabinet-level department. That would require a 60-vote majority in the Senate, which he is unlikely to achieve given the GOP’s slim control of the upper chamber. Much of the Education Department’s primary responsibilities, such as administering student loans and providing grants to students with disabilities, have been codified by Congress.\n\n“The NEA and NAACP have done nothing to advance the educational outcomes of America’s students and the latest NAEP scores prove that. Instead of playing politics with baseless lawsuits, these groups should ditch the courtroom and work with the Trump administration and states on improving the classroom,” White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement.\n\nSEE ALSO: Federal judge rules DOGE broke privacy rules in accessing Education Department files\n\nThe lawsuit comes days after Mr. Trump signed an executive order directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to take all steps within her authority to slash the agency’s workforce and limit its scope.\n\nMr. Trump said he would shift the Education Department’s student loan program to the Small Business Administration and programs for students with disabilities and nutrition programs to the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nEarlier this month, the department announced it had laid off more than 1,300 employees, which prompted a lawsuit from 21 Democratic state attorneys general who say the firings impede the agency’s ability to carry out its main responsibilities.\n\nDismantling the department has long been a goal for Republicans since it was created by President Jimmy Carter in 1979. President Ronald Reagan had tried to cut it after taking office but was unsuccessful. Conservative ire for the department reached new heights under President Joseph R. Biden after it began forgiving student loans, bungled the rollout of new financial aid forms and expanded rules to accommodate transgender students in sports."

        "full_text": "President Donald Trump said Monday that the U.S. will impose 25% tariffs on countries that buy oil and gas from Venezuela, as he seeks to increase pressure on President Nicolas Maduro and China.\n\nCountries that buy oil and gas from Venezuela will face tariffs on any trade they have with the U.S., Trump said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social. The tariffs take effect on April 2, the president said.\n\n\"If they buy their oil from Venezuela, they have to pay a 25% tariff to do business with the United States —that's on top of existing tariffs,\" Trump said during a press conference at the White House.\n\nVenezuela exported about 660,000 barrels per day in 2024, according to data from Kpler. China was the largest destination for the South American nation's crude exports, purchasing 270,000 bpd last year.\n\n\"This announcement by the Trump administration appears to be one more action targeting China,\" Matt Smith, an oil analyst at Kpler, told CNBC.\n\nBrent crude futures rose 61 cents, or 0.85%, to $72.77 a barrel by 1:15 p.m. ET. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was up 59 cents, or 0.86%, at $68.87.\n\n\"We expect oil prices to go higher in light of this news and may rise further if Trump follows through with this proclamation,\" analyst Leo Mariani at Roth told clients in a note.\n\nThe Treasury Department on Monday also extended Chevron's license to produce oil in Venezuela until May 27. Trump said in late February that he would reverse a Biden administration decision which allowed Chevron to restart oil production in the country. Treasury had previously given the oil major until April 3 to wind down its operations in Venezuela.\n\nChevron CEO Mike Wirth lobbied Trump administration officials to extend the license during meetings last week, people familiar with the discussions told The Wall Street Journal. Chevron does business in Venezuela through a partnership with its national oil company Petróleos de Venezuela. The oil major has stakes in five onshore and offshore projects in western and eastern Venezuela.\n\nThe tariffs are intended to make it more difficult for China to gain a foothold in Venezuela's oil industry while bolstering Chevron and ensuring oil flows to the U.S., people familiar with the matter told the Journal last week.\n\nTrump invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act on March 15 in response to what the president claims is an invasion by Tren de Aragua. The president said its members are conducting \"irregular warfare\" against the U.S. at the direction of Maduro.\n\nFederal District Court Judge James Boasberg has blocked Trump's plan to deport alleged members of Tren de Aragua using the Alien Enemies Act. Trump has called for Boasberg's impeachment, sparking fears among some legal experts that the U.S. is facing a constitutional crisis. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts has rebuked Trump's calls for Boasberg to be removed.\n\nGet Your Ticket to Pro LIVE\n\nJoin us at the New York Stock Exchange!\n\nUncertain markets?

        "full_text": "I, however, knew two hours before the first bombs exploded that the attack might be coming. The reason I knew this is that Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, had texted me the war plan at 11:44 a.m. The plan included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing.\n\nThis is going to require some explaining.\n\nThis article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.\n\nThe story technically begins shortly after the Hamas invasion of southern Israel, in October 2023. The Houthis—an Iran-backed terrorist organization whose motto is “God is great, death to America, death to Israel, curse on the Jews, victory to Islam”—soon launched attacks on Israel and on international shipping, creating havoc for global trade. Throughout 2024, the Biden administration was ineffective in countering these Houthi attacks; the incoming Trump administration promised a tougher response.\n\nThis is where Pete Hegseth and I come in.\n\nOn Tuesday, March 11, I received a connection request on Signal from a user identified as Michael Waltz. Signal is an open-source encrypted messaging service popular with journalists and others who seek more privacy than other text-messaging services are capable of delivering. I assumed that the Michael Waltz in question was President Donald Trump’s national security adviser. I did not assume, however, that the request was from the actual Michael Waltz. I have met him in the past, and though I didn’t find it particularly strange that he might be reaching out to me, I did think it somewhat unusual, given the Trump administration’s contentious relationship with journalists—and Trump’s periodic fixation on me specifically. It immediately crossed my mind that someone could be masquerading as Waltz in order to somehow entrap me. It is not at all uncommon these days for nefarious actors to try to induce journalists to share information that could be used against them.\n\nI accepted the connection request, hoping that this was the actual national security adviser, and that he wanted to chat about Ukraine, or Iran, or some other important matter.\n\nTwo days later—Thursday—at 4:28 p.m., I received a notice that I was to be included in a Signal chat group. It was called the “Houthi PC small group.”\n\nA message to the group, from “Michael Waltz,” read as follows: “Team – establishing a principles [sic] group for coordination on Houthis, particularly for over the next 72 hours. My deputy Alex Wong is pulling together a tiger team at deputies/agency Chief of Staff level following up from the meeting in the Sit Room this morning for action items and will be sending that out later this evening.”\n\nThe message continued, “Pls provide the best staff POC from your team for us to coordinate with over the next couple days and over the weekend. Thx.”\n\nThe term principals committee generally refers to a group of the senior-most national-security officials, including the secretaries of defense, state, and the treasury, as well as the director of the CIA. It should go without saying—but I’ll say it anyway—that I have never been invited to a White House principals-committee meeting, and that, in my many years of reporting on national-security matters, I had never heard of one being convened over a commercial messaging app.\n\nOne minute later, a person identified only as “MAR”—the secretary of state is Marco Antonio Rubio—wrote, “Mike Needham for State,” apparently designating the current counselor of the State Department as his representative. At that same moment, a Signal user identified as “JD Vance” wrote, “Andy baker for VP.” One minute after that, “TG” (presumably Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, or someone masquerading as her) wrote, “Joe Kent for DNI.” Nine minutes later, “Scott B”—apparently Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, or someone spoofing his identity, wrote, “Dan Katz for Treasury.” At 4:53 p.m., a user called “Pete Hegseth” wrote, “Dan Caldwell for DoD.” And at 6:34 p.m., “Brian” wrote “Brian McCormack for NSC.” One more person responded: “John Ratcliffe” wrote at 5:24 p.m. with the name of a CIA official to be included in the group. I am not publishing that name, because that person is an active intelligence officer.\n\nThe principals had apparently assembled. In all, 18 individuals were listed as members of this group, including various National Security Council officials; Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s Middle East and Ukraine negotiator; Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff; and someone identified only as “S M,” which I took to stand for Stephen Miller. I appeared on my own screen only as “JG.”\n\nThat was the end of the Thursday text chain.\n\nAfter receiving the Waltz text related to the “Houthi PC small group,” I consulted a number of colleagues. We discussed the possibility that these texts were part of a disinformation campaign, initiated by either a foreign intelligence service or, more likely, a media-gadfly organization, the sort of group that attempts to place journalists in embarrassing positions, and sometimes succeeds. I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans. I also could not believe that the national security adviser to the president would be so reckless as to include the editor in chief of The Atlantic in such discussions with senior U.S. officials, up to and including the vice president.\n\nThe next day, things got even stranger.\n\nAt 8:05 a.m. on Friday, March 14, “Michael Waltz” texted the group: “Team, you should have a statement of conclusions with taskings per the Presidents guidance this morning in your high side inboxes.” (High side, in government parlance, refers to classified computer and communications systems.) “State and DOD, we developed suggested notification lists for regional Allies and partners. Joint Staff is sending this am a more specific sequence of events in the coming days and we will work w DOD to ensure COS, OVP and POTUS are briefed.”\n\nAt this point, a fascinating policy discussion commenced. The account labeled “JD Vance” responded at 8:16: “Team, I am out for the day doing an economic event in Michigan. But I think we are making a mistake.” (Vance was indeed in Michigan that day.) The Vance account goes on to state, “3 percent of US trade runs through the suez. 40 percent of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn’t understand this or why it’s necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message.”\n\nThe Vance account then goes on to make a noteworthy statement, considering that the vice president has not deviated publicly from Trump’s position on virtually any issue. “I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”\n\nA person identified in Signal as “Joe Kent” (Trump’s nominee to run the National Counterterrorism Center is named Joe Kent) wrote at 8:22, “There is nothing time sensitive driving the time line. We’ll have the exact same options in a month.”\n\nThen, at 8:26 a.m., a message landed in my Signal app from the user “John Ratcliffe.” The message contained information that might be interpreted as related to actual and current intelligence operations.\n\nAt 8:27, a message arrived from the “Pete Hegseth” account. “VP: I understand your concerns – and fully support you raising w/ POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc). I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what – nobody knows who the Houthis are – which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.”\n\nThe Hegseth message goes on to state, “Waiting a few weeks or a month does not fundamentally change the calculus. 2 immediate risks on waiting: 1) this leaks, and we look indecisive; 2) Israel takes an action first – or Gaza cease fire falls apart – and we don’t get to start this on our own terms. We can manage both. We are prepared to execute, and if I had final go or no go vote, I believe we should. This [is] not about the Houthis. I see it as two things: 1) Restoring Freedom of Navigation, a core national interest; and 2) Reestablish deterrence, which Biden cratered. But, we can easily pause. And if we do, I will do all we can to enforce 100% OPSEC”—operations security. “I welcome other thoughts.”\n\nA few minutes later, the “Michael Waltz” account posted a lengthy note about trade figures, and the limited capabilities of European navies. “Whether it’s now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes. Per the president’s request we are working with DOD and State to determine how to compile the cost associated and levy them on the Europeans.”\n\nThe account identified as “JD Vance” addressed a message at 8:45 to @Pete Hegseth: “if you think we should do it let’s go. I just hate bailing Europe out again.” (The administration has argued that America’s European allies benefit economically from the U.S. Navy’s protection of international shipping lanes.)\n\nThe user identified as Hegseth responded three minutes later: “VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC. But Mike is correct, we are the only ones on the planet (on our side of the ledger) who can do this. Nobody else even close. Question is timing. I feel like now is as good a time as any, given POTUS directive to reopen shipping lanes. I think we should go; but POTUS still retains 24 hours of decision space.”\n\nAt this point, the previously silent “S M” joined the conversation. “As I heard it, the president was clear: green light, but we soon make clear to Egypt and Europe what we expect in return. We also need to figure out how to enforce such a requirement. EG, if Europe doesn’t remunerate, then what? If the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return.”\n\nThat message from “S M”—presumably President Trump’s confidant Stephen Miller, the deputy White House chief of staff, or someone playing Stephen Miller—effectively shut down the conversation. The last text of the day came from “Pete Hegseth,” who wrote at 9:46 a.m., “Agree.”\n\nAfter reading this chain, I recognized that this conversation possessed a high degree of verisimilitude. The texts, in their word choice and arguments, sounded as if they were written by the people who purportedly sent them, or by a particularly adept AI text generator. I was still concerned that this could be a disinformation operation, or a simulation of some sort. And I remained mystified that no one in the group seemed to have noticed my presence. But if it was a hoax, the quality of mimicry and the level of foreign-policy insight were impressive.\n\nIt was the next morning, Saturday, March 15, when this story became truly bizarre.\n\nAt 11:44 a.m., the account labeled “Pete Hegseth” posted in Signal a “TEAM UPDATE.” I will not quote from this update, or from certain other subsequent texts. The information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command’s area of responsibility. What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing.\n\nThe only person to reply to the update from Hegseth was the person identified as the vice president. “I will say a prayer for victory,” Vance wrote. (Two other users subsequently added prayer emoji.)\n\nAccording to the lengthy Hegseth text, the first detonations in Yemen would be felt two hours hence, at 1:45 p.m. eastern time. So I waited in my car in a supermarket parking lot. If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned, Houthi targets would soon be bombed. At about 1:55, I checked X and searched Yemen. Explosions were then being heard across Sanaa, the capital city.\n\nI went back to the Signal channel. At 1:48, “Michael Waltz” had provided the group an update. Again, I won’t quote from this text, except to note that he described the operation as an “amazing job.” A few minutes later, “John Ratcliffe” wrote, “A good start.” Not long after, Waltz responded with three emoji: a fist, an American flag, and fire. Others soon joined in, including “MAR,” who wrote, “Good Job Pete and your team!!,” and “Susie Wiles,” who texted, “Kudos to all – most particularly those in theater and CENTCOM! Really great. God bless.” “Steve Witkoff” responded with five emoji: two hands-praying, a flexed bicep, and two American flags. “TG” responded, “Great work and effects!” The after-action discussion included assessments of damage done, including the likely death of a specific individual. The Houthi-run Yemeni health ministry reported that at least 53 people were killed in the strikes, a number that has not been independently verified.\n\nOn Sunday, Waltz appeared on ABC’s This Week and contrasted the strikes with the Biden administration’s more hesitant approach. “These were not kind of pinprick, back-and-forth—what ultimately proved to be feckless attacks,” he said. “This was an overwhelming response that actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out.”\n\nThe Signal chat group, I concluded, was almost certainly real. Having come to this realization, one that seemed nearly impossible only hours before, I removed myself from the Signal group, understanding that this would trigger an automatic notification to the group’s creator, “Michael Waltz,” that I had left. No one in the chat had seemed to notice that I was there. And I received no subsequent questions about why I left—or, more to the point, who I was.\n\nEarlier today, I emailed Waltz and sent him a message on his Signal account. I also wrote to Pete Hegseth, John Ratcliffe, Tulsi Gabbard, and other officials. In an email, I outlined some of my questions: Is the “Houthi PC small group” a genuine Signal thread? Did they know that I was included in this group? Was I (on the off chance) included on purpose? If not, who did they think I was? Did anyone realize who I was when I was added, or when I removed myself from the group? Do senior Trump-administration officials use Signal regularly for sensitive discussions? Do the officials believe that the use of such a channel could endanger American personnel?\n\nBrian Hughes, the spokesman for the National Security Council, responded two hours later, confirming the veracity of the Signal group. “This appears to be an authentic message chain, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,” Hughes wrote. “The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to troops or national security.”\n\nWilliam Martin, a spokesperson for Vance, said that despite the impression created by the texts, the vice president is fully aligned with the president. “The Vice President’s first priority is always making sure that the President’s advisers are adequately briefing him on the substance of their internal deliberations,” he said. “Vice President Vance unequivocally supports this administration’s foreign policy. The President and the Vice President have had subsequent conversations about this matter and are in complete agreement.”\n\nI have never seen a breach quite like this. It is not uncommon for national-security officials to communicate on Signal. But the app is used primarily for meeting planning and other logistical matters—not for detailed and highly confidential discussions of a pending military action. And, of course, I’ve never heard of an instance in which a journalist has been invited to such a discussion.\n\nConceivably, Waltz, by coordinating a national-security-related action over Signal, may have violated several provisions of the Espionage Act, which governs the handling of “national defense” information, according to several national-security lawyers interviewed by my colleague Shane Harris for this story. Harris asked them to consider a hypothetical scenario in which a senior U.S. official creates a Signal thread for the express purpose of sharing information with Cabinet officials about an active military operation. He did not show them the actual Signal messages or tell them specifically what had occurred.\n\nAll of these lawyers said that a U.S. official should not establish a Signal thread in the first place. Information about an active operation would presumably fit the law’s definition of “national defense” information. The Signal app is not approved by the government for sharing classified information. The government has its own systems for that purpose. If officials want to discuss military activity, they should go into a specially designed space known as a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF—most Cabinet-level national-security officials have one installed in their home—or communicate only on approved government equipment, the lawyers said. Normally, cellphones are not permitted inside a SCIF, which suggests that as these officials were sharing information about an active military operation, they could have been moving around in public. Had they lost their phones, or had they been stolen, the potential risk to national security would have been severe.\n\nHegseth, Ratcliffe, and other Cabinet-level officials presumably would have the authority to declassify information, and several of the national-security lawyers noted that the hypothetical officials on the Signal chain might claim that they had declassified the information they shared. But this argument rings hollow, they cautioned, because Signal is not an authorized venue for sharing information of such a sensitive nature, regardless of whether it has been stamped “top secret” or not.\n\nThere was another potential problem: Waltz set some of the messages in the Signal group to disappear after one week, and some after four. That raises questions about whether the officials may have violated federal records law: Text messages about official acts are considered records that should be preserved.\n\n“Under the records laws applicable to the White House and federal agencies, all government employees are prohibited from using electronic-messaging applications such as Signal for official business, unless those messages are promptly forwarded or copied to an official government account,” Jason R. Baron, a professor at the University of Maryland and the former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration, told Harris.\n\n“Intentional violations of these requirements are a basis for disciplinary action. Additionally, agencies such as the Department of Defense restrict electronic messaging containing classified information to classified government networks and/or networks with government-approved encrypted features,” Baron said.\n\nSeveral former U.S. officials told Harris and me that they had used Signal to share unclassified information and to discuss routine matters, particularly when traveling overseas without access to U.S. government systems. But they knew never to share classified or sensitive information on the app, because their phones could have been hacked by a foreign intelligence service, which would have been able to read the messages on the devices. It is worth noting that Donald Trump, as a candidate for president (and as president), repeatedly and vociferously demanded that Hillary Clinton be imprisoned for using a private email server for official business when she was secretary of state. (It is also worth noting that Trump was indicted in 2023 for mishandling classified documents, but the charges were dropped after his election.)\n\nWaltz and the other Cabinet-level officials were already potentially violating government policy and the law simply by texting one another about the operation. But when Waltz added a journalist—presumably by mistake—to his principals committee, he created new security and legal issues. Now the group was transmitting information to someone not authorized to receive it. That is the classic definition of a leak, even if it was unintentional, and even if the recipient of the leak did not actually believe it was a leak until Yemen came under American attack.\n\nAll along, members of the Signal group were aware of the need for secrecy and operations security. In his text detailing aspects of the forthcoming attack on Houthi targets, Hegseth wrote to the group—which, at the time, included me—“We are currently clean on OPSEC.”\n\nShane Harris contributed reporting."

Join Today! to listen to this post.\n\nHappy Monday! The second round of voting in our inaugural Dispawtch bracket is live, and not a single cat advanced to the Sweet 16. Get your votes in by 8 p.m. ET on Wednesday to have a say in which canines make it to the Elite Eight.\n\nEditor’s Note: Penny seems totally unfazed by her early exit from the tournament and sends her congratulations to Adelaide on a well-earned victory, but Penny’s humans are a little distraught.\n\nQuick Hits: Today’s Top Stories\n\nIsraeli warplanes struck Hamas targets across the Gaza Strip overnight Saturday, killing Salah al-Bardawil, a senior member of the terrorist group’s political bureau. The ongoing aerial attacks came as Israeli troops expanded ground operations aimed at destroying Hamas infrastructure and creating a buffer zone along the Israel-Gaza border. Meanwhile, six rockets were fired at northern Israel from Lebanon on Saturday morning—the first such attack since December. Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed terrorist organization, denied responsibility for the rocket fire, which threatened to upend a November ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon. Hours later, Israel carried out airstrikes on dozens of Hezbollah command centers and rocket launchers.\n\nSudan’s army seized the country’s presidential palace on Friday, delivering the Sudanese Armed Forces an important political and military victory as it seeks to reclaim the entirety of Khartoum from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. The capital city has been at the center of fighting since the start of the war—which has left more than 28,000 people dead nationwide and displaced 11 million others—in April 2023. In January, the State Department determined that both sides of the conflict had committed war crimes.\n\nThe Trump administration plans to revoke temporary legal status for more than 530,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, according to a Federal Register notice published Friday. The move, which follows President Donald Trump’s January executive order directing the Department of Homeland Security to “terminate all categorical parole programs that are contrary to the policies of the United States,” will end the Biden administration’s two-year parole program for immigrants who arrived by air and had American sponsors. The administration urged the immigrants to leave the country before the change takes effect on April 24.\n\nColumbia University on Friday agreed to the many demands made by the Trump administration after the White House withheld $400 million in federal grants and contracts, alleging that the university created a climate of antisemitism on campus. In a memo, the university’s interim president, Dr. Katrina Armstrong, said that Columbia would hire a team of campus police officers with the power to arrest students, establish a committee dedicated to promoting free speech and academic freedom on campus, revise antidiscrimination policies and disciplinary processes, and require demonstrators to present Columbia ID when asked, among a slew of other policies.\n\nThe Trump administration on Friday selected Boeing to lead the development of the F-47 fighter, the Air Force’s next-generation air superiority and drone coordination jet, a major coup for the embattled aerospace company. Named after Trump, the 47th president, the fighter is expected to fight alongside autonomous aircraft made by Anduril Industries and General Atomics. The new projects are part of the Next Generation Air Dominance effort, meant to succeed Lockheed Martin’s F-22 Raptor, which had been paused earlier this year due to cost concerns.\n\nMore than 100 staffers in the Department of Homeland Security’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties were put on leave Friday, as the DHS announced plans to cut the office, along with the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman. Both offices are responsible for ensuring that the DHS complies with equal protection and civil rights laws. “These reductions ensure taxpayer dollars support the Department’s core mission: border security and immigration enforcement,” a DHS spokesperson said.\n\nPope Francis was discharged from the Gemelli hospital in Rome on Sunday, the end of a stay that began on February 14 when he entered the hospital with double pneumonia. One of his physicians, Dr. Sergio Alfieri, told reporters that the pontiff experienced multiple life-threatening episodes while in the hospital, but has recovered from his pneumonia and will require at least two months of rest. He is expected to return to his duties as soon as possible, and gave a public blessing while leaving the hospital.\n\nTurkey’s ‘Navalny Moment’?\n\nHundreds of thousands of protesters gathered in cities across Turkey on Sunday night, with many calling for an end to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s rule after more than two decades in power. The mass demonstrations, now approaching their sixth day, followed the arrest last week of the longtime Turkish leader’s chief political rival: Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu.\n\nEarlier in the day, some 15 million people supported İmamoğlu—the only candidate on the ballot—in the presidential primary of Turkey’s main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP). The party opened voting to non-CHP members, garnering a large turnout in a show of national solidarity with the embattled politician. Meanwhile on Sunday, Turkish authorities jailed İmamoğlu pending a trial and stripped him of his mayorship. The move—widely viewed as an attempt to preemptively bar the popular opposition leader from running in the country’s presidential election, which must be held by May 2028—marked Turkey’s latest and most dire departure from its democratic tradition.\n\n“As a defender of democracy and believer in the power of the people, I trust that the truth will prevail,” İmamoğlu said during his first appearance in court on Saturday. “I feel the strength of millions behind me and cannot even put into words the courage it gives me.”\n\nNationwide protests began on Wednesday, hours after police first arrested İmamoğlu in his Istanbul home on charges of “establishing and managing a criminal organization, taking bribes, extortion, unlawfully recording personal data and rigging a tender.” A day earlier, Istanbul University had revoked his degree under apparent pressure from Ankara, threatening his presidential bid as, under the Turkish constitution, presidential candidates must have completed higher education. The ousted mayor has also faced accusations of aiding a terrorist group—charges he categorically denies.\n\nİmamoğlu rose to national prominence in 2019 after defeating Erdoğan’s handpicked candidate for mayor of Istanbul. Ever since, he’s faced dubious prosecution and threats of being banned from holding public office, including for “insulting” election officials who voided his victory in the local election, thereby forcing another race that İmamoğlu won by an even larger margin. But he continues to garner nationwide support, earning the reputation—even outside of the CHP—of being an impressive orator and capable potential challenger to Erdoğan when the time comes for elections.\n\n“He’s got that sort of X factor, in terms of both rhetoric and presence,” Sinan Ciddi, a non-resident senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies who focuses on Turkish politics, told TMD. “But also, just being mayor of Istanbul really elevates you to a national status.” Erdoğan himself held the coveted office from 1994 to 1998.\n\nThe demonstrators now taking to the streets calling for İmamoğlu’s release are a mixed bag. While some simply want the government to drop the charges against İmamoğlu to let the democratic process play out, others are demanding Erdoğan’s ouster after more than two decades in power. While many are longtime CHP supporters, most are young people who see a broader assault on their rights unfolding.\n\n“Erdoğan has been in power for more than 20 years, as prime minister and now as president,” Utku Barut, a master’s student who attended a Sunday protest outside of Istanbul’s city hall, told TMD. “Young people who are voting right now were born in Erdoğan’s regime. … They’ve only seen one political party ruling the country.”\n\nIn Istanbul and other cities across the country, Turkish authorities sought to squash the protests before they ever began, blockading roads and shutting down metro stations. They also restricted access to various social media and messaging platforms, according to the NetBlocks tracker, forcing users to access the internet via a virtual private network. Several X accounts belonging to opposition organizers were also suspended, sparking accusations that the platform had booted the activists at the request of the Turkish government.\n\nPolice used water cannons, pepper spray, and tear gas at the demonstrations in an effort to disburse the crowds, and some attendees even reported being shot with rubber bullets. Hundreds have been detained. Meanwhile, the government has largely suppressed coverage of the unrest, using its nearly unfettered control over Turkish media to prevent the protests from being broadcast live.\n\nFor many people in Turkey, the events of the last week seem to mark a turning point. In recent years, elections have typically been regarded as free but not fair: The process itself is democratic, but Erdoğan, as Turkey’s sole executive, can marshall the resources of the state to influence the outcome. By seeking to prevent the opposition from choosing its own nominee, the president has plunged the country into new, uncharted territory.\n\n“This is the first time I know of that Turkey’s government has said, ‘I get to choose who runs against me, not the people,’” Ciddi said. “It’s very difficult to describe Turkey now, even under the most simple definition, as a democracy.”\n\n“There’s increasing worry that this is a Navalny moment,” he added, referring to Alexei Navalny, the Russian opposition leader whose 2021 arrest led to mass protests and who later died in an Arctic penal colony.\n\nAnd as the relatively muted response from the international community thus far has demonstrated, civil disobedience may be the only force holding the Turkish president to account. Erdoğan and U.S. President Donald Trump have long had good personal chemistry, with the Turkish leader welcoming the return of his “friend” to Washington after the November election. Trump is reportedly considering selling Turkey F-35 fighter jets, reversing its exclusion from the program in July 2019 over its acquisition of the Russian-made S-400 air defense system. Erdoğan is also eyeing a White House visit next month.\n\nResponding to a question about İmamoğlu’s arrest during a Wednesday press briefing, State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce encouraged Turkey to “respect human rights” but added: “We’re not going to comment on … the internal decision-making of another country … except to remind them that we expect them to behave in a manner that respects the rights of all of its citizens.”\n\nEuropean countries, meanwhile, are looking to Ankara—a prospective European Union member—as a partner in their efforts to bolster the continent’s collective defense. Turkey has the second-largest army in NATO, behind only the United States.\n\n“It’s a NATO member, an aspiring European Union member, and a treaty ally of the United States, so we should be worried,” Ciddi said. “Turkey is headed toward a very, very dark place.”\n\nToday’s Must-Read\n\nA New Exodus\n\nOnly about 10 percent of American Jews are Orthodox, generally defined by adherence to traditional Jewish law, such as Sabbath and kosher observance. Fewer still are Orthodox and interested in receiving a secular higher education. These Modern Orthodox—distinguished by traditional observance combined with full participation in American life—have long maintained a disproportionate presence at elite universities relative to their population size. … Yet these students feel the weight of recent campus controversies most acutely, as they are both “visibly” Jewish—often identifiable by their dress—and near-unanimously ardent Zionists.\n\nToeing the Company Line\n\nPolitics March 21, 2025\n\nBad Faith\n\nHow much judicial deference is owed to an untrustworthy president?\n\nEconomics March 21, 2025\n\nThe Energy That Fuels the American Dream\n\nPeople need mobility—and freedom—to pursue happiness.\n\nSociety & Culture March 22, 2025\n\nThe Hurt We Carry\n\nThe hit show ‘Severance’ shows the limits of dissociation.\n\nSociety & Culture March 22, 2025\n\nA Century of Flannery O’Connor\n\nThe Southern writer has a depth that's hard to find today.\n\nPolitics March 24, 2025\n\nMike Johnson’s House Math Problem Gets Easier to Solve\n\nThe speaker will soon have a (slightly) larger GOP majority for the next legislative battle.\n\nPodcast March 22, 2025\n\nNo Rulers\n\nIntellectual earworms, stand-up comedy, and chinchilla farms.\n\nWorth Your Time\n\nHamas’ October 7, 2023, attack and the ensuing war laid bare major intra-Democratic Party divisions over U.S. support for Israel. But those fissures are increasingly evident on the American right, too, as antisemitic conspiracy theories take hold in populist circles, argued New York Times columnist Ross Douthat. “More so than in the Democratic Party, most Republican elites remain staunchly pro-Israel. But on what you might call the alienated right—younger, conspiracy-curious, anti-institutional and very online—there is a vogue for arguments about malign Jewish influences on Western politics, ranging from World War II revisionism to narratives casting Jeffrey Epstein as a cat’s paw for the Mossad,” he wrote. “There’s just no way for mainstream Zionist Republicanism and the anti-Jewish faction on the alienated right to get along. … Those parts of the alienated right that are most comfortable deploying antisemitic tropes also believe earnestly not just in some general theory of Jewish power but in a specific theory of Israel’s power, Israel’s malign influence, Israeli leaders and institutions and spies as conspiratorial and destructive forces in American life.”\n\nIt’s been 18 months since devastating fires in Maui destroyed more than 2,000 homes. But only 6 have been rebuilt. In City Journal, Alex Hu examined the web of regulations, laws, and local government failures that have made the island’s efforts to rebuild so lethargic. “The political divide has only grown wider since the fires. Aside from activists seeking Internet fame by provoking viral confrontations at public meetings, radical councilmembers have called their pro-building colleagues names like ‘colonizer,’ openly questioned what would happen if they defied Hawaii state law promoting homebuilding, and advocated for secession from the United States. A general spirit of conspiracy and bad faith pervades the island’s politics,” he wrote. “These local dynamics discouraged Governor [Josh] Green from taking aggressive action. Suspicious residents interpreted his initial promises to rebuild Lahaina quickly as a plot to redevelop the historic town to profit ‘outside’ developers. He backed off in response. Even Mayor [Richard] Bissen has avoided taking strong actions or asking for strong state assistance for fear of looking like an outsider dictating terms to West Maui.”\n\nNBC News: Putin Said He Prayed for ‘His Friend’ Donald Trump After 2024 Assassination Attempt, U.S. Envoy [Steve Witkoff] Says\n\nWitkoff said some people might question if he should have met with the Russian president because they see Putin as “a bad guy.” But he said: “I don’t regard Putin as a bad guy.”\n\nA real estate tycoon and friend of the president who has become a top diplomatic envoy for Trump, Wiktoff said he appreciated Putin being open to meeting with him and communicating in a “straightforward” way.\n\n“I liked him. I thought he was straight up with me,” he said, adding that “it was gracious of him to accept me, to see me.”\n\nBloomberg: Secret Biden Deal Allowed Chevron to Pay Venezuela Millions\n\nThe Biden administration secretly permitted Chevron Corp. to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to the Venezuelan government despite a license that explicitly prohibited such disbursements, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe supplement to a November 2022 sanctions waiver allowed Chevron to remain in compliance with US law while paying the regime of President Nicolás Maduro taxes and oil royalties, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing non-public information.\n\nAxios: Seniors Won’t Complain if They Miss a Social Security Check, Lutnick Says\n\n“Let’s say Social Security didn’t send out their checks this month.

She’d think something got messed up, and she’ll get it next month. A fraudster always makes the loudest noise, screaming, yelling and complaining.”\n\nIn the Zeitgeist\n\nThe second season of Severance, the popular dystopian thriller starring Adam Scott of Parks and Recreation fame, came to a close last week on yet another cliffhanger.

        "full_text": "“A lot of people in Canada are liking becoming our beautiful, cherished 51st state. They’ll have to pay much lower taxes.”\n\n— President Donald Trump, remarks to the media, Feb. 25\n\n“They [Canadians] wouldn’t be paying for these tariffs. They’d have much lower taxes if they were part of this great country.”\n\n— White House press secretary Katherine Leavitt, remarks at a news briefing, March 6\n\nTrump has made it clear that he thinks Canada, a NATO member that shares a 5,500-mile border with the United States, should give up its sovereignty and become the 51st state. One of his main arguments is that it makes financial sense.\n\nNot only would he not impose tariffs — which he wrongly claims are paid by Canadians when in fact they are largely paid by American importers and consumers — but he and his press secretary argue that Canadians would face “much lower taxes” if they joined the United States.\n\nAre they right?\n\nThe Facts\n\nFirst, we confirmed with the White House that Trump and Leavitt were not simply suggesting the elimination of tariffs would mean lower taxes. A White House official said they were referring to income tax rates and sent us a link to an article on an independent Canadian news website, The Hub, that said “Canada’s marginal tax rates are much higher than America’s.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat are marginal tax rates? That refers to the tax imposed on each additional dollar of income. Both the U.S. and Canadian systems are progressive, meaning tax rates get higher as a person’s income increases. Canada starts at 15 percent, and the U.S. starts at 10 percent — but the top American rate is 37 percent, compared with 33 percent for Canadians.\n\nIn other words, a person making $750,000 in the United States would be paying a 37 percent rate in the U.S., compared with 33 percent in Canada. The United States also levies an additional 3.8 percent tax on investment income once income is above $250,000. So the marginal income-tax rate, in effect, could be above 40 percent in the United States.\n\nThe Hub article combines both state (or, in the case of Canada, province) and federal income taxes to calculate the marginal rates. Because Canadian provinces have higher income tax rates than U.S. states (some of which have zero income taxes), they all rank higher than the state with the highest marginal rate — California. The article quoted University of Calgary economics professor Trevor Tombe as saying that marginal tax rates, especially at higher incomes, were a factor in wealthy earners seeking to work in the United States.\n\nBut it’s very difficult to compare the tax systems of different nations on an apples-to-apples basis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCanada, for instance, does not permit a deduction for mortgage payments, a somewhat sacred cow in the U.S. system. Canada also has a universal health care system — which is administered at the provincial level, one reason the provinces have higher tax rates. The United States has no such health-care system except for Medicaid (for the poor) and Medicare (for the elderly). Instead, Americans must fork over their own money for health insurance or get health coverage through their employer (which in effect is part of their income, though untaxed).\n\nIn other words, marginal rates tell only part of the story. Tax deductions can mitigate those rates — or they can help pay for things, such as health insurance, that are not provided in another country.\n\nCristina Enache, global tax economist at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, said the overall tax burden (the ratio of taxes to gross domestic product) is much higher in Canada than the United States: 34.8 percent versus 25.2 percent. (This figure includes corporate taxes, so it’s broader than just individual taxes.) Excluding health care spending in each country, she calculated the average tax burden in the U.S. would be 18.96 percent, while in Canada it would be 22.48 percent. That’s a difference of 3.5 percentage points, including corporate taxes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTombe said that perhaps the most relevant and authoritative comparison at the individual level was a report, “Taxing Wages,” that is released annually by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes the world’s wealthiest nations. “This is a good comparable measure across countries that is relevant for most individuals,” he said.\n\nThe OECD focuses on what it calls the “tax wedge.” This is a more sophisticated measure than the marginal tax rate because it includes income taxes and payroll taxes (for programs like Social Security) and also subtracts cash benefits that people receive from the government. In essence, it measures the difference between the labor costs to the employer and the corresponding net take-home pay of the employee.\n\nGoing through the 2023 report — which measures the tax wedge across many income categories — it’s clear that both the United States and Canada have relatively low tax rates in the OECD. The average tax wedge among OECD nations is 34.8 percent of labor costs — and Canada stands at 31.9 percent and the United States at 29.9 percent. By comparison, the highest level was reached by Belgium, at 52.7 percent, followed by Germany (47.9 percent), Austria (47.2 percent) and France (46.8 percent).\n\nThe United States and Canada were also close in the tax wedge for single earners and for one-earner couples with children; both gave a similar tax preference to families. The biggest difference between the two countries was on the taxes imposed on two-earner couples with children. Canada and the United States were still below the OECD average, but Canada’s tax wedge was 28.8 percent and the United States was 24.6 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“While Canadian taxes are slightly higher than the U.S., the difference is minor and both countries have tax rates below the OECD average,” Tombe said.\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nTrump and Leavitt claim that Canadians would pay “much lower taxes” if they joined the United States. That’s a stretch. While marginal rates are higher in Canadian provinces than in American states, Canadians presumably would have to give up government-provided health insurance. Moreover, when assessed by the OECD, there’s not much difference between overall taxes at the individual level in Canada and the United States. Canada is slightly higher, even with better benefits, and both countries have relatively low tax rates compared to their peer group. The overall tax burden gets higher in Canada when corporate taxes are included, but Trump was talking about individual taxes.\n\nIt’s not quite Four Pinocchios, but the White House claim is mostly false.\n\nTrump earns Three Pinocchios.\n\nThree Pinocchios\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles"

        "full_text": "Mia Love, the first US black Republican congresswoman, has died aged 49 in Utah, her family has announced.\n\n\"She passed away peacefully\" on Sunday, surrounded by family at her home in the town of Saratoga Springs, a statement said.\n\nLove, a daughter of Haitian immigrants, had represented the state of Utah in the House of Representatives.\n\nHer daughter Abigale said earlier this month that Love had no longer been responding to treatment for brain cancer.\n\n\"In the midst of a celebration of her life and an avalanche of happy memories, Mia quietly slipped the bands of mortality and, as her words and vision always did, soared heavenward,\" said the family statement, which was posted on X.\n\nPaying tributes to Love, Utah Governor Spencer Cox wrote: \"A true trailblazer and visionary leader, Mia inspired countless Utahns through her courage, grace, and unwavering belief in the American dream.\n\n\"Her legacy leaves a lasting, positive impact on our state. We will miss her deeply.\"\n\nMia Love's political career formally started in 2003 when she won a seat on the Saratoga Springs' city council, and she later became the mayor, aged 34.\n\nIn 2014, she was elected to the US House of Representatives. She made history as the first black Republican woman to take up the role, and served two terms.\n\nLove was critical of Donald Trump when he was running for president in 2016, endorsing instead his Republican nomination rival Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who dropped out of the race a few months later.\n\nShe also called for Trump to publicly apologise for making derogatory comments about Haiti in 2018.\n\nHer bid for a third term ended in a razor-thin defeat to her Democratic rival Ben McAdams.\n\nTrump reacted to that by saying at a news conference: \"Mia Love gave me no love, and she lost.\"\n\nBefore entering politics, the mother of three worked for some time as a flight attendant.\n\nAs a teenager she dreamed of an acting career, later graduating from the University of Hartford in Connecticut with a degree in musical theatre.\n\nIn 2022, Love was diagnosed with glioblastoma, a fast-moving and aggressive form of brain cancer, and was given just 10-15 months to live - which she surpassed.\n\nHer death comes nearly two weeks after Love wrote an opinion piece for Deseret News, which she said was \"not to say goodbye but to say thank you and express my living wish for you and the America I know\"."

        "full_text": "WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Mondaytackled an unusual case in which civil rights groups are in a tentative alliance with Republican officials in defending a Louisiana congressional map that includes two majority Black districts for the first time in decades.\n\nThe justices heard oral arguments in an appeal brought by the state over its efforts to draw a map while being sued from the left and right about whether it appropriately considered race in doing so.\n\nAs in previous cases on these issues, some conservatives on the court questioned whether the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act's requirement that race be considered when drawing districts is compatible with the Constitution's 14th Amendment, which conservatives say bars any consideration of race.\n\nThe Supreme Court's 6-3 conservative majority is often receptive to conservative claims that the Constitution is “colorblind,” meaning no consideration of race can ever be lawful even if it is aimed at remedying past discrimination.\n\nBut while there might be an appetite on the court to potentially strike down a key provision of the voting rights law at some point, the Louisiana dispute does not squarely raise the legal question, so the court could be more likely to uphold the map in a narrow ruling.\n\nAs recently as 2023, the court reaffirmed the Voting Rights Act in a congressional redistricting case arising from Alabama. The vote was 5-4, with two conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, joining the court's three liberals in the majority. The Louisiana case could end up with a similar lineup.\n\nThe case has a complicated history, resulting from an original map drawn by the Legislature after the 2020 census that included just one Black majority district out of the state's six districts. About a third of the state's population is Black.\n\nCivil rights groups, including the Legal Defense Fund, sued and ultimately won, arguing that the Voting Rights Act required two majority Black districts.\n\nThat led to a new lawsuit filed by a group of self-identified \"non-African American\" voters led by Phillip Callais and 11 other plaintiffs who said the latest map, which is currently in effect, violated the 14th Amendment.\n\nA federal court struck the new map down, but the state successfully asked the Supreme Court to block the ruling last year, meaning the map was used in November's election. Rep. Cleo Fields, D-La., ultimately won the newly drawn district.\n\nNow, the Supreme Court is deciding whether the 2024 map can remain in place, weighing several legal questions.\n\nDuring the argument, Kavanaugh repeated concerns he raised in the 2023 case that there should be an end point for race to be considered in redistricting, indicating he could eventually be a vote to strike down Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\n\n\"The court has long said that race-based remedial action must have a logical end point, must be limited in time, must be a temporary matter,\" Kavanaugh said.\n\nConservative Justice Neil Gorsuch asked similar questions.\n\n\"Isn't saying race was one consideration another way of saying race predominated? And how do we square that with the 14th Amendment's promise that race should play no role?\" he asked.\n\nRoberts, meanwhile, questioned whether the congressional map met redistricting criteria because the newly drawn second majority Black district is not sufficiently compact. He described it as a \"snake that runs from one of the state to the other.\"\n\nSeveral justices, perhaps seeing an easy way to resolve the case, focused on precedent saying that states need leeway to draw the districts of their choosing. Other Supreme Court precedent says states are free to consider partisan politics as part of that calculation.\n\nLiberal Justice Elena Kagan said that in drafting the new map, the state was focused on politics, not race, because it drew the lines in a way that protected Republican incumbents, including House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\n\"If the state can't do that, the state has no breathing room,\" she added.\n\nIn a similar vein, liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that based on the earlier Voting Rights Act litigation, the state had a \"good faith basis\" for believing it needed to comply with the law.\n\nFellow liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pointed out that the Supreme Court has never held that race is a key factor when states are drawing maps to comply with the Voting Rights Act.\n\n\"I thought we suggested the opposite,\" she added.\n\nIn defending the new map, Louisiana Solicitor General Benjamin Aguiñaga wrote in court papers that currently the state is being sued no matter what it does, causing it to spend millions of dollars on legal expenses.\n\n\"No one truly wins that fight — the state loses, its voters lose, the judiciary loses, and democracy itself loses,\" he wrote.\n\nThe challengers said in court papers that the new map constitutes an \"odious racial gerrymander.\" None of the state's reasons constitute a \"compelling justification for violating the 14th Amendment,\" they added."
