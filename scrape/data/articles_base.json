        "full_text": "The announcement by the new Donald Trump administration to suspend foreign aid spending — approximately $68 billion annually — has sent shock waves across the world. This decision will not only affect military aid, which makes up a large percentage of the total, but also threatens funding for development aid, human rights campaigns, and initiatives that support democratic institutions — even as US foreign policy tends to undermine the stated goals of its aid. The executive order immediately raised concerns in the mainstream press about the United States neglecting its duty to Ukraine in its war with Russia and the abandonment of numerous humanitarian missions across the underdeveloped world.\n\nThe general response to this announcement, however, reinforces a long-standing false dichotomy: the notion that US and Western humanitarian and developmental interventionism operates independently of these nations’ broader, overtly aggressive geopolitical and imperialist interests. In this context, President Trump’s announcement should not be seen as an attack on the “friendlier” side of US foreign policy but rather an alignment of its outward form with its substance, unveiling the true purpose of foreign aid in serving US ruling-class interests — now all stick and no carrot.\n\nUSAID and NGOism\n\nAlongside overt forms of domination — military interventions, territorial acquisition, direct political interference — Western powers have long developed parallel forms of intervention and control, sometimes called informal imperialism. Over the last few decades, a refinement and perfecting of these more subtle instruments of domination has sometimes partially displaced older forms. Due to its proximity to the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean have been important testing grounds for these practices.\n\nHistorically, these have involved policies such as promoting US ideology and culture with Christian missions or Hollywood blockbusters (the softest of soft imperialism), subordinating governments by covertly financing opposition political parties or presidential candidates, and the use of economic sanctions. The region has also witnessed an increasing reliance on developmental aid programs, a trend that can be traced to the advent of so-called multilateral aid initiatives led by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the mid-twentieth century. These organizations and initiatives were later used to compel nations in the Global South to adopt neoliberal policies, reinforcing their dependency on the United States and Europe.\n\nThis form of imperialism has empowered so-called civil society — nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and civil society organizations (CSOs) — in the peripheralized regions. Among them are groups concerned with poverty and inequality, human rights, and, increasingly, the ecological crisis whose humanitarian interventions have often coincided with and even legitimated neoliberal reforms.\n\nInstrumental to the mushrooming of these organizations have been Western developmental agencies — most notably, the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the World Bank, and, more recently, the European Union’s numerous developmental aid programs. The latter actor has used the region as a testing ground for its “civilian power” approach to foreign policy since the late 1990s.\n\nThese Western developmental aid and humanitarian programs are not only fundamentally incapable of addressing the region’s severe social and ecological crises; they have also served as tools to reinforce the very structures that perpetuate these problems. Nearly a century into this model of interventionism, the historical conditions of poverty, inequality, exploitation, and oppression — the very issues these programs aim to resolve — remain intact even as new markets have been wrenched open.\n\nThe Early Laboratories of Civil Society\n\nLike neoliberalism itself, much of this began in earnest in Chile. The US-backed military coup that overthrew the country’s socialist government in 1973 was the culmination of a more comprehensive foreign intervention that had started years earlier. Thousands of documents declassified by the US government between 1999 and 2000 confirmed the CIA’s involvement. The economic war and the military coup were the culmination of a broader effort, going as far back as the early 1960s, to keep Chile’s socialists out of power. Central to this effort was the funding and influencing of civil society groups such as trade unions, religious groups, and women’s organizations.\n\nWith Augusto Pinochet’s installation as dictator, Chile not only became a laboratory for neoliberal policies but also an important site for the deployment and development of Western-backed NGOs, particularly human rights ones. In other words, at the same time as the United States and Europe backed and facilitated Chile’s dictatorship and the brutal oppression of its population, they also played a role in its partial relief, funding human rights NGOs that performed roles as varied as denouncing the dictatorship’s abuses and providing meals for impoverished families.\n\nAs highlighted by James Petras in his extensive research on the matter, the growth of Western-backed NGOs in Latin America and the Caribbean coincided with Operation Condor, a campaign of terror against leftist leaders and movements and the installment of US-backed regimes beginning in the 1970s. By superficially alleviating some of the more obvious fallout from the installation of repressive regimes and the neoliberal economic policies they immediately adopted, these civil society organizations played the complementary role of neutralizing more organic and radical political and social movements, co-opting or weakening them and their leadership with the vast resources at their disposal.\n\nWith more significant funding from multilateral organizations like the World Bank beginning in the 1980s and, notably, from USAID and European developmental programs since the turn of the twenty-first century, these civil society groups have reproduced themselves across the region and become crucial to Western foreign policy.\n\nDemocracy According to USAID\n\nBy the 1990s, with the region’s leftist movement weakened in the aftermath of Operation Condor and former dictatorships transitioning back to electoral democracies, the West’s focus in Latin America shifted from NGOs concerned with human rights abuses to those promoting democracy and development, with the former cause increasingly integrated into the latter.\n\nOperating in the region since its founding in the early 1960s, USAID took a stronger role in the 1990s as the friendly side of US interventionism. It poured hundreds of millions of dollars into Haiti for NGO initiatives and state-led “democratic” programs, financed microdevelopment projects in rural Paraguay to dissuade peasants from supporting insurgent groups, and countered the rapidly growing socialist movement in Bolivia through a multimillion-dollar democracy-building campaign.\n\nThis multifaceted approach to sustaining US hegemony in the region would eventually be joined and, in some countries, rivaled by other Western powers. From the early 2000s, the European Union began testing its novel civil society approach to foreign policy in war-ridden Colombia, proposing an alternative to the US-backed Plan Colombia, a hawkish counterinsurgent policy and corollary to the domestic US “war on drugs.”\n\nBut the EU’s so-called Peace Laboratories, receiving tens of millions of euros between 2002 and 2010, would, in fact, be implemented in Colombia alongside the counterinsurgency program, contributing to the weakening of revolutionary left-wing movements and their social base through, among other things, financing microdevelopmental projects that tied peasants in conflict areas to the agricultural exports industry. Moreover, as the Campaign Against Arms Trade highlighted, EU member states like the UK (then still part of the EU) and Spain contributed directly to the US-backed militarist efforts to subdue the population at the same time as the peacebuilding project.\n\nAs the United States made massive military transfers to Colombia, the EU surpassed it as the principal donor of developmental aid to Latin America and the Caribbean in the early 2000s. This developmental investment was accompanied by the intensification of trade between Latin America and Europe, which today approaches the region’s trade with the United States, facilitated further by several bloc-to-bloc free trade agreements, all of them containing normative clauses and conditions.\n\nThough firmly aligned with violent, militaristic forms of intervention, European Union aid, USAID, and other such developmental agencies have worked in the region with relatively little scrutiny or opposition. This is largely due to the widespread assumption that their projects are inherently benevolent and a force for good.\n\nThis can be observed today in USAID’s continued allocation of millions of dollars to the region, most recently under the guise of aiding Venezuela’s migrants. It is also reflected in the World Bank’s annual loans, amounting to the tens of billions for so-called “sustainable” development programs, and the European Union’s yearly contribution of one hundred million euros in humanitarian aid — dwarfed by the approximate three hundred billion euros in goods traded annually between the EU and Latin America.\n\nImperialism Was Never Friendly\n\nThe contemporary practice of informal imperialism — of developmental aid and humanitarianism specifically — has become the favored form of tapping into new markets and maintaining favorable conditions for investment in the Global South. In this regard, the Western aid and NGO project in Latin America and the Caribbean has mostly been a success story.\n\nHow permanent the Trump administration’s pause in aid becomes remains to be seen. Either way, the change in foreign policy will likely face significant resistance among both state actors and capital, as such soft power has proven an effective tool in furthering imperial and ruling-class interests. For the rest of us, these troubling times present an opportunity to focus on those interests and how they’re advanced across administrations and policy regimes. This means unmasking the illusion of friendly US and European foreign policy and challenging its contempt for the world’s oppressed majorities not only when displayed openly but also when carefully concealed behind a facade of humanitarian benevolence.",

        "full_text": "Employees of the Hungarian radio station Klubradio work at its headquarters in Budapest, Hungary, February 6, 2025. REUTERS/Bernadett Szabo Employees of the Hungarian radio station Klubradio work at its headquarters in Budapest, Hungary, February 6, 2025. REUTERS/Bernadett Szabo , Summary USAID has helped fund independent media in eastern Europe Many outlets reeling from Trump actions against USAID They say loss of funds hits ability to hold power to account Hungary, Bosnia, Georgia among countries most impacted BUDAPEST/SARAJEVO, Feb 13 (Reuters) - At a Feb. 10 editorial meeting of Hungarian investigative outlet Atlatszo, journalists discussed how they might raise money after their grants from USAID intermediaries were halted amid U.S. President Donald Trump's drive to shutter the agency. \"Without these funds it would be very hard to maintain independent media here (in Hungary),\" Atlatszo's managing editor Tamas Bodoky told Reuters, adding that they would seek new donors and try to increase crowdfunding. Atlatszo, a non-profit outlet set up in 2011, has published investigations on corruption, Hungarian oligarchs close to the government and the fate of EU funds, among other issues. Bodoky said USAID indirectly financed some 10-15% of its budget in 2023 and 2024. Trump's decision - first to freeze most funds disbursed by USAID for 90 days and put most of its staff on leave and then to ask billionaire Elon Musk to scale down the agency - has caused chaos for NGOs and humanitarian projects worldwide. While the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) distributes billions of dollars of humanitarian aid, it has also been involved in many other projects, including those aimed at strengthening civil society and democracy worldwide. USAID opened , new programmes in central Europe in late 2022, supporting locally-driven initiatives to bolster democratic institutions and independent media - much to the chagrin of Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a Trump ally who has welcomed the U.S. president's moves against the agency. Although the ultimate fate of many USAID programmes remains uncertain, the Trump administration has indicated it does not see supporting journalism in countries where rights groups say press freedom is limited as a good use of U.S. public funds. \"The US radical-left has been using US taxpayer money to fund radical-left political parties & media around the world,” Musk wrote on X on January 29. Both Musk and Trump have branded USAID as \"corrupt\", without providing evidence. Trump's moves against USAID prompted Orban to say on February 7 that he wants to eliminate all \"foreign networks\" of NGOs and media critical of his government, fuelling fears that it will embolden him and other illiberal governments to enact clampdowns on media they deem to be unfriendly. \"Money from abroad cannot be allowed to influence Hungarian politics, and we shall enforce this legally, with those who are complicit in this facing legal consequences,\" said Orban, who faces a challenging election in 2026 amid a struggling economy. Orban has transformed Hungary's media landscape over the past 14 years. State media have been put under full government control and several private media outlets shut or taken over by government-friendly owners. Tight media control has helped Orban win the past three elections with a landslide. PRESS FREEDOM In 2024, Hungary ranked 67th on the World Press Freedom Index , , down from 23rd in 2010 when Orban took power, with its ranking well below that of Poland or the Czech Republic. Georgia and Bosnia - two other eastern European countries heavily impacted by Trump's efforts to dismantle USAID - ranked 103rd and 81st, respectively, for press freedom last year. The Sarajevo-based \"Umbrella\" association, a hub for 13 non-profit media involved in investigative journalism in the Balkans, is among organisations waiting to know if USAID donations will resume after Trump's 90-day financing freeze. \"If U.S. donations to media in Bosnia and Herzegovina were to be halted (permanently), some of them would be forced to reduce the scope of their work... cutting the number of serious stories about corruption, organised crime and abuse of power,\" said Umbrella director Milica Samardzic. Paulina Milewska, a researcher for the European University Institute in Florence, Italy, also cited the risk that media outlets that lose USAID funding will need to cut back on deeper coverage. While the U.S. government has long helped fund media organisations all over the world, eastern Europe has always been a major focus dating back to the Cold War, when the CIA helped establish outlets to sway public opinion against communism. Musk called on February 9 for the closure of Radio Free Europe (RFE) – which has been funded by U.S. government money separate to USAID since 1950 – saying it was a \"relic of the past\". In an emailed reply to Reuters, RFE declined to comment. After the USAID freeze, the European Federation of Journalists (EFJ) called on European institutions and foundations , to mobilise in support of media pluralism and independent journalism, saying Trump's move would cause \"chaos in the media ecosystem of over 30 countries around the world, including many European countries\". These include Georgia, where tens of thousands of people have been protesting for months against a government they see as pro-Russian and authoritarian and which has suspended negotiations to join the European Union. Among media outlets there affected by Trump's decision is English language news site OC-Media, which said it had lost funding for three USAID-backed projects. \"Without independent journalism, there will be no one to hold power to account,\" said its co-founder, Dominik Cagara.

        "full_text": "Fired USAid employees and advocates for people with HIV staged a protest in a Capitol office building on Wednesday, warning that Donald Trump’s drive to dismantle the agency tasked with implementing Washington’s foreign aid agenda imperils the fight against the virus.\n\nWearing white T-shirts that read “Aids funding cuts kill” and chanting “Congress has blood on its hands, unfreeze aid now”, around three dozen protesters lay down in the rotunda of the Cannon House office building, home to the offices of representatives from both parties. Capitol police said about 20 arrests were made of demonstrators who defied their orders to disperse.\n\n“What we are demanding of Congress is that they stop behaving like doormats in the face of this attack on humanitarian assistance that truly is highly effective and life-saving,” Asia Russell, executive director of Health Gap, a global advocacy group fighting against HIV, said prior to the protest.\n\n“It’s very hard to overstate what’s at stake regarding humanitarian assistance.”\n\nThe protest came as USAid remained frozen by the Trump administration’s rapid moves to close the agency. Over the weekend, the agency announced that it was placing all but a small number of its employees worldwide, as well as nearly 2,000 staffers based in the United States, on paid leave. Those working in Washington DC have been invited to retrieve their belongings from its headquarters, which is set to be turned into office space for US Customs and Border Protection, one of the agencies implementing Trump’s hardline immigration policies.\n\nOn Tuesday, a federal judge reportedly gave the government a two-day deadline to release billions of dollars in foreign aid funds that had been held back after Trump ordered USAid to stop work. If those funds are not restored, former USAid employees who attended the protest at the Capitol warned, the global fight against HIV will be set back.\n\nThe United States has been a leader in the campaign against the virus that causes Aids through Pepfar, a program that provides medication to 20 million people worldwide and was established during Republican George W Bush’s presidency. But USAid’s abrupt closure has stopped payments to providers working with the program worldwide.\n\n“This is not controversial, and what is happening is not government efficiency, it’s government fraud, waste and abuse when it comes to what Doge is doing,” said the fired USAid contractor Van Credle, referring to Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency”, which spearheaded the dismantling of her agency as well as other deep cuts to federal services.\n\nThe Republican majorities elected to both the Senate and House last November have thus far shown little interest in saving USAid and even supported its closure, despite the fact that foreign assistance has in the past enjoyed support on both sides of the aisle. Kelsey Crow, a contractor at the agency’s bureau of global health who lost her job, said the protest was meant to encourage lawmakers who previously supported USAid to step up.\n\n“So much of our work at USAid is mandated by Congress, and so for Congress to not be taking action, for Congress to be holding hearings that are pushing out lies and falsehoods about USAid to say that the waivers are back when we know that they’re actually not turned on and the money’s not actually flowing, it’s incredibly disappointing,” Crow said.\n\nPeter Kerndt, a physician who spent five years with USAid coordinating the fight against tuberculosis in African and Asian countries, said it will be “impossible” to achieve a global goal of eliminating the virus by 2030 if the agency goes away.\n\n“For this administration, for Elon Musk to call USAid a criminal organization that should die and to gleefully celebrate that he spent the weekend putting USAid in the wood chipper instead of going to a party is such an insult to all of the workers, both here and in the country,” he said. “But most of all, the people that suffer are the people that we were there to help.”\n\nAndrew Roth contributed reporting",

        "full_text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration said it is eliminating more than 90% of the U.S. Agency for International Development’s foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall U.S. assistance around the world, putting numbers on its plans to eliminate the majority of U.S. development and humanitarian help abroad.\n\nThe cuts detailed by the administration would leave few surviving USAID projects for advocates to try to save in what are ongoing court battles with the administration.\n\nThe Trump administration outlined its plans in both an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press and filings in one of those federal lawsuits Wednesday.\n\nThe Supreme Court intervened in that case late Wednesday and temporarily blocked a court order requiring the administration to release billions of dollars in foreign aid by midnight.\n\nWednesday’s disclosures also give an idea of the scale of the administration’s retreat from U.S. aid and development assistance overseas, and from decades of U.S. policy that foreign aid helps U.S. interests by stabilizing other countries and economies and building alliances.\n\nThe memo said officials were “clearing significant waste stemming from decades of institutional drift.” More changes are planned in how USAID and the State Department deliver foreign assistance, it said, “to use taxpayer dollars wisely to advance American interests.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump and ally Elon Musk have hit foreign aid harder and faster than almost any other target in their push to cut the size of the federal government. Both men say USAID projects advance a liberal agenda and are a waste of money.\n\nTrump on Jan. 20 ordered what he said would be a 90-day program-by-program review of which foreign assistance programs deserved to continue, and cut off all foreign assistance funds almost overnight.\n\nThe funding freeze has stopped thousands of U.S.-funded programs abroad, and the administration and Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency teams have pulled the majority of USAID staff off the job through forced leave and firings.\n\nWidely successful USAID programs credited with containing outbreaks of Ebola and other threats and saving more than 20 million lives in Africa through HIV and AIDS treatment are among those still cut off from agency funds, USAID officials and officials with partner organizations say. Meanwhile, formal notifications of program cancellations are rolling out.\n\nIn the federal court filings Wednesday, nonprofits owed money on contracts with USAID describe both Trump political appointees and members of Musk’s teams terminating USAID’s contracts around the world at breakneck speed, without time for any meaningful review, they say.\n\n“‘There are MANY more terminations coming, so please gear up!’'' a USAID official wrote staff Monday, in an email quoted by lawyers for the nonprofits in the filings.\n\nThe nonprofits, among thousands of contractors, owed billions of dollars in payment since the freeze began, called the en masse contract terminations a maneuver to get around complying with the order to lift the funding freeze temporarily.\n\nSo did a Democratic lawmaker.\n\nThe administration was attempting to “blow through Congress and the courts by announcing the completion of their sham ‘review’ of foreign aid and the immediate termination of thousands of aid programs all over the world,” said Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nA coalition representing major U.S. and global businesses and nongovernmental organizations and former officials expressed shock at the move. “The American people deserve a transparent accounting of what will be lost — on counterterror, global health, food security, and competition,” the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition said.\n\nThe State Department said Secretary of State Marco Rubio had reviewed the terminations.\n\nIn all, the Trump administration said it will eliminate 5,800 of 6,200 multiyear USAID contract awards, for a cut of $54 billion. Another 4,100 of 9,100 State Department grants were being eliminated, for a cut of $4.4 billion.\n\nThe State Department memo, which was first reported by the Washington Free Beacon, described the administration as spurred by a federal court order that gave officials until the end of the day Wednesday to lift the Trump administration’s monthlong block on foreign aid funding.\n\n“In response, State and USAID moved rapidly,” targeting USAID and State Department foreign aid programs in vast numbers for contract terminations, the memo said.\n\nTrump administration officials — after repeated warnings from the federal judge in the case — also said Wednesday they were finally beginning to send out their first or any payments after more than a month with no known spending. Officials were processing a few million dollars of back payments, officials said, owed to U.S. and international organizations and companies.\n\nBut U.S. District Judge Amir H. Ali’s order to unfreeze billions of dollars by midnight Wednesday will remain on hold until the Supreme Court has a chance to weigh in more fully, according to the brief order signed by Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nAli had ordered the federal government to comply with his decision temporarily blocking a freeze on foreign aid, ruling in a lawsuit filed by nonprofit groups and businesses. An appellate panel refused the administration’s request to intervene before the high court weighed in.\n\nThe plaintiffs have until noon Friday to respond, Roberts said.\n\nThe administration has filed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court in one other case so far, arguing that a lower court was wrong to reinstate the head of a federal watchdog agency after Trump fired him.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Gary Fields in Washington and Rebecca Boone in Boise, Idaho, contributed to this report.",

        "full_text": "Like a child custody battle in a throuple, U.S. tech companies are getting pulled in three directions as the Trump administration abandons its predecessor's tacit tolerance, if not always explicit approval, for official censorship in the European Union and Brazil.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission joined the Federal Communications Commission in pressuring Big Tech to back off content moderation that allegedly suppresses conservative speech and challenges to establishment narratives compared to other speech, an evolution of the agencies' history of turf wars on internet policy issues.\n\nPresident Trump issued another sweeping executive order Friday that includes investigating and countering U.K. and EU policies that may have \"the effect of requiring or incentivizing the use or development\" of U.S.-made products and services \"in ways that undermine freedom of speech and political engagement or otherwise moderate content.\"\n\nTrump Media and Technology Group, home of the president's Truth Social, and video platform Rumble also got a reprieve from a federal court in their lawsuit against Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes for his censorship orders.\n\nU.S. District Judge Mary Scriven, nominated by President George W. Bush, ruled that Moraes didn't follow the Hague Convention or the countries' Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty in issuing his orders, so the plaintiffs didn't need a temporary restraining order to stop him.\n\n\"Censorship by technology platforms is not just un-American, it is potentially illegal,\" the FTC said, issuing a request for information that seeks public comment on consumer harm from \"potentially unfair or deceptive acts or practices, or potentially unfair methods of competition,\" and specifically input from \"current and former employees of technology platforms.\"\n\nIt asks for circumstances under which platforms have shadowbanned and demonetized users based on their speech and affiliations, what their \"public-facing representations\" said about moderation and whether users could appeal sanctions, what influenced such adverse actions and how they may have been enabled by lack of competition or weakened competition.\n\n\"Tech firms should not be bullying their users\" into silencing themselves based on viewpoint, said FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson, who was first appointed to the commission by President Biden and confirmed by the Senate less than a year ago.\n\nRoughly 1,000 comments had already been filed by Wednesday afternoon in a proceeding that runs through May 21, many without real names and either critical of the proceeding or implying President Trump and X owner Elon Musk are the real threat to free speech.\n\n\"The Trumpsters are censoring our ability to say Gulf of Mexico, he//him, etc.,\" commenter \"Andrew Ferguson\" wrote, referring to Trump's tiff with the Associated Press over the renamed \"Gulf of America\" and reported ban on federal employees listing their gender pronouns.\n\nIt appears to be the Trump FTC's first confirmed shot across the bow at Big Tech, arriving late to the party started by cell tower-climbing FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, dubbed a Trump \"sycophant\" by House Judiciary Committee Ranking Democrat Jamie Raskin for reinstating complaints against broadcast networks for their election coverage decisions including editing.\n\nLess than two weeks after the election, Trump-nominated Commissioner Carr said the \"censorship cartel\" that silenced Americans, with help from an \"Orwellian\" purported fact-checker, \"must be dismantled and destroyed.\"\n\nIn letters to Google and Facebook parent companies as well as Microsoft and Apple, Carr said their work with NewsGuard, a rating system for news and information websites, might not be in \"good faith,\" the condition for legal immunity under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.\n\nApple also has to fend off increasing attacks from conservative rabble-rousers.\n\nIt defeated four resolutions at its annual shareholder meeting this week including transparency on how it fights child sexual abuse material and its relationships with activists such as the Human Rights Campaign, which requires companies to pay for so-called gender affirming care for minors to perform well on its Corporate Equality Index.\n\nThe Alliance Defending Freedom, which helped lead the shareholder efforts, called it a win because \"this is the beginning of a conversation,\" in the words of Senior Vice President of corporate engagement Jeremy Tedesco.\n\n\"Apple has budged\" in response to their resolution against diversity, equity and inclusion \"and I think there's more budging to be done,\" Bowyer Research President Jerry Bowyer said, noting that Apple CEO Tim Cook suggested that legal changes may force it to recant DEI.\n\nThe FCC's Carr is a long-term skeptic of the breadth of Section 230 immunity as determined by courts, cheering President Biden's interest in \"removing Big Tech’s special Section 230 protections\" in 2022 while suggesting ways to avoid \"encouraging even more censorship.\"\n\nNew York Post business columnist Charles Gasparino said investors should prepare for Big Tech stocks tanking if Carr's \"inchoate\" plan for Section 230 regulatory review gets fleshed out as an advisory opinion that weakens or eliminates the liability shield on the grounds that platforms are no longer \"blind arbiter[s] of information.\"\n\nGasparino sees a \"good chance\" many courts, especially with conservative jurists, will rely on FCC guidance in Section 230 cases, giving new life to defamation claims against Big Tech, granting expensive legal discovery and prompting settlements.\n\nThe columnist buttressed his take by pointing to Section 230 caselaw in Silicon Valley's 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which most recently stripped immunity from Facebook in a class-action lawsuit against its algorithm discerning users' protected characteristics and letting advertisers discriminate in whom they target with housing ads based on those characteristics.\n\nCarr confirmed Big Tech scrutiny will be a hallmark of his chairmanship by hiring law professor Adam Candeub, long a vocal critic of Section 230 as interpreted by courts, as general counsel of the agency, the position Carr held before his elevation to commissioner.\n\nCarr also praised Trump's nomination of ex-FTC lawyer Gail Slater, onetime policy chief for the since-disbanded Internet Association, as Justice Department antitrust division chief, who will \"help rein in Big Tech and put an end to their abusive and anticompetitive practices.\"\n\nThe FTC and DOJ have their own history of turf wars, and Ferguson told staff last week he wanted the two \"singing from the same song sheet\" when it comes to merger reviews. He said it's better to keep the Biden administration's joint 2023 guidelines rather than spark a \"recriminatory cycle of partisan rescissions\" that harm business and confuse courts.\n\nThe first-month moves by the Trump-appointed chairmen coincide with the president's Feb. 18 executive order to exert more control over the FTC, FCC and Securities and Exchange Commission, which the order calls \"so-called independent agencies\" whose economy-straining rules and regulations have long escaped direct presidential review.",

        "full_text": "Summary Plaintiffs say Trump actions violate US law, Constitution Administration had asked US Supreme Court to intervene WASHINGTON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on Wednesday paused a federal judge's order requiring President Donald Trump 's administration to pay foreign aid funds to contractors and grant recipients. Roberts issued an interim order placing on hold Washington-based U.S. District Judge Amir Ali's action that had imposed a deadline of 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday night. Roberts provided no rationale for the order, known as an administrative stay, which will give the court additional time to consider the administration's more formal request to block Ali's ruling. Roberts asked for a response from the plaintiffs - organizations that contract with or receive grants from the U.S. Agency for International Development and the State Department - by noon on Friday. The order came after Trump's administration said in a court filing on Wednesday it had made final decisions terminating most U.S. foreign aid contracts and grants, while maintaining that it cannot meet Ali's court-ordered deadline. The administration is cutting more than 90% of the U.S. Agency for International Development's foreign aid contracts and over $58 billion in overall U.S. assistance around the world, a State Department spokesperson said separately, calling the cuts part of Trump's \"America First agenda.\" The foreign aid funding dispute arose from a pair of lawsuits brought by the aid organizations, alleging that the agencies have illegally frozen all foreign aid payments. The Trump administration has kept those payments largely frozen despite a February 13 temporary restraining order from Ali that they be released, and multiple subsequent orders that the administration comply, culminating in the Wednesday night deadline. Lawyers for the U.S. Justice Department have maintained that the administration has a right to suspend its agreements while it reviews them to determine whether they comply with administration policy. That review is now complete, the administration said in its new filing. It said USAID has made final decisions to cancel nearly 5,800 awards, while keeping more than 500, and that the State Department has canceled about 4,100 awards, while keeping about 2,700. An administration official said in an earlier court filing that grounds for terminating contracts include that they were related to diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility efforts, or were deemed wasteful. Trump has taken a hard line on programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion, signing an executive order in his second day in office last month directing federal agency chiefs to dismantle DEI policies . An American flag and USAID flag fly outside the USAID building in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 1, 2025. REUTERS/Annabelle Gordon/File Photo , The administration said on Wednesday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had ordered that past-due invoices from the plaintiffs for work before January 24, when the payment freeze began, to be \"expedited for payment without the ordinary vetting procedures, in a good-faith effort to comply\" with Ali's order. It said that while some money would be paid on Wednesday, full payments could take weeks. FUNDING FREEZE UNDERMINES RELIEF EFFORTS Trump, a Republican, ordered a 90-day pause on all foreign aid on his first day in office last month. That order, and ensuing stop-work orders halting USAID operations around the world, have jeopardized the delivery of life-saving food and medical aid, throwing global humanitarian relief efforts into chaos . USAID administers some 60% of U.S. foreign assistance and disbursed $43.79 billion in fiscal 2023. According to a Congressional Research Service report this month, its workforce of 10,000, of which about two-thirds serves overseas, assisted about 130 countries. Trump's administration on Sunday said it was placing all but leaders and critical staff at USAID on paid administrative leave and eliminating 1,600 positions . Employee unions have sued to challenge the cuts, though a judge last week allowed them to go ahead . Ali, who was appointed by Trump's Democratic predecessor, former President Joe Biden, issued his temporary restraining order to prevent irreparable harm to the plaintiffs while he considers their claims. The plaintiffs allege Trump has exceeded his authority under federal law and the U.S. Constitution by effectively dismantling an independent agency and canceling spending authorized by Congress. The plaintiffs have said the administration has not done anything to comply with the restraining order, and some have said they will shut down within days if they are not paid. \"The lengths that the government is willing to go to flout a court order, all for the goal of ending life-saving humanitarian assistance, is staggering,\" said Allison Zieve, a lawyer representing two plaintiffs, AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and Journalism Development Network, on Wednesday. Other plaintiffs include international development company DAI Global and refugee assistance organization HIAS. Both Ali and a Rhode Island federal judge in a separate case over a broader federal payment freeze have castigated the Trump administration for failing to follow their orders. The administration in both cases has maintained it is trying in good faith to interpret and comply with the orders.

        "full_text": "U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose 25% tariffs on imports from the European Union, claiming that the economic and political bloc was formed \"to screw\" the U.S.\n\nThe White House leader signaled the potential trade measures on Wednesday, during the first Cabinet meeting of his second term in office — a day before he announced that another set of proposed levies on Mexico and Canada will go into effect on March 4, noting that China will be charged an additional 10% tariff on the same date.\n\n\"We'll be announcing it very soon,\" he told reporters of the EU measures on Wednesday. \"It'll be [a] 25% [tariff] generally speaking, and that will be on cars and all other things.\"\n\nHe added, \"They've really taken advantage of us ... They don't accept our cars, they don't accept, essentially, our farm products. They use all sorts of reasons why not. And we accept everything of them.\"\n\nThe president has made it a priority to tackle what he sees as unfair trade relationships with a number of the U.S.' closest neighbors and trading partners, citing the U.S.' persistent trade deficits — in which it imports more goods and services than it exports — as evidence of this.\n\nTrump claimed, without citing evidence, that the EU had been formed to undermine the U.S.\n\n\"I love the countries of Europe. I guess I'm from there at some point, a long time ago, right? ... But [the] European Union was formed in order to screw the United States ... that's the purpose of it, and they've done a good job of it. But now I'm president,\" he said.\n\nThe EU was established after the 1993 enforcement of the Maastricht Treaty, building on post-war sentiment of European unity and cites establishing an internal market and achieving sustainable development among its aims.\n\nReacting to Trump's claims about the EU's origin, the Commission noted that the EU had benefitted the U.S.\n\n\"The European Union is the world's largest free market. And it has been a boon for the United States. By creating a large and integrated single market, the EU has facilitated trade, reduced costs for U.S. exporters, and harmonized standards and regulations across 27 countries. As a result, U.S. investments in Europe are highly profitable,\" the Commission said in a statement to CNBC.\n\nThe EU urged the U.S. to work with it \"to preserve these opportunities for our people and businesses. Not against each other.\"\n\nThe tariffs prospect is not new, with Trump having already threatened the EU and U.K. with levies. The White House leader had nevertheless previously signaled that a deal could be worked out with Britain, which has a much more balanced trading relationship with the U.S.\n\n— CNBC's Silvia Amaro contributed reporting to this story.",

        "full_text": "The U.S. Justice Department told Congress in November that there were no major disputes with the United Kingdom over how the two allies seek data from each other’s communication companies.\n\nBut at that time, officials knew British authorities were preparing a demand that Apple build a back door to its users’ encrypted data, according to people familiar with the process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal department matters.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on Tuesday called that British demand an “egregious” violation of American rights, and on Wednesday lawmakers asked the Justice Department to investigate.\n\nNovember’s report to Congress was required by law to renew an agreement that lets the U.K. obtain electronic data from U.S. providers without going through U.S. courts. In it, the Biden Justice Department certified that U.K. laws and procedures provided “robust substantive and procedural protections for privacy and civil liberties.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSen. Alex Padilla and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, both California Democrats, asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to reexamine that finding, saying Britain’s threat to compromise encryption violated the information-sharing deal between the two countries under the 2018 Cloud Act.\n\n“No entity, foreign or domestic, should be able to make Americans’ data more susceptible to breaches,” Padilla said. “That’s why we are demanding accountability, not just from other countries, but from the Department of Justice, which has the responsibility to keep Americans’ data safe — we must not set this terrible precedent.”\n\nThe U.K. ordered Apple in January to create a way for British authorities to obtain content that Apple users store in iCloud with Advanced Data Protection, an encryption option rolled out worldwide two years ago. That content is end-to-end encrypted, meaning only the user, and not Apple, can access it. Apple withdrew the encryption option in the U.K. on Friday rather than comply, an action that would have left its users with less security than they had been promised.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Justice Department’s 10-page report to the Foreign Relations and Judiciary committees of the House and Senate noted that unnamed U.S. companies had complained that the U.K. Investigatory Powers Act required advance notice if they wanted to enhance privacy or security in their services and that Britain could then block those offerings globally.\n\nThe department said it reminded its British counterpart of the Cloud Act’s “requirement that the terms of the Agreement shall not create any obligation that providers be capable of decrypting data.” The report did not mention the looming order, and said any demands for reduced security would come under Britain’s Investigatory Powers Act, and so were not within the scope of the Cloud Act.\n\nThe Justice Department official who conveyed that document to Congress referred questions Wednesday to a department spokeswoman, who said she had nothing to add to the report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Wednesday, Padilla and Lofgren faulted the November certification, saying “it splits the finest of hairs” by suggesting that the Cloud Act didn’t apply to any decryption order. The two lawmakers, who sit on the Judiciary committees in their respective chambers of Congress, asked Bondi to reconsider whether Britain was violating the Cloud Act by ordering a break to Apple’s encryption.\n\nTwo of the people familiar with the certification process said the FBI has pursued backdoor capabilities unsuccessfully in the United States and would have been in a stronger legal position to win that if Apple had already had to create such a mechanism for another government.\n\nThe FBI did not respond to a request for a comment. The U.K. Home Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment and has previously said it does not comment on “operational matters.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGabbard on Tuesday wrote to Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Arizona) saying she had directed a legal review of the order and had not known of it before it was reported by The Washington Post and confirmed by other publications. The legislators had urged her to act just after her confirmation as the top U.S. intelligence leader.\n\n“I share your grave concern about the serious implications of the United Kingdom, or any foreign country, requiring Apple or any company to create a ‘backdoor’ that would allow access to Americans’ personal encrypted data,” she wrote. “This would be a clear and egregious violation of Americans’ privacy and civil liberties, and open up a serious vulnerability for cyber exploitation by adversarial actors.”\n\nApple was prohibited from disclosing the order to Congress or U.S. regulators under the Investigatory Powers Act, which allows British officials to compel communications and technology providers to assist in government inquiries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile not addressing the existence of the order, when Apple said it was pulling the secure storage from U.K. customers it added that it had never built a back door into its products and never would.\n\nEven the U.K. pullout would not be enough to end the U.K. demand that the tech giant create the back door for spying on those in other countries. Gabbard’s complaints might do that, and she pledged to keep Congress apprised.\n\nThe Cloud Act cooperative agreement bars the British from deliberately seeking information on Americans, but forcing the creation of a universal back door would create a new target not just for law enforcement officials, but also for hackers and spies.\n\n“Any information sharing between a government — any government — and private companies must be done in a manner that respects and protects the U.S. law and the Constitutional rights of U.S. citizens,” Gabbard wrote. “I look forward to ensuring the UK government has taken necessary actions to protect the privacy of American citizens, consistent with the CLOUD Act and other applicable laws.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nU.K. officials and the FBI have complained that the increasing use of end-to-end encryption has stymied investigations into terrorism, child abuse and other serious crimes. Such communications can only be seen by the sending and receiving devices. Apple’s Advanced Data Protection, iMessages and FaceTime are end-to-end encrypted, as are Google Android backups and some chats, Meta’s Messenger and WhatsApp texts, and content sent over Signal.\n\nWhile acknowledging that strong encryption is used by criminals, the vast majority of security professionals and government cyber defenders have endorsed increased adoption as hackers win access to regular emails, text and voice calls.\n\n“Director Gabbard is right to raise alarm over the UK’s demand for backdoor access to Apple users’ encrypted data,” said Kia Hamadanchy, senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. “While this might be a British government demand, it will have huge consequences for anyone in the U.S. with an iPhone.”",

        "full_text": "LONDON — In almost every way, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will walk into the White House on Thursday as an alien in President Donald Trump’s MAGA universe: a former human rights lawyer, a onetime top prosecutor and, after vanquishing Conservatives in elections last summer, the United Kingdom’s most liberal leader in more than a decade.\n\nStarmer arrives already in the crosshairs of Trump adviser Elon Musk, who has derided him on social media as a warrior of wokeism leading Britain toward inevitable civil war (not to mention being “complicit” in mass pedophilia).\n\nBut Starmer is betting the future of U.S.-U.K. relations on milder first words from Trump himself. The president said last month that he had a good relationship with Starmer and, while they differed on “philosophy,” that the Labour Party leader who took office in July had done “a very good job so far.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich reception he finds, as Trump continues to upend transatlantic relations, will help determine how Britain — and Europe — navigates the insurgent president’s upheavals in trade, disparagement of NATO and abrupt lurch toward Russia in the three-year-old war in Ukraine.\n\n“It’s a pretty defining moment, which Trump he meets and how it goes down,” said a British official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to publicly discuss internal deliberations. “What happens over the next few weeks will determine how Keir is viewed as a world leader and how the relationship evolves.”\n\nStarmer will be battling not just for Britain’s standing in Trump’s Washington, but Europe’s, as well. The prime minister has offered himself as a bridge between the White House and Continental capitals reeling from the president’s threats to unwind four generations of American security backing to such a degree that Germany’s presumptive next chancellor said NATO could be finished in its current form by the summer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike other leaders, Starmer approaches the mercurial Trump by trying to walk a line between agreeable and acquiescent, flattery and fealty.\n\nStarmer told Parliament on Tuesday that his government would fast-track a hike in defense spending to reach 2.5 percent of GDP by 2027 — an additional 13.4 billion pounds, or $17 billion a year, that would put Britain on a path to 3 percent in the coming years, the prime minister said. The spike is in line with Trump’s demand that NATO members spend more on their own defense and rely less on Washington’s military might.\n\nAnd in cutting Britain’s modest foreign aid budget to help fund the military boost, Starmer echoed priorities set by Trump, who spent his first weeks in office dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nOn Ukraine, the prime minister praised the president’s head-spinning about-face in favor of Russia for shaking up the conversation and creating new opportunities for ending the war. He pledged British troops as part of a potential international force sent to help secure a negotiated peace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Starmer shows flashes of defiance. He has insisted that Ukraine and Europe must not be sidelined in talks with Russia and that U.S. backing will be “vital” for any multinational security force. Starmer insists that Ukraine remain a candidate for NATO membership, a possibility ruled off-the-table by Trump’s defense secretary.\n\nAnd Starmer rejected outright Trump’s depiction of Ukraine as the aggressor and President Volodymyr Zelensky as a “dictator,” leading a chorus of support for Zelensky that stretched across Britain’s political spectrum. On Monday, Britain announced more than 100 new sanctions against Russia, its largest wave of injunctions since the early days of the invasion.\n\nStarmer will file into the Oval Office three days after French President Emmanuel Macron. Starmer and Macron, who is driving the push for European countries to commit troops to a Ukraine security force, are coordinating their Trump strategies, aides said.\n\n“Our efforts are convergent, concordant and complementary,” said an Elysée official, speaking on the condition of anonymity in line with French government protocol.\n\nIn Britain, the question is whether Starmer, with a personality more technocratic than colorful, will be able to show flashes of the bro-bonhomie that have enlivened Macron’s up-and-down relations with Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStarmer is known for his methodical, some would say ruthless, rise through the ranks of Labour. Without much in the way of oratory or ideology, he deposed his more liberal boss Jeremy Corbyn and dragged the party to the center. Last year, he ended 14 years of Conservative rule with a relentless focus on delivering competent government and “change.”\n\nRarely does he show strong reactions to the inevitable personal attacks that come with politics, a flatness that may serve him well in dealings with Team Trump.\n\nHe initially waved away Musk’s charge last month that he was “complicit in the rape of Britain” for allegedly failing as a crown prosecutor to investigate immigrant gangs accused of grooming and assaulting girls. Only after the story continued to build did Starmer publicly condemn the charges as “lies” and detail his successful prosecutions against the gangs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Keir is absolutely unflappable, he’s levelheaded,” said Josh Simons, a Labour member of Parliament. “That makes him unusually well suited in terms of his temperament to be a bridge between Trump and Europe.”\n\nThere is a long history of Britain trying — with varying success — to be a conduit between the United States and Europe. Some American and British leaders have hit it off; others less so.\n\nMargaret Thatcher once said that Ronald Reagan was “the second-most important man” in her life after her husband. Barack Obama looked to the continent for his “closest ally,” which is how he described German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nStill, it’s hard to imagine Starmer and Trump sharing the personal chemistry of Tony Blair and Bill Clinton, said Rob Ford, a politics expert at the University of Manchester.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“They aren’t going to ever be golfing buddies,” Ford said. “But that’s not what’s being asked of him. Starmer is the kind of politician who will do whatever it takes in order to win, and winning in this case means having influence with the U.S. and being a bridge with Europe.”\n\nOther transatlantic experts said it would be a mistake to rely on outdated nostalgia for past heydays of a “special relationship” with Washington.\n\nTrump may have more of a soft spot for Britain than Musk does, with the golf courses he owns in Scotland and a known fondness for royal family pomp (an invitation to visit King Charles at Balmoral Castle is already in the works, according to British media reports).\n\nBut Trump’s early actions suggest he is less likely than ever to be flattered off his drive to remake Western alliances, said Tim Bale, a politics professor at Queen Mary University of London. Trump “is going to do what he wants to do, whether Starmer sucks up to him or not.”\n\nEllen Francis in Brussels contributed to this report.",

The website offered no explanation for why it had removed some items or how it had arrived at the higher total. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, sent a written statement that did not address the deletions, but provided a broader defense of the cost-cutting initiative, saying it “has already identified billions of dollars in savings.”\n\nThe “wall of receipts” is the only public ledger the organization has produced to document its work. The scale of that ledger’s errors — and the misunderstandings and poor quality control that seemed to underlie them — has raised questions about the effort’s broader work, which has led to mass firings and cutbacks across the federal government.",

        "full_text": "We’ve been telling ourselves the wrong story about Christianity in the United States.\n\nSince surveys began showing a surge in nonreligious adults in the mid-1990s, many have assumed the Christian population was headed downhill with no brakes.\n\nOrganized religion was out of favor, “none of the above” was in, and houses of worship across the country were too busy dealing with aging congregations and rising building costs to find successful ways to bring new people in.\n\nTo be clear, the U.S. Christian population did indeed shrink over the past 30 years, but a major new religion survey shows the trend line unexpectedly leveled off around 2019.\n\nFor the past five years, the share of U.S. adults who identify as Christian has hovered between 60% and 64%, while the share who identify as unaffiliated has similarly stalled around 29%, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nMany questions remain about whether this recent stabilization is sustainable, but religion scholars say we should be ready for more plot twists.\n\n“I was quite surprised by the data, but in a broader sense, I wasn’t surprised,” said John C. Green, a political scientist at the University of Akron who consulted with Pew on the new study. “I’m always expecting the unexpected. That’s what it means to be in a dynamic religious landscape.”\n\nReligious change in the U.S.\n\nPew’s new Religious Landscape Study offers an in-depth, authoritative look at religion in the U.S.\n\nThink of it like a census focused on faith and spirituality, instead of your household makeup.\n\nThe latest survey, which was fielded in 2023 and 2024, builds on reports from 2007 and 2014. Not all questions from each report can be directly compared, but researchers built a variety of trend lines.\n\nIn summarizing those trends during a Feb. 19 press briefing, Greg Smith, the senior associate director of research at Pew, spoke about two different time periods.\n\nOver the long term, organized religion has experienced a broad-based decline. The Christian share of the population fell from 78% in 2007 to 62% in the new study, while the unaffiliated share surged from 16% to 29% over the same 17-year period.\n\nBut in the short term, the numbers have held pretty steady, especially when compared to data collected from 2007 to 2019.\n\n“After many years of decline, it’s striking … to have observed this recent period of stability,\" said Smith, who worked on all three religious landscape studies.\n\nThe recent stabilization stems from two key factors, according to Smith and other researchers.\n\nFirst, beginning around 2019, religious Americans of all ages stuck with religion at higher rates than expected.\n\nAnd second, young adults born from 2000 to 2006 have turned out to be about as religious as adults born in the 1990s. Researchers had been expecting a notable religious decline from one birth cohort to the next.\n\n“Today’s youngest adults aren’t really less religious than the second youngest cohort and that limits how much the youngest cohort is tugging down on the nation’s overall religiousness,” Smith said.\n\nReligion experts don’t know for sure what caused these two developments, but some believe the COVID-19 pandemic played a role.\n\nAlthough COVID-19 forced temporary church closures, it also prompted congregations to boost their outreach efforts and their use of livestreaming technology.\n\nThose shifts, along with the fact that tragedy often draws people closer to God, likely contributed to the religious landscape’s recent stabilization, Green said.\n\n“The spiritual needs of people went up quite dramatically during the pandemic,” he said. “It could very well be that many people found what organized religion could offer them to be particularly rewarding.”\n\nA lasting change?\n\nPew’s study is focused on the past and present of American religion, but it raises some important questions about the future.\n\nThe data suggests that the share of U.S. adults who identify as religious will begin to trend downward again soon, in part because the highly religious cohort of older Americans will shrink as its members die and in part because younger Americans are not expected to grow more religious as they age.\n\n“If the religiousness of today’s young adults stays the same, and future generations look more like today’s young adults than like today’s older adults, then we’d expected to see a resumption of long-term secularization trends,” Smith said.\n\nSo what could flip the script?\n\nTo keep the trend line stable or even increase the share of Americans who identify as religious, faith groups will need to attract new members.\n\nThat’s easier said than done, but religion experts believe the new Pew study points to some potential strategies.\n\nMost notably, the study identified the broad appeal of spiritual beliefs.\n\nEighty-six percent of U.S. adults believe people have a soul or spirit in addition to a physical body, 83% believe in God or a universal spirit and 79% believe there is something spiritual beyond the natural world, Pew found.\n\n“When asked how their levels of spirituality may have changed over the course of their lifetimes, Americans who say they have become more spiritual outnumber those who say they have become less spiritual by a roughly four-to-one margin (43% vs. 11%),\" researchers wrote.\n\nDuring Pew’s Feb. 19 press briefing, Penny Edgell, a sociologist at the University of Minnesota who consulted on the report, described these figures as “remarkable” and said that religion scholars and others who care about the future of faith need to pay more attention to spiritual beliefs.\n\n“I was trying to think of anything else that 86% of Americans agree on. That’s remarkably high,” she said.\n\nSimilarly, Green said the new data on spirituality presents an opportunity to religious organizations.\n\n“To the extent that religious communities can address spiritual concerns, they may very well draw people back in. If that happens, the pause (in the decline of organized religion) will become a plateau and the plateau may ultimately become growth,” he said.\n\nAnother takeaway from the new study is that faith groups will have to make institution-level adjustments to spur growth, since the power of parents is declining.\n\nAlthough kids raised in religious homes are still much more likely than their peers to become religious adults, the “stickiness” of childhood faith is declining, Smith said.\n\nIn other words, religious children today aren’t as likely to become religious adults as they were in the past.\n\nPolitics and religion\n\nIf Christian congregations don’t find a way to draw in religiously unaffiliated Americans, a couple things will likely happen over the next few decades.\n\nFirst, as already noted, the trend line for U.S. adults who identify as Christians will start moving downward again.\n\nSecond, existing congregations will grow older and more conservative, since politically liberal adults are leaving Christianity at higher rates than politically conservative adults.\n\n“The share of self-described political liberals who identify as Christians has fallen 25 percentage points since 2007, from 62% to 37%. Among self-described conservatives, the Christian share has declined 7 points, from 89% to 82%,” Pew reported.\n\nAlready, faith groups are less politically mixed — and less diverse in general — than they were in the past, Green said.\n\nTo people who see churches as a place where Americans build bridges across lines of difference, that’s a negative development, he noted. But homogeneity may actually help faith groups attract new members in the coming years.\n\n“From the point of view of congregational stability, homogeneity is good because people don’t engage in arguments very much about things beyond the faith,” Green said.\n\nMore progressive congregations, in particular, may benefit from marketing themselves as a place where currently nonreligious — but politically active — liberals can find kindred spirits, Green added.\n\n“One of biggest opportunities for growth would be among people who have more progressive views,” he said.\n\nOther survey takeaways\n\nIf you include the appendixes, Pew’s new report is nearly 400 pages long. It includes much more data on religious beliefs and practices than what’s discussed above.\n\nThe Deseret News will do deeper dives on the report in the coming months. For now, here’s a quick overview of other key takeaways.\n\nThe share of Americans who identify as Protestant has notably declined since 2007, but it’s been relatively stable since 2019 — the same pattern that appears if you look at the data for all Christians. But in recent years, Protestants have been gravitating toward nondenominational churches and away from established denominations, like the United Methodist Church.\n\nTwo percent of respondents to the 2023-24 Religious Landscape Study identified as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. That figure is virtually unchanged since 2007, Pew reported.\n\nThe share of U.S. adults who identify with a non-Christian religious group has been trending upward over the past two decades. In 2007, 4.7% of Americans identified as Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu or part of some other non-Christian faith group. Now, that figure stands at 7.1%.\n\nImmigrants are driving the growth of non-Christian religious groups in the U.S., but that doesn’t mean there are more non-Christian immigrants than Christian immigrants, according to Smith. Fifty-eight percent of U.S. immigrants are Christian, while 14% identify with other religions.\n\nHistorically, American women have been more religiously active than American men. That’s still true today, but the gender gap is small in younger generations. “Among the oldest adults in the new survey (ages 74 and older), the share of women who say they pray every day is 20 points higher than among men. By contrast, among the youngest adults (ages 18 to 24), the share of women who say they pray daily (30%) is similar to the share of men who say they do the same (26%); the 4-point gap is not statistically significant,” Pew reported.\n\nTo dive into the data yourself, check out the full survey report and the accompanying interactive website.\n\nPew’s methodology\n\nThe 2023-24 Religious Landscape Study was conducted from July 17, 2023, to March 4, 2024, in English and Spanish.\n\nPew used address-based sampling to create its nationally representative sample of 36,908 U.S. adults.\n\nMost participants took the survey online, but they had the option of participating via paper form or phone conversation.\n\nThe 2007 and 2014 studies, on the other hand, were administered entirely by phone.\n\nThe “mode change” in 2023-24 explains why researchers weren’t always comfortable making direct comparisons between the earlier studies and the new data, according to Alan Cooperman, Pew’s director of religion research.\n\nThe margin of error for the full sample in 2023-24 is plus or minus 0.8 percentage points.",

        "full_text": "Newsom is hardly the first politician to have his own podcast platform. But in an interview with POLITICO Tuesday, he pointed to aspects he believes differentiate it from the typical gabfest: He’s an officeholder booking guests he vehemently disagrees with — occasionally to spar, but with the goal of building out a forum that illuminates their respective positions.\n\n“We already know what our disagreements are with the MAGA movement. I want to understand what the motivations are, the legitimacy of those motivations, and just really understand where people are coming from,” Newsom said. “They are influential — they are. They explain more things in more ways on more days about what’s going on and if we’re not trying to understand their motivations, we will be victims of their motivations.”\n\nNewsom, a student of the right-wing ecosystem who is both fascinated and distressed by its ability to elevate subjects into the mainstream, mentioned his regular appearances on Fox News, Newsmax and other conservative outlets. He debated Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in late 2023, moderated by Fox’s Sean Hannity, who remains in regular touch with Newsom. He ran a series of TV ads in red states over the last two years calling attention to their anti-abortion laws.\n\nBut his show, premiering in the coming weeks, won’t be confined to crashing the ascendent right-wing.\n\n“At the same time, I want Democrats to come on and sort of challenge where we are on a lot of these issues,” Newsom said. “And so I’m asking the same questions you’re asking of me: Where the hell is the Democratic Party? What are we doing? Who are we? Where are we going? What’s the path back? I’m having the exact same conversations, and I just thought it’d be a hell of a lot more interesting to do it publicly and to do it as honestly as I can.”\n\nReferring to his podcast host persona as “practitioner, not pundit,” Newsom said he wants to give conversations from the show immediate relevance by taking some from concept to action, including new policy approaches and ways he can try to better connect with Californians.\n\n“I’m here to stress test positions, including my own, in a more transparent manner,” he added. “It’s not a place everyone comes for therapy. I’m not looking to just give the orthodoxy — progressive and liberal talking points. There are so many outstanding people doing that, like our gifted professionals. I add no value in that space. I’m a redundant voice … But what I think I can offer is as a practitioner — not an ideologue, not a pundit: I’m in it as much or more than most elected officials in this country, because I’m in the largest state. I’m in a state that’s deeply on the mind of the administration. I’m in a state that is profoundly critical to the fate and future as it relates to some of the most critical industries like artificial intelligence, and obviously in this remarkable moment as it relates to geopolitical re-calibration.”\n\nNewsom has largely resisted offering a fulsome postmortem after his party’s miserable 2024 election, though he said the notebook he’s jotted ideas in has grown from eight handwritten pages to 28 as more numerical and anecdotal data emerges. His approach on the podcast recalls the Newsom of early 2022, who grew increasingly exasperated about the lack of aggressiveness to confront resurgent Republicans in the national culture wars. Ultimately, he rallied behind the party’s leaders and became a top surrogate for former President Joe Biden.\n\nNewsom said his goal isn’t to circumvent the news media but to take advantage of his position and deep contact list “to engage, promote and explore dialogue.” He counts comedian Bill Maher’s HBO program and podcast as creative inspiration for his new program, contending the host finds common ground with adversaries while taking frequent aim at Democratic dogma.\n\n“I watch him because I appreciate how he calls balls and strikes — takes shots at both parties,” said Newsom, a regular guest of Maher’s “Real Time.” “He has a broader value set that is more aligned with mine, but he doesn’t have a problem in suffering fools on either side of the aisle.”\n\nSam Griffel, who has worked closely with Newsom as a producer on the iHeart podcasts, said his latest effort has an underlying imperative: make sure it’s digestible and authentic, not inaccessible and canned.\n\n“We as a society are good at sniffing out that type of BS,” he said. “So for me, the more we’re willing to be pushing into areas of discomfort for our guests and hosts the more real it will be.”\n\nAsked if guests — particularly Democrats who see the world similarly to him — will be as candid on the podcast as they are in private texts and calls with him, Newsom conceded, “that ultimately will be determinative if this is interesting or not.”\n\nNewsom declined to name the half-dozen guests he said have privately agreed to come on with him. “I don’t want to lose these folks by letting their names out there,” he said. But he gave a big hint: ”Look at the lineup at CPAC.”\n\n“It’s that crew. These are the guys right now who are enjoying their status, they’re enjoying their moment, and they’re having not just a moment here, but around the world. And we want to explore that,” he said.\n\nThe Conservative Political Action Conference’s recent straw poll identified Newsom and Sen. Adam Schiff as the two Democrats who pose the greatest threat to the U.S. and the GOP.\n\nNewsom is no stranger to his own broadcasts. As lieutenant governor, he hosted the weekly “Gavin Newsom Show,” which briefly ran on San Francisco-based Current TV and featured interviews with guests from Hollywood and Silicon Valley including the then lesser-known tech entrepreneur Elon Musk. A literary memoir he wrote was scheduled for release on May 13, but has been delayed until at least the fall.\n\nNewsom starts his new venture at the top of a crowded two years in his final term. He’s facing state budget pressures, a hostile federal government and an immense rebuilding effort after the most expensive disaster in U.S. history.\n\nWhile he didn’t spend time focusing his remarks about the new podcast on specific challenges he faces in his last months in office, it will broaden his platform to push back on misinformation he encountered during the wildfires that tore through Los Angeles last month.\n\nThe governor, a natural political pugilist, has largely been reluctant of late to take shots at Trump as he works to appeal to the president for federal disaster aid. Newsom believes that Democrats like himself can have more of an impact by zeroing in on key actions he finds especially detestable like deep cuts to Medicaid.\n\n“Those become the dominant moments, from my perspective, where we need to align and be more aggressive,” he said. “People are pushing back. Republicans are now starting to wake up. I think we’ve moved from resignation to now more and more resistance. I think that’s very positive. The question then becomes, how do you strategically do that?”\n\nHis word of the year to describe the Trump administration, as he put it, is “betrayal.”\n\n“Fire and fury. What does it signify? Something or nothing?” Newsom asked about the early actions from Washington, allowing that the Musk-led government cuts have added to peoples’ anxiety. “If it signifies something, you got to call that out. And that’s the ‘betrayal.’”\n\nBut equally on his radar is Democrats not being overly reactive and instead taking matters into their own hands.\n\n“How do we break through? Are we just reacting to noise with more noise? Are we more strategic this time, and are we going to pierce the consciousness, not just of our base, they’re already with us, but those that we need to bring back?” he asked, describing those and the other questions he posed in the interview as central themes of the podcast project.\n\nDespite constant criticism from the right, Newsom said he’s not overly worried about giving certain MAGA personalities a platform, though when asked about the conspiracist Alex Jones, he said some characters were likely a bridge too far.\n\nInstead, if anything, he said Democrats have avoided or outright ignored the right at their own peril, and praised former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg’s “go-everywhere, talk-to-everyone” strategy that calls for calmly confronting opponents on their own turf.\n\n“I think the biggest mistake we’ve made is staying in the warm embrace of our ideological lane. And it didn’t work out for us. We are sitting here on the sidelines right now trying to figure out how to get back in the game,” Newsom said.",

        "full_text": "Hochul has begun publicly positioning herself as a major Democratic opponent of President Donald Trump, clashing with him last week over his intervention to kill New York City’s controversial congestion pricing plan. She trolled the president again on Tuesday, flipping Trump’s famous catchphrase to attract workers laid off by Elon Musk’s DOGE.\n\n“The federal government might say, ‘You’re fired,’ but here in New York, we say, ‘You’re hired.’ In fact, we love federal workers,” Hochul said in a video statement on X. “Whatever your skills, we value public service. Check out potential jobs at ny.gov/wewantyou. Come join our New York State family.”\n\nNew York State Department of Civil Service Commissioner and Civil Service Commission President Timothy R. Hogues elaborated on Hochul’s call, saying the state is seeking the “best and brightest” to take up the “noble calling” of public service.\n\n“Under Governor Hochul’s leadership, we have been working hard to retain and recruit the next generation of employees and servant-leaders. By coming to work for the Empire State, you’ll have the opportunity to help your neighbors, community and state in a variety of ways — serving, protecting, and caring for your fellow New Yorkers and our wonderful resources in solid, stable jobs,” he said in a statement obtained by ABC 7 News.\n\nHochul isn’t the only one who has sought to tap into the skills of newly laid-off federal workers. Trump ally Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) expressed sympathy for the over 10,000 federal workers laid off by DOGE, urging them to take advantage of the Virginia job market.\n\n“Today, Virginia stands as the top state for business, with tremendous job opportunities across the Commonwealth. ‘Virginia Has Jobs’ is an opportunity for every Virginian — and every business — to capitalize on the thriving economy, with more than 250,000 open jobs waiting to be filled,” Youngkin said.\n\nThe governor added that Virginia was there to help and support the recently unemployed workers.\n\n“I want to reiterate that if you are in our federal workforce. We care about you. We want to support you. We want to make sure that if you experience any job interruption or changes, that you know where to go to get support infrastructure to find that next great opportunity with one of these fabulous employers,” Youngkin said.\n\nYoungkin’s offer would be easier for many, as 145,000, 6.3% of all federal workers, reside in Virginia.\n\nLed by Musk, DOGE has aimed to slash government spending by cutting programs and shrinking the federal workforce. The effort has come under fierce criticism from elected Democrats, highlighting individual cases of workers laid off by the department.\n\nHochul’s trolling of Trump regarding the laid-off federal workers is her latest move in a public campaign against the native New Yorker. The usually reserved governor adopted a stark change in tone on Wednesday in response to the Department of Transportation’s intervention regarding congestion pricing.\n\n“I’m here to say: New York hasn’t labored under a king in over 250 years,” she said to cheers. “We sure as hell are not going to start now.”\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nGoing beyond congestion pricing, Hochul said the problem was secondary and that Trump’s move represented “an attack on our sovereign identity, our independence from Washington.”\n\n“We are not subservient to a king or anyone else out of Washington,” she said. “So this is the fight we’re in. We’re fighting for our residents, our commuters, our riders, our drivers, our emergency personnel.”",

Share Copy Link ✓ Link copied to clipboard! Millions of Social Security recipients impacted by the Social Security Fairness Act will no longer have to wait up to a year for their benefits to increase, the Social Security Administration (SSA) has announced. Why It Matters Earlier this year, lawmakers passed a bill that would repeal the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO). Both of these reduced Social Security benefits for millions of workers, including teachers, firefighters, and police officers, and some federal employees. Signing the act into law, former President Joe Biden said it would permanently boost Social Security benefits for more than 2.8 million recipients, and that retroactive payments backdated to January 2024 would also be issued. But these groups were told that it could take up to a year for backdated payments and renewed benefits amounts to be administered. What To Know The WEP reduced Social Security benefits for individuals who receive pensions from public-sector jobs—such as those held by state and federal employees—that did not require Social Security payroll tax contributions. This reduction applied even if they contributed to Social Security through other employment and qualified for benefits. The GPO reduced spousal or survivor benefits for retired federal, state, and local government workers who did not pay into Social Security funds through their payroll taxes.

GETTY Now, the SSA has confirmed that impacted groups, consisting of some 3.2 million people, will receive a one-time retroactive payment by the end of March . Higher benefits—which former President Biden said would be an average $360 a month—will be administered from April onward. The SSA has said that, \"depending on factors such as the type of Social Security benefit received and the amount of the person's pension, the change in payment amount will vary from person to person.\" The federal agency added that impacted recipients \"will receive a mailed notice from Social Security explaining the benefit change or retroactive payment.\" Why Were Payments Delayed? On its website, the SSA said it was \"finalizing its plan to implement the act while limiting negative effects on our regular workloads and services to the public.\" However, the implementation of the Act is being hampered by a hiring freeze and \"ongoing staff shortages,\" the SSA said. The administration added that it expected it \"could take more than one year to adjust benefits and pay all retroactive benefits.\" What People Are Saying Lee Dudek, acting commissioner of Social Security, said in a press release issued on February 25 : \"Social Security's aggressive schedule to start issuing retroactive payments in February and increase monthly benefit payments beginning in April supports President Trump's priority to implement the Social Security Fairness Act as quickly as possible. \"The agency's original estimate of taking a year or more now will only apply to complex cases that cannot be processed by automation. The American people deserve to get their due benefits as quickly as possible.\" John Hatton, staff vice president of policy and programs at National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, told Federal News Network : \"SSA's announcement that they will begin paying benefits to those impacted by WEP and GPO this week is music to our ears. This is much quicker than previously forecast, and will have an immediate, positive impact on those who have waiting decades for this relief.\" What Happens Next With payments expected to arriving over the next two months, the SSA has urged beneficiaries to wait until April to ask about the status of their retroactive payment since these payments will be processed incrementally into March. As for increased monthly payments, new amounts will be distributed starting in April's payment, so beneficiaries should wait until after receiving it before contacting Social Security if they have any queries about their monthly benefit amount. fairness meter fairness meter Newsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.

        "full_text": "In United States Vice President JD Vance’s February 14th speech at the Munich Security Conference, he criticized Romania's annulment of its presidential election held in December and spoke to several large issues facing Europe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Romanian government nullified the election results on \"flimsy suspicions of an intelligence agency and enormous pressure from its continental neighbors,” remarked Vance.\n\nThe new presidential vote is planned for May 4, with a possible run-off vote scheduled for May 18.\n\nThe vice president also took the opportunity to call out European Union \"commissars\" for suppressing free speech, failing to address mass migration, and retreating from \"some of its most fundamental values.” He then implored Europe to step up as President Trump works to find an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nFollowing Vice President Vance’s speech, former Prime Minister and current member of the Chamber of Deputies Victor Ponta spoke to Townhall Media.\n\nTownhall Media: Thank you, sir. Before we get to the vice president's speech in Munich, can you clear up speculation or say something more on the reports that you are \"determined\" to enter the presidential race?\n\nVictor Ponta: Now, I can be very clear. Yes, I will run, and yes, I will be the president of Romania.\n\nTownhall Media: During the vice president’s speech, he questioned the annulment of last year’s Romanian election due to alleged Russian interference, implying that such actions undermine democratic resilience. Given these assertions, how do you perceive Romania’s position within the broader U.S.-Europe relationship? Should Romania align more closely with U.S. perspectives on governance and free speech, or maintain its current trajectory within the European framework?\n\nVictor Ponta: Ever since we threw away the shackles of communism, Romania and its people have committed to a special partnership with the U.S. As prime minister of Romania ten years ago, I had to take strategic decisions that proved this. For example, to buy for the Romanian Airforce F16 jets, to release the first licences for shale gas and offshore gas to Chevron and Exxon. We hold the second-largest American military base on the continent.\n\nBut now, with the new administration led by President Trump, the enthusiasm of Romanians about America is even greater. The absolute majority of Romanians are sharing the values promoted by the MAGA movement: God, family, country, peace. Mr. Trump is very popular in my country.\n\nRomania will always be in Europe and a proud member of the EU, but when I’m elected as president, I will advocate for more alignment with the U.S. There is no NATO without the U.S., and there is no reliable military or energetic security for the continent without the U.S. As president of Romania, I would come immediately to the Trump administration with a clear common project to make Mihail Kogalniceanu Air Base (MKAB) in Romania, the largest U.S. base in Europe, and another economic project to develop with American companies in the field of huge natural resources which are already confirmed in the Black sea and the Carpathian areas.\n\nRomanian people are disappointed by the bureaucracy and lack of transparency in Brussels, as we witnessed during the COVID pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Most of all, the shameful decision to cancel the second round of elections in our country without evidence or reasonable cause – and without any pushback from Europe. And so, besides military and economic cooperation, I strongly believe that only the U.S. can guarantee for Romania a clear and sustainable return to free speech and democratic elections. The people of Romania must have a voice and be allowed to vote for whomever they want, and I greatly welcome the new administration’s firm stance on that issue.\n\nTownhall Media: Reflecting some more on last year’s cancelled elections, what measures would you propose to strengthen Romania’s electoral integrity? How can Romania balance the need for security with the preservation of democratic processes and public trust?\n\nVictor Ponta: The first thing we have to do is transfer the power back to the people. We have a ridiculous situation where the banning of candidates or annulling elections is completely in the hands of a few judges without any oversight or participation of parliament. The ultimate sovereign is completely shut out. When I was PM, it was different. But after I left office, it was changed into a non-transparent and undemocratic way. The system in Romania is stronger than the people’s will, and this is the greatest cause of anger and distrust.\n\nThe core values of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of elections, where the people are the sovereign, have been lost, taken hostage in the last ten years by a system that serves its own interests – God forbid even foreign interests – and not the Romanian people. Only in very, very extreme cases do security interests need to outweigh democratic ones – and that principle has been lost in Romania.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI saw that system from very close when I was prime minister 10 years ago. I started to fight it by reforming old economic structures and creating a powerful and free economy. People had more money in their pockets and more freedom back then. But the system manipulated my elections for president and even killed people to force me out of office. They continued to chase me, tried to prosecute me and imprison me, and I had to fight for my innocence, just like Mr. Trump.\n\nI made my mistakes but now I come back smarter and stronger. The system cannot threaten me anymore, and I know its weaknesses. I know I have a strong backing from the new U.S. administration, and I’m going to push new reforms to release both the Romanian economy and Romanian democracy because our people deserve to live better. It’s time for the Romanian people to become the first priority and have the system to bow to the sovereign.\n\nTownhall Media: The other weekend, Americans were seeing images on TV of German police arresting people in their homes for social media posts around Europe. Vice President Vance highlighted his concerns about censorship and the suppression of dissent within European countries. What is your stance on these issues within Romania? How would your administration ensure the protection of free speech and political diversity, while safeguarding national security?\n\nVictor Ponta: I can guarantee one thing for sure – when I’m president, no one in Romania will be arrested for social media posts unless there is a clear and present danger that the person is about to commit a serious and violent crime, like in the form of terrorism.\n\nThe rules and atmosphere of public discussion have changed and we must adapt. Things that were forbidden to say a few decades ago are mainstream today. I am totally disgusted by a culture of cancel where certain views are not allowed to be expressed. Limiting free speech is not the answer – open debate is. We cannot close ourselves and listen only to the ones who have a similar opinion to ours.\n\nTownhall Media: With President Trump’s return to office, there appears to be a shift in U.S. foreign policy – emphasizing support for conservative values and a reevaluation of traditional alliances. A recent poll of Romanians had 62% believing that President Trump’s election was good for Romanians. How do you envision Romania navigating its relationship with the U.S. under this administration? What opportunities or challenges do you foresee arising from this renewed U.S. leadership?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVictor Ponta: The trends in America resemble those in Romania. In these times of uncertainties, we begin to realize how important tradition and faith are as a sense of stability, comfort, and guidance. Romanians didn’t lose their faith in God during the years of communism, and now more and more people return to the churches and monasteries that were a great part of our tradition and values.\n\nThere is a side in Europe that is more traditional. Countries like Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Italy present a different attitude towards the North Atlantic relationship than France or Netherlands. We want closer ties with the U.S, and closer economic ties – built on reciprocity and fairness. Romania needs to contribute more to security because that is the only way to secure peace. Europe, without the U.S., is vulnerable, and we must understand that this is a partnership where everyone must feel satisfied. If America thinks it is treated unfairly in terms of trade, we must solve those issues together.\n\nThe problem is that, today, the voice of Romania is absent. We are not a small country in the EU but our leadership behaves as a vassal state with no opinion or contribution. We must have our place at the table and make sure that Romania’s interests are fulfilled. When I was prime minister, Romania was growing fast and was attractive to investments from U.S. companies. Now our economy is headed for stagflation, and no one wants to come. Growth is weak and prices are soaring, because our economy is practically managed by an old, self-serving, corrupt system using economic methods that didn’t even work in the 20th century, let alone in the 21st.\n\nI know how to change this, and the only way is by flipping the system on its head; by cutting down on bloated public administration, cutting down on taxes, using our own resources for energy independence, opening the system for more competition, encouraging consumption, and supporting Romanian small businesses. Just like what is done now by the Trump administration in the U.S.\n\nTownhall Media: You were prime minister of Romania from 2013-2015, and it was thought you were leaving politics at the end of 2020. Then you ran and won a seat in parliament in December. What made you get back into the arena?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVictor Ponta: When I was PM ten years ago, the economy was soaring. We cut taxes and encouraged investments and results soon followed. The money flowed to people’s pockets, and I had even bigger and better plans.\n\nThe system didn’t like it. They manipulated the elections, and – I dare to say – even caused peoples’ deaths in order to turn the people against me and stop me. I couldn’t fight the system and the people at the same time. When I resigned, taking responsibility for things not directly under my control, I said I will always be on the side of the people. I thought others might come in my place and have the opportunity to continue the progress. Instead, the politicians who took control only thought about themselves, gave up on Romania’s interests, and brought our country to misery and almost bankruptcy.\n\nThe last straw was the cancelling of the elections. I understood that the system also wants to take away the people’s voice and that I can no longer remain on the fence. Otherwise, we will really lose everything. We have reached the point of now or never. It is not only shameful and undemocratic but also dangerous. This is the place where democracy ends and tyranny starts.\n\nI want to give people back their voice and their right to choose. I want to give people a sense of control over the system. There is a way to change the system – America has shown us how. And I want to bring the sense of fairness and prosperity back to our people. I have learned from my mistakes and am coming back even more determined to flip the system on its head. I want to put Romanian people in the first place.\n\nTownhall Media: The Trump administration has been critical of the European Union’s bureaucracy and regulatory overreach. How would a pro-Trump Romanian presidency challenge or reform EU policies to make them more favorable to stronger borders, less centralized governance, and greater national autonomy within the Union?\n\nVictor Ponta: The first thing we have to do is look at ourselves. The system in Romania is bloated and inefficient, and that puts a heavy burden on our growth. One of the goals of my project for Romania 2030 is to have an efficient, professional government with a reduced administration. I would like to cut 20% of the Romanian administration workforce across the board, sparing those with direct contact with citizens, like teachers, doctors, and nurses. Such a measure would weed out inefficiency and waste, and allow us to raise salaries for those remaining – thus attracting better people. Citizens are tired of government offices that only serve themselves and a system that doesn’t care about them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTownhall Media: It is often said that a man is measured by the enemies he makes – who are the forces that don’t want you running? What do you say to Romanians who might be undecided?\n\nVictor Ponta: The interference in elections didn’t start today but already existed back when I ran for president 11 years ago. The system used all its powers to manipulate the elections in a very unfair way. After I lost, they didn’t stop. They were afraid of me returning to power and orchestrated the legal system against me. I had to face several bogus charges that eventually were dismissed.\n\nI thank God I was able in the last few years to build my independent business – not connected to anything in Romania. I am totally free from the system, and they cannot threaten me anymore. It is not to say they are not trying. I am getting hints and messages that show me that I am still very much feared by very powerful groups in the Romanian state. In the years since I left office, the system only got stronger, more arrogant, and more determined.\n\nFortunately, today I am more experienced and smarter. I know exactly the weaknesses of the system and how to counter it. I am much more determined than before because I know it is now or never. If the system can get away with cancelling the elections and blocking people’s voices then we are headed for doom. In these elections, I ask voters to consider who has a plan to transfer power from the system to the people, and who already has experience in making Romanians – and not the system – wealthier and more prosperous. We have a resourceful and rich country, and our citizens should be the first ones to benefit and enjoy this. Romanians should feel they are in the first place, not some self-serving system beholden by corruption and foreign interests.\n\nTownhall Media: Thank you. As we wrap up, what would you like to say to the average American citizen who may not typically pay attention to Romanian politics from 5,000-6,000 miles away?\n\nVictor Ponta: I want to say to all Americans that Romania and Europe are your allies in making a world where the values of democracy and freedom of speech are paramount. I want to say that the U.S. and Romania have lots of economic opportunities to discuss, and we are open to American companies and investors. And I want to say that Romania is one of the most, if not the most, beautiful countries in Europe, with ancient traditions and mysteries – like the home of Count Dracula – and I invite and welcome American tourists to come and explore and enjoy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThank you.\n\n*This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.",

        "full_text": "Eli Lilly on Wednesday said it will invest at least $27 billion to build four new manufacturing sites in the U.S., as demand for its blockbuster weight loss and diabetes injections soars and the company develops new drugs for other conditions.\n\nIt comes as drugmakers and companies across different industries work to build goodwill with President Donald Trump, who has emphasized reshoring manufacturing to the U.S. and reducing reliance on foreign supply chains. He has threatened companies — and pharmaceutical businesses in particular — with tariffs if they do not manufacture products in the U.S.\n\nEli Lilly made the announcement at an event in Washington, D.C. — emphasizing the political undertones of the strategy. The event featured several speakers from the Trump administration, including Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who explicitly tied the announcement to Trump's policies.\n\nLutnick said the investment is \"exactly what the Trump administration is all about, which is building and manufacturing and reshoring in America, investing in America, building in America.\" He thanked Eli Lilly for \"doing exactly what the president was hoping would happen.\"\n\nLutnick added that \"if you want to understand the tariff policy\" of the U.S., \"I have just articulated it.\"\n\nThe move brings Eli Lilly's total U.S. manufacturing investments to more than $50 billion in recent years. The other $23 billion is from the company's investments in new plants and site expansions since 2020, which has helped ease supply shortages of its popular drugs.\n\n\"This represents the largest pharmaceutical expansion investment in U.S. history,\" Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said at the event. \"We're making these investments ... to prepare for the demand we anticipate for future pipeline medicines across our therapeutic areas.\"\n\nShares of the company closed more than 1% higher on Wednesday.\n\nThree of the future U.S. sites announced Wednesday will manufacture active ingredients in medications, such as tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly's obesity drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro. Ricks noted that there is a \"real gap in supply chain in the U.S. as it relates to active ingredient availability in our country.\"\n\nThe fourth site will extend the company's global manufacturing network for future injectable therapies, he added.\n\nEli Lilly has not decided on where the four new U.S. sites will be located, Ricks said. The company will be accepting location submissions through March 13 and will announce decisions on new sites in the coming months.\n\nEli Lilly said the four new sites will create more than 3,000 jobs for workers such as engineers and scientists, along with 10,000 construction jobs as the plants are built. The company's other U.S. plants include sites in North Carolina, Indiana and Wisconsin.\n\nThe new investments aren't solely dedicated to Eli Lilly's current and future obesity and diabetes treatments. The company is charting its future beyond Zepbound and Mounjaro, with hopes to deliver drugs from its broad pipeline of products for cancer, Alzheimer's disease and other conditions.\n\nRicks said the company is optimistic about its pipeline across therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic health, oncology, immunology and neuroscience.\n\nStill, the new investments build on the success of Zepbound and Mounjaro, which share dominance of the booming market for so-called GLP-1 drugs with Novo Nordisk 's weight loss drug Wegovy and diabetes treatment Ozempic. Some analysts expect the global obesity drug market to be worth more than $150 billion annually by the early 2030s, making it critical for both companies to maintain their share as other drugmakers scramble to join.\n\nDuring the event, Ricks took a shot at cheaper compounded versions of its injectable drugs, saying \"America faces a growing threat from an influx of counterfeit and compounded medications.\"\n\nEli Lilly's efforts to boost the supply of Zepbound and Mounjaro aim to ensure that eligible patients are safely accessing those branded treatments instead of cheaper compounded versions. Patients flocked to those unapproved copycats when the branded drugs were in short supply, or if they didn't have insurance coverage for the costly treatments.\n\nThe FDA has since declared the shortage of tirzepatide over, which will essentially bar many compounding pharmacies from making copycats.\n\nHassett said the issue also \"disturbs the White House\" because offshore producers of copycat drugs are \"threatening lives in the U.S.\"",

        "full_text": "Organic farmers and environmental groups sued the Agriculture Department on Monday over its scrubbing of references to climate change from its website.\n\nThe department had ordered staff to take down pages focused on climate change on Jan. 30, according to the suit, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Within hours, it said, information started disappearing.\n\nThat included websites containing data sets, interactive tools and funding information that farmers and researchers relied on for planning and adaptation projects, according to the lawsuit.\n\nAt the same time, the department also froze funding that had been promised to businesses and nonprofits through conservation and climate programs. The purge then “removed critical information about these programs from the public record, denying farmers access to resources they need to advocate for funds they are owed,” it said.\n\nThe Agriculture Department referred questions about the lawsuit to the Justice Department, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe suit was filed by lawyers from Earthjustice, based in San Francisco, and the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, on behalf of the Northeast Organic Farming Association of New York, based in Binghamton; the Natural Resources Defense Council, based in New York; and the Environmental Working Group, based in Washington. The latter two groups relied on the department website for their research and advocacy, the lawsuit said.\n\nPeter Lehner, a lawyer for Earthjustice, said the pages being purged were crucial for farmers facing risks linked to climate change, including heat waves, droughts, floods, extreme weather and wildfires. The websites had contained information about how to mitigate dangers and adopt new agricultural techniques and strategies. Long-term weather data and trends are valuable in the agriculture industry for planning, research and business strategy.\n\n“You can purge a website of the words climate change, but that doesn’t mean climate change goes away,” Mr. Lehner said.\n\nThe sites under the department’s umbrella include those of the Forest Service, which is responsible for stewardship of forests and grasslands; the Natural Resources Conservation Service, which helps landowners implement conservation practices; and those of other divisions focused on farms and ranches, disaster recovery and rural development.\n\nThe directive to delete the pages came by email from Peter Rhee, the department’s director of digital communications, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege the actions violated three federal laws and were “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” They asked the court to compel the agency to restore the pages and to block it from deleting any others.\n\nWes Gillingham, president of the board of Northeast Organic Farming Association of New York, said that farmers were just heading into planning for the summer growing season. He said taking information down because of a “political agenda about climate change” was senseless.\n\nMr. Gillingham said his organization is the largest organic certifier in New York State, which is a major hub for small farms. They often send farmers to the Agriculture Department website for information on things like conservation programs and which agricultural practices qualify for grants and loans. They also direct people to resources like equipment lending.\n\n“Right now, because of climate change and because of what farmers are facing in terms of extreme weather events, we need every piece of available information we can get,” he said. “We don’t have access to that, we’re not going to make it.”",

        "full_text": "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has given all intelligence agencies until Friday to identify the employees participating in pornographic chats while on duty, revoke their security clearances, and terminate their employment. In a memo released Tuesday evening, Gabbard responded decisively to revelations that numerous employees who were members of a National Security Agency chat system used it to discuss fetishes, kink, and sex as part of the agency's DEI program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis story broke yesterday (see EXPOSED: NSA, CIA, FBI, and Others Used Government Resources to Do Absolutely Deranged, Disgusting Things – RedState and NSA, CIA Respond to Reports of Concerning Chats in Federal Messaging System – RedState) with the revelation that what seemed to be transgender members of the Intelligence Community representing several intelligence agencies had essentially hijacked two channels on the secure Intelink messaging platform, which helpfully reminds users:\n\nThis is a United States Government computer system. This computer system, including all related equipment, networks, and network devices, including Internet access, are provided only for authorized U.S. Government use. U.S. Government computer systems may be monitored for all lawful purposes, including ensuring that their use is authorized, for management of the system, to facilitate protection against unauthorized access, and to verify security procedures, survivability, and operational security. Monitoring includes authorized attacks by authorized U.S. Government entities to test or verify the security of this system. During monitoring, information may be examined, recorded, copied, and used for authorized purposes. All information including personal information, placed on or sent over this system may be monitored.\n\nUse of this U.S. Government system, authorized or unauthorized, constitutes consent to monitoring of this system. Unauthorized use may subject you to criminal prosecution. Evidence of unauthorized use collected during monitoring may be used for administrative, criminal or other adverse actions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe two channels were called LBTQA and IC_Pride_TWG, which were affiliated with LGBTQ+ “employee resource groups” and promoted by agency leadership.\n\nIn this case, “diversity” was not a byword for racialism, but rather a euphemism for sex talk. Last January, chatroom members discussed their practice of polyamory, or “ethical non-monogamy.” “[A] polycule is a polyamorous group,” one employee explained. “A is my [girlfriend], and B-G are her partners. . . . then B&C are dating but not C&D, nor E, F, or G with any of the others, though there are several MWB (metas-with-benefits) connections.” Another employee claimed to be part of a nine-member “polycule,” adding that “some of our friends are practically poly-mers, with all the connected compounds.”\n\nAt other times, the conversations became explicit. The active source at the NSA claimed to have witnessed hundreds of sexually provocative discussions, which, he added, occurred mostly on taxpayer time. The former NSA source who was familiar with the chats recalled being “disgusted” by a particularly shocking thread discussing weekend “gangbangs.”\n\nThe NSA sources also raised the question of some staffers’ mental fitness for the job. In one chat, an NSA employee insists on using “it” pronouns in lieu of the human “he” or “she” pronouns. “[I]t/its user here. While I understand we can make some people uncomfortable, keep in mind that the dehumanizing aspect either a) doesn’t apply or b) is a positive effect when we’re requesting it.” A commenter who disagreed was quickly dismissed by employees of the NSA and CIA, who claimed that refusing to use “it/its” pronouns amounted to “erasing” a transgender identity.\n\n“These are folks with top secret clearances believing they are an IT!” said the NSA source.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe conversations became highly politicized as well as sexually grotesque as Inauguration Day approached, and Gabbard became a target of criticism.",

        "full_text": "The White House provided an answer to a question Tuesday that had been swirling around Elon Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service for days: Who, officially, is in charge?\n\nA White House official said the DOGE administrator is Amy Gleason, a former health-care executive who worked for the agency in a previous iteration. Now Gleason is positioned, at least on paper, to oversee a massive effort to reshape the federal government that has become synonymous with Musk.\n\nThe disclosure comes just days after the director of the White House Office of Administration sparked confusion by declaring in a court filing that Musk, the special government employee whom President Donald Trump said in November would lead the cost-cutting group, has “no actual or formal authority” over government decisions. Moreover, the filing said Musk “is not the U.S. DOGE Service Administrator,” the position outlined in the executive order establishing the U.S. DOGE Service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGleason is former chief product officer at Russell Street Ventures, the firm founded by health-care entrepreneur and DOGE adviser Brad Smith, according to her LinkedIn profile. Before that she worked for the U.S. Digital Service, the U.S. DOGE Service’s predecessor agency, during Trump’s first term.\n\nAt the USDS “she led the creation of the national covid database and products that used that data to drive the federal response,” an online bio for a speaking opportunity reads.\n\nFriends and former colleagues of Gleason described her as a trained nurse who worked to design electronic medical records, motivated in part by her daughter’s struggle with an autoimmune disease. The Obama administration in 2015 honored those efforts, calling her a “champion of change.” She later joined the U.S. Digital Service during the Trump administration, where she worked on the nation’s coronavirus response. Smith, the health-care entrepreneur who helped oversee the Trump administration’s efforts to fight the pandemic, then hired Gleason in senior roles at his firms. Smith is now helping oversee DOGE’s operations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Amy is a world-class talent, inspired by her personal journey with the health system to make it better for everyone,” said Aneesh Chopra, who served as the Obama administration’s chief technology officer and has worked with Gleason on several health-care initiatives, such as an effort called “Blue Button” to make Medicare data available to patients.\n\n“In product terms, she knows how to ‘ship’ digital services and was quickly tapped to manage the seemingly insurmountable challenge of building a real time map of health capacity during the pandemic,” said Chopra in a written message. “Whatever Amy’s role is at DOGE (USDS), leaders like her should instill greater confidence that the work will benefit the American people. I remain in the camp that more effective and efficient government is — and should remain — a bipartisan endeavor.”\n\nGleason has spoken about her family’s challenges of trying to navigate the complexities of the U.S. health system, arguing that the federal government has the power to cut through bureaucracy and red tape. “One thing that I’ve learned about joining the government is you get to work on really cool problems that affect all of Americans,” Gleason said in a YouTube video posted in 2020, touting her efforts to increase access to Medicare data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I’ve enjoyed knowing her professionally,” said Laurie Smith, a longtime health-care executive who worked with Gleason years ago on a proposal for a government health-care innovation effort. “She is action-oriented and practical.”\n\nGleason’s appointment is unlikely to change any perception that Musk is in charge of DOGE, but it answers a key question as to its organizational structure.\n\nStaffers at the U.S. DOGE Service said Gleason addressed them this month, as part of an effort to bring the former U.S. Digital Service staff into the fold at DOGE, though they were unaware of her title at the time.",

        "full_text": "The report, “Management Advisory: Army’s Future Soldier Preparatory Course Places Trainees At Increased Risk of Adverse Health Effects,” found that recruiters and leadership at the Army Training Center and Fort Jackson admitted recruits with body fat percentages that did not comply with the military branch’s physical fitness requirements and standards. According to the report, 14% of the recruits admitted between February and May 2024 who became trainees in the Army’s Future Soldier Preparatory Course program exceeded “the allowable 8% above the body fat composition limit for initial entry, with the highest being 19%.” The report specified that no waivers were granted for these conditions, meaning these recruits should have never been admitted into the program.\n\nComplicating the matter, in addition to violating standards, was the strain admitting such people put on the Army’s medical resources, the report noted. Such practices are hazardous given that the recruits admitted above the acceptable body fat percentage levels could experience health problems. They must lose a significant amount of weight in a short period to meet the body fat percentages to graduate.\n\n“Based on interviews with ATC&FJ officials and the Division Medical Director and a review of ATC&FJ medical policy, we determined that ATC&FJ leadership prioritized the program’s already limited medical resources on the 14% of trainees above the authorized body fat composition limit,” the report read. “With the limited medical support and percentage of trainees above the body fat composition limit, the ARMS (Assessment of Recruit Motivation and Strength) 2.0 pilot program trainees are at an increased risk of suffering adverse medical consequences while trying to lose weight in a short time.”\n\nThe possible dangers include the risk of death, the report claimed, due to the need for trainees who were not compliant with body fat requirements “to lose weight quickly to meet the body fat percentage standards.”\n\nAccording to the policy, any recruit who sought to join the Army was supposed to be, at most, only 8% above body fat requirements to enlist before training to comply with military standards.\n\nSENATE CONFIRMS DANIEL DRISCOLL AS NEXT ARMY SECRETARY\n\nThe Army’s Future Soldier Preparatory Course was created to act as a backchannel entrance into the military for those who initially would be disqualified from enlisting due to being unable to meet requirements, such as physical fitness standards, among others, according to Military.com. If a recruit was outside these requirements, the applicant was granted 90 days to comply with Army regulations.\n\nAny recruit who failed to do so would not be admitted into the military branch.",

        "full_text": "US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he plans to offer a \"gold card\" granting wealthy applicants a path to citizenship at a price of $5 million (€4.76 million), replacing an investor visa that has existed for 35 years.\n\nDescribing the people he wanted to see apply, Trump told an Oval Office press conference: \"They'll be wealthy and they'll be successful, and they'll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people, and we think it's going to be extremely successful.\"\n\nAsked whether Russian oligarchs would be eligible for the gold card, Trump responded: “Yeah, possibly. I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people.”\n\nAccording to US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the \"Trump Gold Card\" is intended to replace EB-5 visas in two weeks.\n\nEB-5s were created by Congress in 1990 to generate foreign investment, and are available to people who spend about $1 million on a company that employs at least 10 people in the US.\n\nLutnick explained that the gold card — which would work similarly to a green card, or permanent legal residency, but granted simply in exchange for money — would raise the price of admission for investors and eliminate supposed fraud and \"nonsense\" that he said characterises the EB-5 programme.\n\nLike other green cards, it would include a path to citizenship.\n\nLutnick also said that gold card applicants will be vetted \"to make sure they’re wonderful world-class global citizens,\" but offered no details of how that standard would be set.\n\n'Maybe it will be fantastic'\n\nInvestors' visas or residence permits are common around the world. Henley & Partners, an advisory firm, says more than 100 countries offer so-called \"golden visas\" to wealthy individuals, including the US, UK, Spain, Greece, Malta, Australia, Canada and Italy.\n\nAccording to the US Department of Homeland Security's most recent Yearbook of Immigration Statistics, some 8,000 people obtained EB-5 visas in the year ending 30 September 2022.\n\nHowever, the Congressional Research Service warned in 2021 that the visas pose risks of fraud, including verification that funds were obtained legally.\n\nAnnoucing the gold card, Trump made no mention of any requirements for job creation. And whereas the number of EB-5 visas is capped, Trump mused that the federal government could sell 10 million gold cards, supposedly helping to reduce the deficit.\n\nHe said the proposed card \"could be great, maybe it will be fantastic\".\n\n\"It's somewhat like a green card, but at a higher level of sophistication, it's a road to citizenship for people, and essentially people of wealth or people of great talent, where people of wealth pay for those people of talent to get in, meaning companies will pay for people to get in and to have long, long term status in the country,\" he explained.\n\nWhile Congress sets legal qualifications for citizenship, Trump claimed the implementation of \"gold cards\" would not be subject to congressional approval.",

        "full_text": "As part of his proposed peace plan in Eastern Europe, President Donald Trump is demanding the full-scale economic colonization of Ukraine.\n\nThe terms of Trump’s initial proposal, detailed in a leaked document obtained by The Telegraph, call for U.S. control of Ukraine’s natural resources, ports, and infrastructure, including $500 billion of Ukraine’s mineral wealth as “payback” for the military aid. After years of military aid, Trump has decided now is the time to cash in.\n\nTrump’s proposal asks Ukraine for exclusive rights “in perpetuity” over its natural resources and infrastructure. “This agreement shall be governed by New York law, without regard to conflict of laws principles,” the contract specifies. And revenues would have to be paid to the U.S. before any other party. “That clause means ‘pay us first, and then feed your children,’” a source close to the negotiations told The Telegraph.\n\nTrump’s staggering claim to Ukraine’s mineral wealth is not new. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy himself proposed giving up Ukraine’s natural resources to secure Western aid. And, in Washington, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., previously floated the idea. “They’re sitting on trillion dollars of minerals that could be good for our economy,” Graham said, standing beside Zelenskyy during a visit to Ukraine last year. “So I want to keep helping our friends in Ukraine.”\n\nThe $500 billion figure equates to nearly three times the size of Ukraine’s gross domestic product. And, as observers have pointed out, the extent of Ukraine’s mineral wealth may be overstated. Still, it’s undeniable that Trump aims to use the tragedy of the Ukraine war to fatten the coffers of America’s military-industrial complex and capitalist classes.\n\nIt’s what he does everywhere. The news of Trump’s initial Ukraine proposal follows closely on the heels of his extreme bid to forcibly expel Palestinians from Gaza to turn it into the “Riviera of the Middle East,” a plot that could potentially be used to enrich the real estate developer’s friends.\n\nAs with Palestinians in Gaza, Trump’s vision for enriching his friends in the American ruling class will come at the expense of Ukrainians. And, as in Gaza, Ukraine has no good options, and any deal it accepts with Russia or the U.S. will include painful concessions.\n\nIt didn’t have to be this way.\n\nThere were several points at which a negotiated end to the conflict could have been reached. In the fall of 2022, when Ukraine had more leverage, a group of congressional progressives urged the Biden administration to pair support for Ukraine’s successes with a “proactive diplomatic push” to seek a ceasefire.\n\nThe lawmakers, and the pro-diplomacy camp in general, were relentlessly attacked and smeared for taking the position. Hawks and the so-called pro-Ukrainian side accused anyone who called for a diplomatic path of not caring about Ukrainian lives or sovereignty. They cheered on aggressive military assistance, arguing that even the meekest calls for negotiations were a gift to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe reality is that Ukraine’s war effort was never as stable as its Western supporters claimed.\n\nFrom the start, American lawmakers repeated the mantra that they would support Ukraine “for as long as it takes.” This was a deeply misleading promise. Wars are expensive, and America’s ability to finance them is determined by economic conditions, domestic politics, and shifting public sentiment. The political will to continue the war indefinitely was never sustainable, yet Ukrainian soldiers were sent into battle under the illusion that the U.S. would remain unwavering in its commitment.\n\nThe Biden administration’s Ukraine policy reflects a similar, if less explicit, mindset to Trump’s. Before Putin waged this war, there were offramps. A senior Biden official admitted the U.S. made no effort to negotiate on one of Putin’s top concerns before his invasion — Ukraine’s potential inclusion in NATO. When Kyiv and Moscow engaged in direct talks during the early weeks of the conflict, the U.S. and U.K. governments worked to undermine the negotiations, according to multiple reports.\n\nThe Biden administration also pressured Ukraine to lower its draft age from 25 to 18 to increase troop numbers and to deal “more aggressively” with the issue of having tens of thousands of soldiers who do not want to fight. Trump allies like Graham and national security adviser Mike Waltz have also pushed Ukraine to lower its draft age — calls that Zelensky has rejected and are politically unpopular among Ukrainians.\n\nPolicymakers in Washington never seriously reckoned with the immense human, economic, and social toll of the Ukraine war because they never had to. For them, it has always been a distant conflict, a tool to weaken Russia while positioning American interests in the region.\n\nTrump’s demand for “payback” from Ukraine — treating the bloodiest conflict in Europe since World War II as if it’s some unappreciated favor — presents U.S. foreign policy in its most naked form.\n\nAs a result of the West’s refusal to seriously consider diplomacy, Ukraine is left with impossible choices: fight a losing war without U.S. support, or submit to economic vassalage under the very powers that prolonged its suffering.",

        "full_text": "President Donald Trump’s pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and bilateral negotiations with Russia have spurred European leaders to offer promises to take charge of their own security and step up their defense commitments as they seek to keep the new administration engaged on the continent.\n\nLast week, President Trump shocked many European leaders when he appeared to blame Ukraine for provoking the war with Russia and labeled President Zelensky a “dictator” amid tense negotiations over a proposed mineral deal the administration views as a way for Ukraine to pay the United States back for its assistance.\n\nOne of President Trump’s chief negotiators, U.S. Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, echoed these sentiments later, telling CNN’s Jake Tapper last weekend that the war was provoked, “and that doesn’t necessarily mean that it was provoked by the Russians” and suggested that talks with Ukraine to one day join the NATO alliance may have been responsible.\n\n“That didn’t need to happen, it basically became a threat to the Russians,” Witkoff.\n\nA larger role\n\nMany European leaders reacted negatively to the Trump administration’s decision to meet with Russian negotiators last week in Saudi Arabia, warning that no lasting peace could be achieved by cutting the Europeans and Ukraine out of negotiations.\n\nOthers however tacked a different course. French President Emmanuel Macron, who traveled Washington, D.C. on Monday in an attempt to bridge the gap, is leading a European effort promising to take on a larger security role on the continent to convince the Americans to stay engaged in finding a lasting peace for the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nMacron visited the American capital on the heels of his own “emergency” European summit on how to end the three-year war in Ukraine. The meeting ended with no firm plans, but it helped forge a common message from European leaders. Macron brought assurances from the United States’ European allies that they are willing to do more to answer President Trump’s concerns, specifically about their own contribution to the continent’s defense.\n\nMacron reassured President Trump that Europe, and specifically France, shares the ultimate goal of peace in the Russia-Ukraine war. He also reiterated his warning that security guarantees for Ukraine are necessary for a “solid” peace, one that would stop conflict from erupting again after any brief pause in fighting.\n\n“I think our common objective…is to build peace and a solid and longstanding peace, and this is what we will discuss, obviously, because I have great respect for bravery and the resistance of Ukrainian people, and we do share the objective of peace, because we are very aware of the necessity to to have guarantees and solid peace in order to stabilize the situation,” Macron said after his meeting with Trump.\n\nMacron also said, on behalf of the European leaders, that Europe is willing to “step up to be a stronger partner, to do more in defense and security for this continent,” which Trump has long demanded since his first term in office.\n\n\"indifferent to the fate of Europe\"\n\nGermany's Friedrich Merz who is slated to be the next chancellor following the country’s elections on Sunday, said that it might be time for Europe to seek “independence” from the United States on defense.\n\n“After Donald Trump’s statements last week, it is clear that the Americans, at least this part of the Americans, this administration, are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe,” Merz said in an interview, according to Politico. In the past, Merz has proposed a new defense alliance, separate from NATO, as U.S. engagement in Europe declines.\n\n“We must prepare for the worst-case scenario,” he said. “One in which American engagement in European security significantly declines.” But Merz does not necessarily see this as an existential threat to Germany’s alliance with the United States.\n\nIn fact, Merz has floated several policies for Germany that may give Trump exactly what he wants: NATO allies that spend more on their own defense and take on a greater role in European security. For example, Merz has proposed a European security alliance separate from NATO that would take on issues vital to the continent’s security, but which are less important for the United States.\n\nMerz made clear that he does not believe that any European efforts should replace the longstanding alliance with the United States, however, stating in an interview that he believes a strong stand by a united Europe could keep the United States engaged.\n\n“Keeping our alliance with the U.S. intact is vital,” Merz said. “NATO is not just a military pact, it’s a political alliance built on shared values: democracy, open societies, and market economies. I sincerely hope we can continue to uphold these principles together.”\n\nItaly\n\nItaly’s leader Giorgia Meloni, a strong ideological ally of President Trump, invoked shared values in a virtual speech delivered directly to Trump’s core supporters gathered at the Conservative Political Action Conference last weekend near Washington, D.C. in which she urged conservatives to continue supporting Ukraine and work to secure a long-lasting peace with the cooperation of Europe.\n\n“You cannot defend your freedom if you lack the means or the courage to do so. Happiness depends on freedom and freedom depends on courage. We proved this when we stopped invasions, won our independences, and overthrew dictators,” Meloni said. “And we have done it together the last three years in Ukraine, where a proud people fight for their freedom against the brutal aggression.”\n\nMeloni said that achieving a “a just and lasting peace” requires it being “built with the contribution of all,” emphasizing that peace cannot be achieved without European cooperation.\n\nHer remarks also appeared to include a veiled warning to her ally, comparing a potential abandonment of Ukraine to President Biden’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, from which his administration never fully recovered.\n\n“And I know that with Donald Trump leading the United States we will never again see the disaster we saw in Afghanistan four years ago,” Meloni said.\n\nPeacekeeping forces\n\nFrance’s Macron and the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister Kier Starmer reportedly have begun to develop a plan that would see 30,000 European peacekeepers deployed to Ukraine if a ceasefire is signed with Russia, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn his meeting with Macron, Trump said he approved of the idea, likely seeing it as a way to provide security guarantees that Ukraine seeks without using U.S. troops directly. Macron and Starmer, who is set to visit Washington himself on Thursday, both believe that a U.S. “backstop” would be necessary to protect European troops in Ukraine and to deter Russia from violating a potential ceasefire.\n\nTrump gave no indication whether U.S. troops would be involved in the plan, but said he believed the European forces would be enough to secure the peace.\n\n“And a lot of the European countries, I think I don't want to speak for France, but I know that the [French] president's talked about doing that also, I think that'll be a very good day when we can go in as peacekeepers, as opposed to what's going on right now with everybody being killed,” Trump said.\n\n“And I don't think you're going to need much backing. I think that's not going to be a problem. Once an agreement is signed, Russia is going to get back to its business, and Ukraine and Europe are going to get back to their business. I don't think it's going to be a problem,” he said.",

        "full_text": "Billion Indians have no spending money - report\n\n2 days ago\n\nNikhil Inamdar, BBC News, Mumbai\n\nIndia is home to 1.4 billion people but around a billion lack money to spend on any discretionary goods or services, a new report estimates.\n\nThe country's consuming class, effectively the potential market for start-ups or business owners, is only about as big as Mexico, 130-140 million people, according to the report from Blume Ventures, a venture capital firm.\n\nAnother 300 million are \"emerging\" or \"aspirant\" consumers but they are reluctant spenders who have only just begun to open their purse strings, as click-of-a-button digital payments make it easy to transact.\n\nWhat is more, the consuming class in Asia's third largest economy is not \"widening\" as much as it is \"deepening\", according to the report. That basically means India's wealthy population is not really growing in numbers, even though those who are already rich are getting even wealthier.\n\nAll of this is shaping the country's consumer market in distinct ways, particularly accelerating the trend of \"premiumisation\" where brands drive growth by doubling down on expensive, upgraded products catering to the wealthy, rather than focusing on mass-market offerings.\n\nThis is evident in zooming sales of ultra-luxury gated housing and premium phones, even as their lower-end variants struggle. Affordable homes now constitute just 18% of India's overall market compared with 40% five years ago. Branded goods are also capturing a bigger share of the market. And the \"experience economy\" is booming, with expensive tickets for concerts by international artists like Coldplay and Ed Sheeran selling like hot cakes.\n\nWhy global stars like Coldplay and Ed Sheeran are hitting India\n\nCompanies that have adapted to these shifts have thrived, Sajith Pai, one of the report's authors, told the BBC. \"Those who are too focused at the mass end or have a product mix that doesn't have exposure to the premium end have lost market share.\"\n\nThe report's findings bolster the long-held view that India's post-pandemic recovery has been K-shaped - where the rich have got richer, while the poor have lost purchasing power.\n\nIn fact, this has been a long-term structural trend that began even before the pandemic. India has been getting increasingly more unequal, with the top 10% of Indians now holding 57.7% of national income compared with 34% in 1990. The bottom half have seen their share of national income fall from 22.2% to 15%.\n\nThe latest consumption slump, however, has deepened amid not just a destruction in purchasing power, but also a precipitous drop in financial savings and surging indebtedness among the masses.\n\nThe country's central bank has also cracked down on easy unsecured lending that propped up demand after the Covid pandemic.\n\nMuch of the consumption spending of the \"emerging\" or \"aspirant\" class of Indians was led by such borrowing and \"turning off that tap will definitely have some impact on consumption\", says Pai.\n\nIn the short run, two things are expected to help boost spending - a pick-up in rural demand on the back of a record harvest and a $12 billion tax give-away in the recently concluded budget. It will not be \"dramatic\" but could boost India's GDP - largely driven by consumption - by over half a percent, says Pai.\n\nBut major longer-term headwinds remain.\n\nIndia's middle class - which has been a major engine for consumer demand - is being squeezed out, with wages pretty much staying flat, according to data compiled by Marcellus Investment Managers.\n\n\"The middle 50% of India's tax-paying population has seen its income stagnate in absolute terms over the past decade. This implies a halving of income in real terms [adjusted for inflation],\" says the report, published in January.\n\n\"This financial hammering has decimated the middle class's savings - the RBI [Reserve Bank of India] has repeatedly highlighted that net financial savings of Indian households are approaching a 50-year low. This pounding suggests that products and services associated with middle-class household spending are likely to face a rough time in the years ahead,\" it adds.\n\nThe Marcellus report also points out that white-collar urban jobs are becoming harder to come by as artificial intelligence automates clerical, secretarial and other routine work. \"The number of supervisors employed in manufacturing units [as a percentage of all employed] in India has gone down significantly,\" it adds.\n\nThe government's recent economic survey has flagged these concerns as well.\n\nIt says labour displacement as a result of these technological advancements is of particular concern for a mainly services-driven economy like India, where a significant share of the IT workforce is employed in low value-added services sectors that are most prone to disruption.\n\n\"India is also a consumption-based economy, thus the fall in consumption that can result from the displacement of its workforce is bound to have macroeconomic implications. If the worst-case projections materialise, this could have the potential to set the country's economic growth trajectory off course,\" the survey says.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "full_text": "Apple users in the United Kingdom will no longer have access to a key data security feature for iCloud storage: Advanced Data Protection. It’s a relatively small change, but privacy experts worry it could have ripple effects for data privacy around the world.\n\nThe iPhone maker confirmed last week that it would end access for UK users to the optional end-to-end encryption feature, which helps to ensure that only users can access their own personal data, such as photos and messages.\n\nThe move was widely viewed as an effort to avoid complying with a request from the British government for a technical “back door” to access user data. Still, the situation could serve as an example that other governments could follow to undermine user privacy, experts say.\n\n“This has always been one of our major concerns,” said Caroline Wilson, general counsel at UK-based nonprofit Privacy International. “The fact that the UK government… is setting a bad precedent for other governments around the world.”\n\nApple said in a statement that it is “gravely disappointed” to no longer offer the feature to UK users, “given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy.”\n\nBut the company had little choice, experts say.\n\n“Apple was in a very difficult spot here,” said John Verdi, senior vice president of policy at Washington, DC-based advocacy group Future of Privacy Forum. “Folks in the United Kingdom simply will not have available the top level of security that Apple provides elsewhere in the world.”\n\nWhat is Advanced Data Protection?\n\nApple’s iCloud storage service uses end-to-end encryption to protect 14 categories of sensitive data by default, including health data and passwords, stored in users’ iCloud Keychain.\n\nThat means user data is basically scrambled when it’s stored on Apple’s servers, and only the user who holds the account can access it in its un-scrambled form. So, no one with access to Apple’s servers — like hackers, or even the company itself — could read users’ sensitive data.\n\n“In the digital world, end-to-end encryption is going to be your best bet for getting a truly private and secure conversation that’s kind of on the level of what you could have in person,” said Joe Mullin, a senior policy analyst for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nAdvanced Data Protection, or ADP, extends end-to-end encryption for additional categories of data, including photos, notes, voice memos and iCloud backups (think text messages and call logs). So, in the event of a data breach, for example, content like this would be inaccessible to a hacker since even Apple can’t read it.\n\n“One of the very few ways to make sure that your data can’t be leaked if a company is breached is to make sure that the company (itself) doesn’t have it,” said Sarah Scheffler, an assistant professor in Carnegie Mellon’s Cylab Security and Privacy Institute.\n\nUK users will now lose protection for those additional categories of data. Those who have not already enabled ADP are no longer able to do so, and Apple says it will soon provide guidance to existing users on how to disable the feature.\n\nThere are third-party cloud storage options that offer end-to-end encryption, like NordLocker and Proton Drive. But Mullin notes that consumers are less likely to use them because they’d have to go through extra steps, whereas Apple’s system can back up your phone automatically when it’s locked and connected to power and Wi-Fi.\n\n“You kind of need these encrypted services on some level from the people that are making the (operating system) on your phone,” said Mullin. “That’s why so much of the encryption conversation is around what Google and Apple are doing.”\n\nAdvanced Data Protection will still be available outside of the UK. For UK users, those standard end-to-end encrypted data categories will not change, and iMessage and FaceTime will remain end-to-end encrypted.\n\n“It’s a shame,” Verdi said. “It makes British citizens less safe.”\n\nThe UK fight over data access\n\nApple’s move comes weeks after multiple news outlets reported that British security officials had ordered Apple to build a technical back door that would allow access to the company’s global user data. The demand reportedly came under the Investigatory Powers Act, which lets British law enforcement compel access to communications and metadata from tech companies in secret.\n\nApple has built its brand around privacy and previously resisted building back doors to allow governments or law enforcement access to its users’ information.\n\n“As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will,” the company said in a statement regarding the change to ADP.\n\nBut without end-to-end encryption, Apple could have access to users’ data, which means law enforcement could legally compel the company to hand it over to aid in the investigation and prosecution of crimes. That may be why Apple believes the move to end ADP in the region will be enough for the British government.\n\n“The decision to pull this privacy feature in the UK is an attempt to hopefully not undermine it in the rest of the world,” Wilson said.\n\nApple has declined to comment directly on the British demand. The UK’s Home Office, which is responsible for making requests under the Investigatory Powers Act, did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nA broader security threat\n\nBut even if it makes it easier for law enforcement to access user data, it’s “impossible to provide exceptional access” to data for some parties without “undermining security for everyone,” Verdi said.\n\n“Either everyone is protected by strong encryption, or it’s weakened for everyone,” he said.\n\nHe added that law enforcement could instead seek to access data directly from, with a warrant that compels them to unlock their devices.\n\nIn the wake of the UK’s move, Verdi says he sees “two possible futures.” In one scenario, other governments could decide they want to do the opposite of the UK and give individuals, companies and government officials the “best security Apple has to offer,” boosting encryption protections. But some governments could also follow the UK’s lead and “seek to undermine security” by passing rules or making demands that force tech companies to weaken their encryption.\n\n“What happens now?” said Scheffler. “This is one piece in a very large puzzle over… the future of privacy, and the future security and the future of encryption.”",

        "full_text": "Speaker Mike Johnson pulled off a stunning turnaround Tuesday night to rescue a critical vote to advance President Donald Trump’s agenda that had seemed doomed just moments earlier.\n\nSurprising even some of his critics, Johnson and his leadership team capped hours of drama in the Capitol by successfully flipping multiple Republican holdouts to pass a budget blueprint that will mark the first step toward moving Trump’s ambitious agenda forward. With help from last-minute phone calls from Trump, GOP leaders spent all of Tuesday in a furious pressure campaign to win backing for their plan.\n\n“The world didn’t end today. But I do see the edge,” Rep. Pat Fallon, a Texas Republican, said of the whiplash in the House.\n\nRepublicans had punted the vote Tuesday night only to turn around minutes later to call fleeing members back to the floor to muscle through the plan.\n\nIn the end, Johnson lost just a single vote — fiscal hawk Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky — which was all he could afford. The Democrats’ whip team scrambled to get near-full attendance on their side: Rep. Brittany Pettersen flew with her 4-week-old baby to make it in time for the vote and Rep. Kevin Mullin, who is recovering from complications from knee surgery, flew with an IV from California.\n\nBut the drama won’t end there: Johnson and his allies acknowledge that what comes next will be much more difficult. Tuesday night’s vote itself was procedural and GOP leaders from the House and Senate will need to agree on how exactly to move ahead with Trump’s sprawling legislative package now that they have adopted divergent plans. The days-long saga over the House budget blueprint laid bare bitter divisions among Republicans that will make it extraordinarily difficult to pass that package in both chambers.\n\nStill, the win comes at a critical time for Trump and Johnson as their party faces crushing deadlines ahead, including avoiding a government shutdown next month and the threat of an economic default later this spring. As with Tuesday night’s vote, navigating those political landmines will require near total unity from the GOP.\n\nGOP leaders will now get to work on exactly what will make it into Trump’s first legislative package. The newly passed House GOP plan calls for sweeping tax cuts, steep spending cuts and a two-year debt limit hike, as well as new money for border security and energy production. The Senate’s plan, however, contains only national security and energy money, while punting on the more contentious items for later.\n\nThe stakes are high for GOP leaders: Trump is eager to pass his agenda as quickly as possible, even as party leaders must comply with the extremely strict constraints of the budget powers that allow their party to pass a package without Democratic votes. And Republicans will need to tread carefully on reforms to popular programs like Medicaid, food assistance and Pell grants — concerns that nearly sunk the budget plan this week.\n\nThe successful vote capped a dramatic 12 hours for Johnson. In the morning, he held a tense meeting with House Republicans to convince his members to back the budget blueprint or risk forgoing key parts of Trump’s agenda.\n\nBut by the afternoon, House GOP leaders were still struggling to lock down the votes, and even the relentlessly upbeat Johnson acknowledged he may need to pull it.\n\nThe votes weren’t there around 7:30 p.m., when the speaker moved to scrap plans to hold the vote at all. But then his leadership team — with help from a Trump call to Rep. Victoria Spartz — was able to win over the last holdouts. So, just moments after dismissing members, Johnson called them back to vote and passed the GOP’s budget blueprint.\n\nRep. Warren Davidson, an Ohio Republican, said he decided to change his vote after he received “assurances” of a future plan that could survive the Senate to trim discretionary spending, though he offered no specifics.\n\nAnd Spartz added that she spoke with Trump on health care issues, saying, “He’s on board to get some great things done on health care. … I trust his word.”\n\n“I think the last few weeks are showing us how difficult it is to move any package through the House,” Rep. Dusty Johnson, a leadership ally, acknowledged earlier Tuesday. “This is a motley crew.”\n\nHours before the scheduled vote, hardline conservatives insisted there weren’t enough spending cuts in the plan, even as centrist-leaning Republicans remained uneasy about the size of those cuts and whether they could impact popular programs like Medicaid. And Johnson’s efforts to win support even backfired in some corners. Massie said he left a meeting Tuesday morning even more dug in against the budget than before.\n\n“They convinced me in there, I’m a no,” the Kentucky Republican said, holding up a thick packet of leadership talking points and railing against their plans line by line. By the time of the vote, Massie remained the only GOP “no.”\n\nJohnson and his whip team had spent the last several days trying to win over their more moderate members, many of whom had raised concerns that the budget plan could ultimately lead to cuts to the low-income health program Medicaid.\n\nAhead of the vote, Republicans from northeastern states were particularly wary of plans to cut $880 billion over a decade from federal health and energy programs, which they fear cannot be achieved without cutting Medicaid, the hugely expensive health program, since Trump has vowed not to touch Medicare.\n\nGOP leaders have strongly pushed back against the idea that benefits would be cut, noting that the budget plan is only a framework and not specific policy. They argue there are ways to cut hundreds of billions in wasted money on federal health programs without slashing Medicaid benefits, though it remains unclear where those cuts would come from.\n\n“This is a procedural vote. You tell me what the cuts are,” House Majority Whip Tom Emmer told CNN when asked about swing seat lawmakers’ concerns about Medicaid cuts.\n\nIn the end, Johnson only recorded a single Republican defection.\n\n“We will get there, as we always do,” the speaker predicted earlier in the day, when he was still lacking at least a half-dozen votes.\n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN’s Manu Raju, Alison Main, Morgan Rimmer, Veronica Stracqualursi and Aileen Graef contributed to this report.",

        "full_text": "Summary Companies House narrowly approves move to advance $4.5 trillion tax-cut plan Hardline Republicans sought deeper spending cuts Swing district lawmakers concerned about impact on social programs WASHINGTON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives late on Tuesday advanced President Donald Trump 's tax-cut and border security agenda, delivering a major boost to his 2025 priorities. The vote on passage was 217-215 with Representative Thomas Massie, a prominent fiscal hawk, as a lone Republican voting in opposition, and no Democrats supporting the controversial measure. One Democrat did not vote. The measure is a preliminary step to extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts later this year. Tuesday's vote sent the budget resolution to the Senate, where Republicans are expected to take it up. \"We have a lot of hard work ahead of us, but we are going to deliver the American First agenda,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters after the vote. \"We're going to celebrate tonight, and we'll roll up our sleeves and get right back in the morning.\" The final vote came after Johnson and No. 2 House Republican Steve Scalise spent hours persuading holdouts to back the move. The measure's passage followed an unusual series of maneuvers in which Johnson canceled a vote on the bill, because it lacked the votes for passage, and then promptly reversed course. Both leaders said Trump himself had been contacting reluctant members about the need to advance the $4.5 trillion tax-cut plan, which would also fund the deportation of migrants living in the U.S. illegally, tighten border security, energy deregulation and military spending.

REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz/File Photo Speaker of the House Mike Johnson speaks during a House Republican members conference meeting in Trump National Doral resort, in Miami, Florida, U.S. January 27, 2025. REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz/File Photo , Several hardline conservatives sought deeper spending cuts and stronger control over separate government funding legislation to avert a potential shutdown after current funding expires on March 14. Three Republican hardliners seen initially as firm no votes - Tim Burchett, Victoria Spartz and Warren Davidson - wound up voting for the measure in the end. Doubts about House Republican unity prompted Senate Republicans to enact their own budget resolution as a Plan B ploy last week: a $340 billion measure that covers Trump's border, defense and energy priorities but leaves the thornier issue of tax policy for later in the year. Both chambers need to pass the same budget resolution to unlock a parliamentary tool that Republicans will need later this year to circumvent Democratic opposition and the Senate filibuster and enact legislation containing the Trump agenda. The House budget seeks $2 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years to pay for Trump's agenda. The tax cuts Trump is seeking would extend breaks passed during his first term in office, his main legislative accomplishment, that are due to expire at the end of this year. Passing a budget resolution is just the first deadline facing lawmakers in the coming months. Lawmakers also need to enact fiscal 2025 spending legislation to keep federal agencies operating after current funding expires on March 14. Later this year they will need to act on the federal government's self-imposed debt ceiling or risk triggering catastrophic default on its $36 trillion in debt.

        "full_text": "The eventual ruling in the case, Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services, could determine whether so-called reverse discrimination claims should be evaluated under the same standards as those brought by historically marginalized groups.\n\nWhat is the legal issue before the Supreme Court?\n\nAt the heart of the case is the “background circumstances” rule, a legal test used by some federal courts when majority-group plaintiffs, such as white or straight employees, bring discrimination claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This rule requires these plaintiffs to prove that their employer is “that unusual employer who discriminates against the majority.”\n\nMarlean Ames, a former Ohio Department of Youth Services employee and plaintiff in the case, argues that the rule makes it significantly harder for white and straight workers to bring discrimination lawsuits. Ames claims she was passed over for a promotion and later demoted in favor of less-qualified gay employees, a complaint that was rejected by two lower courts beneath the highest.\n\nAmes sued in the Southern District of Ohio, but her case was dismissed for failing to meet the background circumstances rule. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal, acknowledging her discrimination claim was plausible since she was demoted and replaced by gay employees but ruling that she failed to meet the extra burden required for majority-group plaintiffs.\n\nHowever, several other circuit courts have chosen not to apply the background circumstances rule in discrimination cases, creating a split beckoning the nine justices to bring clarity to the issue. The Supreme Court is now set to resolve a circuit split on whether the background circumstances rule should remain in place during an oral argument hearing at 10 a.m. local time.\n\nHow does this case relate to the Supreme Court’s recent rulings on discrimination?\n\nThe case marks another major fight over discrimination since the Supreme Court’s landmark 2023 ruling in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard/UNC, which struck down race-based affirmative action in college admissions as a violation of the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause.\n\nThat decision held that eliminating discrimination means eliminating it entirely, a principle Ames and her supporters argue should apply equally to employment law.\n\nThe Equal Protection Project, led by Legal Insurrection founder William Jacobson, argues in an amicus brief that “reverse discrimination is no longer unusual; it is unfortunately alive and well.”\n\nThe brief states that discrimination against white and straight employees has become “ubiquitous,” particularly under corporate DEI initiatives, and that they should not be subject to a higher legal burden.\n\nWhat are the arguments supporting Ames?\n\nAmes and her supporters argue that the background circumstances rule unfairly places a higher burden on majority-group plaintiffs, making it harder for them to challenge workplace discrimination.\n\nAmerica First Legal, which has filed numerous lawsuits against DEI policies, argues that “nothing in Title VII supports a higher burden for ‘majority’ employees who claim discrimination.”\n\nWhat are the arguments against Ames?\n\nThe Ohio Department of Youth Services defends the background circumstances test as a necessary tool for evaluating discrimination claims fairly. The department warns that eliminating this requirement could open the floodgates to lawsuits challenging diversity policies and complicate efforts to enforce employment laws.\n\nIn December, former Biden administration Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar led an amicus brief in support of the department, arguing, “The district court did not apply the ‘background circumstances’ requirement to Ames’s claim that she was demoted because she is a woman.”\n\nA coalition of civil rights organizations, including the NAACP, argues that courts must consider the history of systemic inequality in employment discrimination cases. “Majority-group plaintiffs cannot rely on the same legacy of discrimination to support their claims,” their amicus brief states. The NAACP contends that eliminating the background circumstances rule could make it harder to address long-standing disparities in hiring and promotion.\n\nWhat stands to change if Ames wins?\n\nA ruling in favor of Ames could make it significantly easier for nonminority employees to bring viable discrimination complaints against employers, depending on the circumstances of their claims.\n\nAPPLE SHAREHOLDERS REJECT OVERHAULING DEI PROGRAM’S ‘ILLEGAL DISCRIMINATION’\n\nIn turn, a favorable ruling for Ames could reshape workplace diversity initiatives and make DEI policies more legally vulnerable, as conservative groups saw as a logical next step with the undoing of affirmative action for college admissions two years ago.\n\nWith the Supreme Court’s Republican-appointed majority having already dismantled affirmative action in college admissions, Ames v. Ohio could become another defining decision in the legal battles over race, gender, and workplace discrimination.",

        "full_text": "In his opening weeks back in office, President Trump is asserting power in a way that pushes hard on, and sometimes past, the boundaries of executive authority.\n\nOne of the most important of those boundaries involves his relationship with independent regulatory agencies. Mr. Trump is the first president since the 1930s to assert control over many of them, and this assertion of power will almost certainly be tested in the Supreme Court.\n\nMr. Trump is operating under the theory that the executive branch is unitary, in the sense that Article II of the Constitution places executive power in a single person, the president, who gets to control every high-level official who executes federal law (and plenty of lower-level ones, too).\n\nIf Mr. Trump succeeds in court, the country will see a significant shift in power from the independent agencies to the White House.\n\nFor better or for worse, that shift would be profoundly unsettling. And in some respects it could be dangerous — if, for example, a president is allowed to control monetary policy, or if he is in charge of the Federal Communications Commission, and thus able to play politics with national communications policy.\n\nThe president is not a king. In its most extreme version, the unitary executive theory is a form of invented history, a modern creation that threatens to change, and in important ways to undermine, the operations of the national government.\n\nThe theory of the unitary executive means that the president can fire, at his pleasure, the heads of the Federal Trade Commission, the National Labor Relations Board and other independent agencies. In its strongest form, the unitary executive theory means that the president can control the policy choices of those agencies. So if the F.T.C. wants to issue a rule to protect consumers, and the president thinks that’s a terrible idea, then he can prevent that rule from seeing the light of day.\n\nThe unitary executive theory is supported by some distinguished scholars, who point to the Constitution’s text. The first sentence of Article II states that “the executive power shall be vested in a president of the United States of America.” The same article gives the president, and no one else, the power to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.”\n\nEveryone agrees that at the Constitutional Convention, the founders decided to have just one president, rather than a “plural” executive. Practically everyone also agrees that the very first Congress, in creating the departments of Treasury, War and Foreign Affairs, made a momentous decision, widely known as the Decision of 1789: Their heads would be at-will employees of the president. The Decision of 1789 is often thought to show acceptance of the unitary executive theory.\n\nThe current conflict over the president’s authority owes its origins to the New Deal period. In a 1935 case, Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, the court ruled that Congress could limit the president’s power to remove a head of the F.T.C. — and thus that it could create independent agencies.\n\nUntil recently, many people agreed that under Humphrey’s Executor, independent agencies are just fine under the law, and that the president does not have much authority over them. In the early 1980s, I worked in the Justice Department under President Ronald Reagan, whose White House liked the idea of a unitary executive and who wanted to know if he could exert at least some control over the independent agencies.\n\nLawyers in the Justice Department decided that Humphrey’s Executor was settled law — but that it left the president some running room. If he wanted, we said, he could direct independent agencies to submit their regulations to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, the president’s regulatory clearinghouse, for a degree of scrutiny and review. We did not think that the president could tell the independent agencies what rules to issue, but we did think that he could require them to subject their rules to a process of comment and analysis by the regulatory office.\n\nReagan decided not to impose that requirement, partly because of the seriousness of the legal question, and partly because of fear of a fierce congressional pushback.\n\nIn the past four decades, both Republican and Democratic presidents have followed Reagan’s lead. To be sure, they have overseen internal discussions about whether to assert the unitariness of the executive and to require independent agencies to submit their rules to the O.I.R.A.\n\nI was administrator of O.I.R.A. from 2009 to 2012, and the issue came up. The White House’s ultimate judgment was that presidential control would not be a good idea. Some government lawyers thought it would raise serious legal doubts. Other White House officials thought that, for one thing, independent agencies avoided an excessive concentration of power in one person. For another, such agencies reduced the risk of self-dealing (as might occur if, for example, a president rewarded his friends and punished his enemies).\n\nMore recently, the Supreme Court has shown a distinct discomfort with the whole idea of independent agencies. In Seila Law v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, decided in 2020, the court struck down a provision making the bureau independent on the ground that it was headed by a single person. The court purported to preserve Humphrey’s Executor and the multimember independent agencies (like the F.C.C., the N.L.R.B. and the Fed). But at the same time, the court spoke enthusiastically about the unitary executive, and it is reasonable to doubt whether Humphrey’s Executor will ultimately survive.\n\nPresident Trump does not like the idea of independent agencies. He recently fired a member of the N.L.R.B., even though board members can be discharged, under the law, only for “neglect of duty or malfeasance in office, but for no other cause.”\n\nHis acting solicitor general has said that the Justice Department intends to contest the for-cause protections given to the F.T.C., the N.L.R.B. and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. (Why she singled out those three agencies is not entirely clear.)\n\nThe acting solicitor general also said that in certain contexts, the department will contest the idea of independent administrative law judges — adjudicators within the executive branch who do not serve at the president’s pleasure.\n\nAnd the president has directed the independent agencies to submit their rules for O.I.R.A. review, reversing the course set by Reagan and presidential administrations since.\n\nMr. Trump may ultimately win in court, but the best historical research throws the whole idea of a unitary executive into serious doubt. In the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton, who rejected a plural executive, also insisted that the president lacks unlimited removal power.\n\nAnd defenders of the unitary executive appear to have misunderstood the Decision of 1789. The most careful evidence suggests that, at the time, a majority of members of Congress did not embrace but actually rejected the view that Congress lacks power to protect subordinate officials in the executive branch from presidential control. Indeed, independent agencies are hardly a creation of the New Deal — they have been with us since the founding era.\n\nIt follows that if you are an originalist, you will probably reject Mr. Trump’s broadest claims.\n\nThen there’s stare decisis, or precedent. The Trump administration’s claims would upset law that has been settled for 90 years. It’s true that the current court has not always respected stare decisis, but it has yet to undertake the kind of radical revision of national institutions that would come from invalidating independent agencies.\n\nRequiring some independent agencies to submit their rules to O.I.R.A. would hardly be the end of the world. It could even do some good. O.I.R.A.’s staffers do a thorough, careful job, and agency regulations are usually improved by the process of review. It would not be unreasonable for the Supreme Court to allow the White House and the regulatory office to comment on, and have some degree of control over, the regulations of most of the independent agencies.\n\nBut the case of the Fed puts a bright spotlight on the potential danger of giving the president unlimited authority over independent agencies. There are strong reasons for its independence. If a president could control interest rates, or oversee regulations that are connected to monetary policy, he could manage the economy so as to promote his own short-term political interests.\n\nOr take the F.C.C. A president who oversees its decisions could punish news sources that he didn’t like and reward those he loved.\n\nOr consider the claim that the president gets to impound congressionally appropriated funds and choose which ones to spend. That claim would render Congress subordinate to the executive in what might be its most fundamental power: the purse. Impoundment authority, on the part of the president, would go well beyond the idea of a unitary executive. It would be a devastating blow to the separation of powers.\n\nThere are decent arguments in favor of reforms that would increase presidential control over the administrative state. But the broadest current claims about executive authority are a creation of the 21st century, not the 18th. They are a form of hubris. They strike at the heart of our founding document.",

        "full_text": "FBI leadership is starting an investigation into the origins of the agency’s plan a decade ago to infiltrate the campaign of presidential candidate Donald Trump using two female undercover “honeypot” agents.\n\nThe off-the-books investigation, launched in 2015 by FBI Director James B. Comey, was revealed by an agency whistleblower in a protected disclosure to the House Judiciary Committee last year and first reported exclusively by The Washington Times in October.\n\nIn the intelligence community, a honeypot commonly refers to an undercover operative, usually a woman, who feigns sexual or romantic interest to obtain information from a target.\n\nThe whistleblower said two female FBI undercover employees infiltrated Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign at high levels and were directed to act as “honeypots” while traveling with Mr. Trump and his campaign staff.\n\nThe Times has learned that the bureau, now led by Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino, is looking for those once-undercover employees under Mr. Comey’s direction.\n\nThe FBI declined to comment.\n\nAccording to the whistleblower disclosure, which The Times reviewed, the investigation differed from Crossfire Hurricane, a later FBI counterintelligence operation that looked into never-proved allegations that the campaign was colluding with Russia.\n\nThe whistleblower said the early off-the-books criminal investigation targeted Mr. Trump and his staff.\n\nMr. Trump launched his presidential campaign on June 16, 2015, about a year before the FBI opened Crossfire Hurricane.\n\nThe whistleblower agent “personally knew” that Mr. Comey ordered an FBI investigation into Mr. Trump and that Mr. Comey “personally directed it,” according to the disclosure.\n\nThe investigation did not appear to target a specific crime but was more of what agents would describe as a fishing expedition to find anything incriminating against Mr. Trump.\n\nThe whistleblower said the undercover operation was obscured from Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz, who investigated misconduct in the bureau’s probe of the Trump campaign.\n\n“The case had no predicated foundation, so Comey personally directed the investigation without creating an official case file in Sentinel or any other FBI system,” according to the whistleblower’s disclosure. “The FBI has multiple methods of protecting highly sensitive investigations, so Comey did not have a legitimate reason not to officially create an official investigation file or have a file number.”\n\nThe disclosure says the secret investigation may have indicated institutional bias at the FBI against Mr. Trump, though “it does not appear that any information about this investigation was turned over to Trump’s criminal defense counsels.”\n\nThe investigation was eventually closed because a major newspaper obtained a photograph of one of the undercovers and was about to publish it, but the FBI press office told the outlet that the photograph was an FBI informant who would be killed if the photograph was publicly released.\n\nIn fact, it was a photograph of the FBI undercover employee.\n\nThe FBI whistleblower employee noted in the disclosure that one of the undercovers agreed to be transferred to the CIA so she would not be available as a potential witness.\n\nThe other undercover employee was rewarded for her activities through a promotion in the bureau and is now a high-level FBI executive in a major field office.\n\nThe whistleblower employee observed one or more employees in the FBI being directed to never discuss the operation with anyone ever again, including other people involved in the 2016 Trump campaign infiltration operation.",

Instead, he said, there was probably software code somewhere on Apple’s systems that caused iPhones to write the word “Trump” when someone said “racist.”\n\n“This smells like a serious prank,” Mr. Burkey said. “The only question is: Did someone slip this into the data or slip into the code?”\n\nThe issue was the latest stumble at Apple since the company introduced a new A.I. system last year called Apple Intelligence.

        "full_text": "“We’re going to celebrate tonight,” Johnson told reporters after the vote, adding that House Republicans will “roll up their sleeves” as they prepared to reconcile their plans with the Senate.\n\nTuesday night’s vote came after a wild scene on the House floor that played out over the course of hours. Around 6:30 p.m. members were called to the floor to begin voting on an unrelated measure, with the budget plan to follow. But that unrelated vote was held open for more than an hour as the GOP whip team worked to win over the holdouts.\n\nDemocrats screamed “regular order” as the planned 15-minute vote stretched on and on. Shortly after 7:30 p.m., the vote was closed and members were informed the budget vote was canceled. Minutes later, leaders sent out another alert saying the vote was back on.\n\nThe holdouts included Reps. Tim Burchett of Tennessee, Warren Davidson of Ohio, and Victoria Spartz of Indiana, as well as Massie. All four voiced public opposition to the budget plan Tuesday and could be seen on the House floor during the evening vote series speaking to various Republican leaders.\n\nThe fiscal hawks all raised objections about inadequate spending cuts in the measure; Davidson also aired concerns about how Republican leaders plan to handle the impending March 14 government funding deadline.\n\nTrump spoke over the phone at various points with several of the holdouts, according to two Republicans familiar with the whip effort — Johnson later said the calls were “a big help.” Because of the House GOP’s tiny majority and the united opposition of Democrats, those four members could together block action.\n\nBut Johnson and Trump managed to win them over, one by one.\n\nSpartz said in a online post that she came around because Trump had a “personal commitment to save healthcare and make it better for physical and fiscal health for all Americans. ... I trust his word.”\n\nDavidson said in his own post that he “finally received the assurances I needed that there will be cuts to discretionary spending” ahead of the March funding deadline “and that we will work together to develop a plan for further discretionary spending cuts that could survive passage in the Senate.”\n\nAnd Burchett told reporters that Trump “committed to me that he is going to go after the spending in a lot of these big departments” and that more generally Republicans are “going in the right direction.”\n\n“It’s not everything I wanted, but in this game, you’re either at the table or on the menu,” he said. “It’s time to get at the table.”\n\nOnly Massie remained unconvinced.\n\nMeanwhile, a different faction of the GOP conference — moderate Republicans, many representing swing districts — had aired qualms about the scale of the Medicaid cuts implied by the budget plan.\n\nThat group, however, quickly softened: On Monday night, some said that a presentation from House leaders had moved them closer to supporting the budget plan, and by midday Tuesday, House leaders were confident enough to move toward a final vote.\n\nAfter it was all over, top Democratic leaders said Republicans had betrayed Americans by advancing a plan that they said would cut taxes for the richest while cutting benefits for the poor and middle class.\n\n“They chose their billionaire puppet masters over the American people,” said Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. “Democrats were unified, and we will remain unified throughout this process, because this reckless Republican budget will bring nothing but destruction to the American people.”\n\nSeveral Democrats who have faced health challenges and missed recent House votes rushed back to Washington for the budget showdown. That forced Johnson to scrounge up every vote he could.\n\nTuesday’s vote sets up a harsh reality check between House and Senate Republicans, who all want to push the president’s agenda forward but still have profoundly different approaches to key issues.\n\nThe Senate, for instance, is looking to avoid the deep cuts to Medicaid that the House is leaning on for significant cost cutting. Senate Republicans are also insisting that they won’t support a final measure that only extends Trump’s 2017 tax cuts temporarily. That could require making significant changes to the House blueprint, putting the fragile GOP support for the measure in jeopardy.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune congratulated the House GOP “for moving our team one step closer to advancing the president’s agenda” while also calling for a permanent extension to the Trump tax cuts — a goal that will be difficult to carry out under the House budget plan.\n\nThe House and Senate must adopt identical budget resolutions to unlock the power of reconciliation — which allows parties with unified control of Congress and the White House to pass massive policy bills along party lines, sidestepping the Senate filibuster.",

        "full_text": "Republican lawmakers are sounding the alarm over the Trump administration’s pointed refusal to blame Russia for starting the war in Ukraine, and they are highly skeptical about negotiating any lasting peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom some describe as a war criminal.\n\nThe Republican criticism of President Trump’s strategy for ending the war in Ukraine comes after the United States voted with Russia and its allies, such as North Korea and Belarus, against a United Nations resolution condemning Russian aggression toward Ukraine and calling for the withdrawal of its troops from the country.\n\nWhile GOP senators were willing to grant Trump broad deference on his controversial Cabinet nominees, they are doubling down in blaming Russia for starting the war and warning the president to approach Putin warily in any negotiation.\n\nSenate Appropriations Committee Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) blasted the American opposition to the U.N. resolution condemning Russian aggression.\n\n“Yesterday’s vote by the U.S. against the U.N. resolution was shameful,” she said Tuesday.\n\nThe measure, which received the backing of NATO allies, passed the U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly despite the U.S. opposition.\n\nThe United States instead backed a resolution that called for immediate peace in Ukraine but made no mention of Russia’s invasion for starting the conflict.\n\nCollins said she agreed with Sen. Mitch McConnell’s (R-Ky.) statement marking the third anniversary of the war, in which the former Senate GOP leader said refusing to blame Russia “as the undeniable and unprovoked aggressor” in the conflict “reflects a gross misunderstanding of the nature of negotiations and leverage.”\n\nSen. John Curtis (R-Utah) said he was “deeply troubled” that the U.S. voted Monday with Russia and North Korea and against traditional allies such as Britain and France, which supported the resolution condemning Russia and calling for a restoration of Ukraine’s borders.\n\n“I was deeply troubled by the vote at the UN today, which puts us on the same side as Russia and North Korea. These are not our friends. This posture is a dramatic shift from American ideals of freedom and democracy,” Curtis said in a post on social media.\n\nHe warned that any end to the war “must be achieved on terms that ensure Ukraine’s sovereignty and security” and “deter” Putin from future territorial aggression.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) on Tuesday marked the third anniversary of Russia’s “unprovoked war on Ukraine.”\n\n“We all want this senseless war to end, but ending it on Russia’s terms would be a devastating mistake that plays right into Putin’s bloody hands,” Murkowski posted on social media.\n\nShe later noted Trump has “the authority” to pursue a peace deal but warned that any such deal would be “unacceptable” if Putin sets the terms.\n\n“The president clearly has the ability, has the authority to be negotiating. But I think many of us have suggested that negotiating peace on Putin’s terms is not acceptable,” she told reporters.\n\nSome of the strongest pushback in the conference came from McConnell, who now leads the Senate’s Appropriations defense subcommittee.\n\n“America is right to seek an end to this war, but an end that fails to constrain Russian ambition, ensure Ukrainian sovereignty or strengthen American credibility with both allies and adversaries is no end at all. Instead, such a hollow peace would invite further aggression,” he said in a statement Monday.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said he “disagreed” with the U.S. vote against the resolution condemning Russian aggression.\n\n“Putin is a murderer who’s ordered the systematic capture, kidnapping, rape and torture of countless numbers of Ukrainians,” he said. “That would have been my vote recommendation.”\n\nHe argued Putin can’t be trusted to uphold any peace deal, a warning echoed by other GOP lawmakers.\n\n“Putin’s a liar and looking for the next opportunity to continue [Russia’s] march through Moldova and the west Balkans and everything else,” he warned.\n\nSen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he was “trying to understand” why the administration would oppose a resolution condemning Russia for the war.\n\n“I’m trying to understand the negotiating strategy. I can imagine this was a strategic vote in order to negotiate a hasty and expeditious outcome to a horrible war,” he said. “I will withhold judgment or further comment until I learn more about that.”\n\nBut he said there’s no question that Russia is the aggressor in the war.\n\n“I agree that Russia is the aggressor. I’m acknowledging it, and so many members of Congress are acknowledging that,” he said.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), speaking on the Senate floor, said Trump’s refusal to call out Putin as the aggressor has undermined U.S. leverage heading into the peace talks.\n\n“The United States should have been willing to say this was an illegal war unjustly initiated by Russia. If you’re unwilling to state a truth, you begin in a very weak position,” he warned.\n\nOther Republican senators pushed back on the reluctance of some high-ranking Trump administration officials to blame Russia for sparking the conflict three years ago.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth in a “Fox News Sunday” interview told host Shannon Bream “it’s a very complicated question” when asked if it would be fair to say Russia attacked Ukraine without provocation.\n\nOn Tuesday, Stephen Feinberg, the co-founder of Cerberus Capital Management whom Trump has nominated to serve as the Pentagon’s No. 2-ranking official, declined to assign blame to Russia during his Senate confirmation hearing.\n\n“I don’t feel that I should publicly comment in the middle of tense negotiations when I’m not privy to the facts,” he said when asked by Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) to confirm that Russia indeed invaded its neighbor.\n\nTrump last week suggested Ukraine was primarily responsible for the war but later walked back his comment.\n\nThe president said last week that Ukraine “should have never started the war” but later modified his statement by acknowledging “Russia attacked.”\n\nTrump stirred some concern among defense hawk Republicans by refusing to call Putin a dictator when asked Monday about his comments last week calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a “dictator without elections.”\n\n“I don’t use those words lightly,” he said when asked whether he views Putin as a dictator.\n\nSeveral Republican senators Tuesday, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.), avowed that Russia is solely to blame for the conflict.\n\n“We’re not confused about the facts. That is a fact,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said.\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) said “Russia’s clearly the aggressor.”\n\nHe pointed to quote from the 1946 Nuremberg Trials International Military Tribunal he had posted on social media in response to the U.S. voting against the U.N. resolution condemning Russia.\n\n“To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole,” it read.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a close Trump ally and prominent voice on national security issues, said “Russia is the aggressor.”\n\nSenate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) last week rejected Trump’s lenient view of Putin, telling CNN in an interview that the Russian president is a “war criminal who should be in jail for life.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Wicker told CNN that “it’s clear to most Americans that this war was started by Vladimir Putin’s aggression” dating back as far as 2014, when Russia invaded and seized Crimea.\n\n“It seems to me that multiple administrations have not been as firm as we should have been,” he said.",

        "full_text": "Socialism is popular!\n\nA Pew study reports that more than a third of American adults view it positively.\n\nHow is this possible?\n\nLittle has brought more misery -- first in the Soviet Union, then in China, Cuba, Nicaragua, now Venezuela ...\n\nOne reason young people support socialism is because their social media feeds show videos made by popular but economically illiterate people.\n\nTikTok star Madeline Pendleton has 1.6 million subscribers. My new video shows her telling them: \"Socialism is working better than capitalism 93% of the time!\"\n\nWhere does she get 93%?\n\nFrom a study published in 1986 by self-described Marxists in the Journal of Health Services.\n\nThe authors conveniently ignore the United States and other wealthy countries and compare socialist economies to \"capitalist\" countries like Uganda, Rwanda, and Somalia, some of which were at war.\n\nIt's so stupid. But based on that, Pendleton tells her followers, \"We have all the data showing that socialism does work.\"\n\nShe also celebrates communism because of its \"increased life expectancy.\"\n\nThat's nonsense, too. People live longest in capitalist countries like Japan (85 years) and South Korea (84 years). Even in the United States (79 years), where more of us die young because we drive more (car accidents), eat more, shoot each other more often, and try more dangerous drugs, we still live longer than people in China (78 years).\n\nSocialism is also superior, says Pendleton, because of \"the 90-100% home-ownership rates.\"\n\n\"One hundred percent,\" of course, is just dumb, but China (if you believe the party's statistics) does have 90% homeownership.\n\nBut not under socialism! They achieved that only after privatizing urban housing. Before 1998, when Chinese housing was still socialist, just 20% of Chinese people owned homes.\n\nSeveral social media stars rave about China. \"Socialism worked in China!\" says TikToker Dante Munoz. \"They lifted over 800 million people from poverty.\"\n\nAgain, it's true that in the last 50 years, China's GDP went from $156 per capita to more than $12,000. But that only happened after China gave up on real socialism and started embracing markets. Hong Kong, which adopted actual capitalism, raised per capita GDP to $50,000.\n\nBefore China reformed, millions of people died of starvation.\n\nAnother silly social media star, JT Chapman, tells his almost 2 million YouTube subscribers: \"The central idea that unites all socialists is maximizing freedom ... democratization of power.\"\n\nDemocratization? In most socialist countries, there's only one political party.\n\nA popular TikToker calling himself Rathbone tells his hundred thousand subscribers: \"capitalism ... prioritizes profits over people ... (but) socialism ... prioritizes people over profits.\"\n\nLikewise, Chapman says socialism offers the \"guaranteed right to ... health care, food and shelter.\"\n\nWell, socialism promises those things and claims to prioritize people over profits, but what people actually get is different.\n\nAs Cuban doctors put it in this video, \"The Cuban health care system is destroyed ... People are dying in the hallways.\"\n\nYet Chapman claims, \"Innovation can flourish even when people are not motivated by profit. The USSR gave the world the anthrax vaccine, artificial satellites and one of the earliest mobile phones.\"\n\nThat is true. But no one uses those phones today. Capitalism just creates much more.\n\nFinally, Chapman says, \"Ownership should be collective.\"\n\nCollective ownership does feel good. \"We'll share everything!\"\n\nBut every attempt at collective ownership has failed.\n\nOne famous American example: 200 years ago, New Harmony, Indiana, abolished private property, promising a \"community of equality.\"\n\nThe result was famine.\n\nWhen people realized they could receive just as much barely working as they could working hard, many, naturally, worked less. Within a year, the commune experiment failed, and the property was returned to private hands.\n\nWhat do these popular social media stars say when I confront them with these inconvenient truths? Sadly, I don't know. Not one would appear on Stossel TV to debate.\n\nThe bottom line: Incentives matter. No one washes a rental car. Few people care much about what belongs to everyone. It's just human nature.\n\nCapitalism isn't perfect, but if we want a better future and freedom, capitalism is the only thing that works.\n\nEvery Tuesday at JohnStossel.com, Stossel posts a new video about the battle between government and freedom.",

Share Copy Link ✓ Link copied to clipboard! Texas Representative Dan Crenshaw and conservative commentator Tucker Carlson are again at odds after Crenshaw was caught on a hot mic making a controversial remark about Carlson on Monday. The incident has ignited anger among some viewers and sparked interest in the long-standing tensions between the two figures, who have clashed repeatedly over political issues and personal criticisms. What Did Dan Crenshaw Say About Tucker Carlson? During a recent event in Texas, Crenshaw was allegedly overheard saying, \"I'd kill that guy if I had the chance,\" referring to Carlson. The comment came after Crenshaw was interviewed by GB News reporter Steven Edginton. During the chat scheduled for broadcast, Crenshaw had criticized Carlson's stance on Ukraine . Rep.

Graeme Sloan/Sipa USA The duo moved away from the set, but their microphones remained on. Edginton asked Crenshaw: \"Have you ever met Tucker?\" He replied: \"We've talked a lot. On Twitter . If I ever meet him, I'll f****** kill him.\" Crenshaw then added: \"I'm not joking. He's the worst person.\" The comment quickly went viral and sparked widespread criticism, particularly from viewers who support Donald Trump and MAGA. Crenshaw appeared to clarify his remarks later on X, formerly Twitter. Georgia Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene tagged Crenshaw and asked if he threatened to kill Carlson. The congressman denied it, writing, \"lol, no.\" Carlson responded to the incident on X by inviting the congressman for an interview. \"Why don't you come sit for an interview and we'll see how you do? I'll send you my address,\" Carlson wrote. Who Is Dan Crenshaw? Dan Crenshaw is a U.S. representative representing Texas' 2nd congressional district. A former Navy SEAL who lost his right eye during an explosion in Afghanistan, he medically retired in September 2016 as a lieutenant commander after serving 10 years in the SEAL teams. He serves on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Committee. He married his wife Tara in 2013, and they have one daughter. Crenshaw's military service earned him respect among veterans and conservatives. His memoir, Fortitude: American Resilience in the Era of Outrage , emphasizes the importance of mental resilience. Is Dan Crenshaw A Democrat Or A Republican? Dan Crenshaw is a member of the Republican Party . First elected to Congress in 2018, he has aligned himself with traditional conservative values, advocating for a strong national defense, limited government and free-market principles.

Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images Dan Crenshaw And Tucker Carlson's Relationship Explained The feud between Crenshaw and Carlson dates back several years and is rooted in their differing approaches to conservative politics. Carlson, a former Fox News host, has criticized Crenshaw over the representative's support for U.S. military aid to Ukraine in its war against Russia. The duo has targeted one another on social media. Per Politico, Carlson once mocked Crenshaw as one of \"the dumbest\" Republicans . Crenshaw had called Carlson a \"cowardly, know-nothing elitist.\" One notable clash occurred in 2022, when Carlson questioned Crenshaw's support for U.S. military aid to Ukraine, referring to him as \"Eyepatch McCain\"—a reference to the late Senator John McCain , known for his hawkish foreign policy. Crenshaw condemned the comment as disrespectful to wounded veterans and accused Carlson of prioritizing entertainment over serious political discourse. Carlson also targeted Crenshaw last year concerning the bill placing restrictions on the social media platform TikTok , owned by Chinese company ByteDance. On March 15, 2024, Carlson shared a clip on X of Crenshaw outside the U.S. Capitol, speaking about privacy and data protection. Carlson wrote: \"Crenshaw tells reporter Liam Cosgrove that U.S. intel agencies don't meddle in domestic news coverage, when of course he knows that's untrue. Watch his face as he says it. Liar.\" Despite their public disagreements, both figures continue to wield significant influence within conservative circles. fairness meter fairness meter Newsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.

        "full_text": "In 2023, US imports under AGOA topped $9.7 billion, down from $10.2 billion the previous year. The arrangement, which allows eligible African countries and businesses to export goods to the US under favorable tariff-free terms, was dominated that year by $4.2 billion in crude oil trade. It also included around $1.1 billion in apparel and over $900 million in agricultural products.\n\nThe US Congress is responsible for approving the next iteration of the act, which has typically commanded bipartisan support. But there is uncertainty about its future this time around, not least because of the tone of the debates around free trade in Washington. Trump’s “America First Trade Policy” executive order on Jan. 20 has called on the US Trade Representative, the Treasury department, and the Commerce department to review all United States trade deals. Some analysts are awaiting the outcome of that review on April 1 to determine AGOA’s future.\n\nAD\n\n“The idea of a preferential trade deal is a difficult one in the current environment. And given the executive order, it leaves a question mark on AGOA’s future,” said Frannie Léautier, who authored an Atlantic Council report in 2023 calling for AGOA’s early renewal. It could boil down to making a practical case in AGOA’s favor, showing that tariffs are more costly than preferential trade for US companies. “That might help,” said Léautier.\n\nThe uncertainty around AGOA is surprising because while there are differences of opinion around technical details, the trade act has always received bipartisan support in Congress and from White House administrations of either stripe.\n\nEven Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, which is broadly believed to be a rough blueprint for Trump’s policy approach, offered fairly standard language about AGOA ahead of last November’s election.\n\nAD\n\nBut AGOA seems to have been caught up in the shock and awe furor around the dismantling of USAID and no one is certain anymore what might happen. “I don’t know” was the most common response I got in recent days when I spoke to Africa analysts and Congress aides. A few months earlier it was “when” not “if.”\n\nTo be clear, while AGOA has had some wins, it has not been the kind of rip-roaring success that has driven African imports to grow exponentially every year. The $9.7 billion AGOA imports to the US last year was a miserly share of the $3.9 trillion of global US imports.\n\nAnd yet, even in this Trump 2.0-era of Washington upheaval, there is an optimistic take that’s beginning to crystallize. This is that forcing AGOA to be seen as a transactional opportunity for the US as much as for Africa will help break the program away from its development partnership roots. If successful, the optimistic view is it could finally start to be transformative for more African countries.\n\nSouth Africa has been in the eye of the storm with regards to US relations in recent weeks in a range of sensitive geopolitical and domestic policy issues. AGOA came into focus as one of the levers that might be used against South Africa when four US congressmen called for its eligibility to be revoked.\n\nThis is particularly significant because South Africa, the continent’s most industrialized economy, is the largest beneficiary of the free trade program through which it exports cars, citrus fruits, wine, and textiles worth nearly $2 billion annually to the US.\n\nNeil Diamond, president of the South African Chamber of Commerce in the US, told Semafor: “The biggest immediate concern is uncertainty, which discourages investment, disrupts supply chains, and forces businesses to consider alternative markets.”",

        "full_text": "House Republicans hunting for ways to pay for President Trump’s tax cuts have called for cutting the federal government’s share of Medicaid spending, including a proposal that would effectively gut the Affordable Care Act’s 2014 expansion of the program.\n\nCutting Medicaid spending, which is expected to be central to fulfilling the budget plan that House Republicans adopted Tuesday night, could result in millions of Americans across the country losing health coverage unless states decide to play a bigger role in its funding.\n\nFederal and state governments share the costs of Medicaid, which is a public health insurance program largely for low-income people.\n\nRepublicans are considering lowering the 90 percent share that the federal government is required to pay to states that enroll participants in the expansion. The change could generate $560 billion in savings over a decade, money that Republicans want to use toward extending Mr. Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, which are set to expire at the end of 2025. Extending the tax cuts is expected to cost $4.5 trillion, meaning Republicans will have to find savings beyond Medicaid from a long menu of options.\n\nA move to lower federal spending on the Medicaid expansion population could effectively gut the program. Around 10 states that have expanded their programs have so-called trigger laws that reverse the Medicaid expansion if the federal government decreases funding for the population.\n\nThe change could leave the 40 states that participate in the Obamacare program with a difficult set of choices. They could shoulder the extra costs to preserve Medicaid coverage for millions, make cuts to coverage or look for cuts from other large government programs to offset the reduction in federal funds.\n\nMedicaid, which covers more than 70 million people, is the largest health insurance program in the nation, and the largest single source of funding for states. More than 21 million adults who were not eligible for Medicaid under pre-expansion guidelines received coverage last year. The program had previously restricted enrollment primarily to those who were pregnant, disabled or elderly.\n\nAmong those who qualified for Medicaid under the expansion was Jeannie Brown, a 60-year-old part-time bus driver for the public school system in Belgrade, Mont. Ms. Brown went more than five years without health insurance beginning in 2009, avoiding medical care as her health deteriorated and she cared for her disabled granddaughter.\n\nMs. Brown, who makes around $25,000 each year, had been trapped in the so-called coverage gap, with a salary too high for Medicaid, and too low for a heavily subsidized Obamacare plan.\n\nAfter Montana lawmakers voted in 2015 to take up the Affordable Care Act’s option to expand Medicaid to cover more adults, Ms. Brown enrolled. She began to see a primary care doctor, and Medicaid paid for hand surgeries, knee replacements, a double mastectomy and her inhaler, she said.\n\n“Being a caregiver is extremely exhausting, especially with someone who has a lot of health needs,” she said last week from a children’s hospital in Colorado, where her granddaughter had been flown for emergency care. “If I didn’t have the preventative care I needed, I’d be in a much worse place physically. I’d probably be disabled.”\n\nConservative critics of Medicaid expansion have argued that it forces the federal government to spend exorbitantly, and disproportionately, to cover health services for a population Medicaid was not intended to serve.\n\n“The higher federal match for able-bodied adults creates perverse incentives to divert funds from more vulnerable populations,” said Michael Cannon, the director of health policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.\n\nRepublicans have also pointed to what they say is unanticipated runaway Medicaid spending. Some states have seen unexpected surges in Medicaid costs in recent years, in part because many Americans delayed care during the coronavirus pandemic. Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, recently proposed a $2.5 billion increase in state spending on the program.\n\nThe move to pare back the federal government’s financial commitments to Medicaid could profoundly reshape how it shares responsibility with states to offer health care to some of the poorest Americans, as well as the providers and nursing homes that care for them.\n\nThe change would amount to a “massive transfer of the financial responsibility from the federal government to states,” said Daniel Tsai, who oversaw Medicaid under former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\n“You’d have states having enormous budget holes making decisions between how to do the right thing to keep people covered” and how to preserve other programs, he said. “States are going to be cash strapped.”\n\nMedicaid expansion has become a deeply bipartisan project over the past decade, underscoring the Affordable Care Act’s reach in the American health system and its appeal even to Republican governors and state lawmakers who once opposed it. Much of the additional enrollment comes from Republican-led states where voters passed ballot initiatives to enact the program.\n\nMedicaid now funds almost half of all births in the United States, and represents more than half of spending on long-term care. More than 70 percent of Americans say they want Medicaid to stay as it is, according to a survey conducted last year by KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group.\n\nSenator Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told HuffPost last week that he had filed an amendment to a Senate budget resolution prohibiting cuts from Medicaid. After his state expanded the program in 2021, more than 300,000 low-income residents joined the rolls.\n\nRepresentative Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican, said on Sunday that lawmakers may focus on imposing a national work requirement on Medicaid, a controversial proposal that would amount to only a fraction of the cuts congressional Republicans are seeking. Ohio recently asked the Trump administration for permission to test out the policy.\n\nJon Tester, the former Democratic senator from Montana, said that Medicaid cuts could have a more sweeping effect on rural America than urban areas because of how the program sustains impoverished areas with few health providers. “And that’s an interesting conundrum because most of rural America is a much deeper red than urban America,” he said.\n\n“If you take away health care, you can’t live there,” Mr. Tester said.\n\nRepublicans are also considering limiting how much the federal government spends on a state’s Medicaid program, a practice known as block granting or per capita caps. That strategy could save as much as $900 billion over a decade.\n\nIf states picked up the costs from the federal government and kept their expansion populations in place, they would spend more than $600 billion to do so over a decade, an increase of almost 20 percent, according to KFF. Many states would be short more than $10 billion over a decade, and some larger states, such as New York and California, would face a shortfall of more than $50 billion.\n\nWith Montana’s expansion program set to expire in June, a group of state lawmakers there advanced legislation last week that would extend the program, in part to keep health providers in the heavily rural state solvent. Roughly 80,000 people in the state now have coverage through the state’s expansion, drastically lowering the state’s uninsured rate.\n\nBut like in other states, Montana’s Medicaid expansion has been preserved in part because of strong Republican support in the state Legislature. One Republican state senator in favor of Medicaid expansion, Russ Tempel, said that it had increased behavioral health services in the state and was keeping the few hospitals in his rural district afloat.\n\nMatt Regier, the Republican president of the Montana Senate, said that hospitals in the state had become too reliant on Medicaid, and that its expansion was “incentivizing people to not stand on their own two feet.”\n\n“That’s the opposite of what a government safety net should be,” he said.\n\nIn Illinois, another state with a trigger law, roughly a quarter of the state’s Medicaid program is part of the expansion population, and the state’s uninsured rate dropped by 44 percent after the expansion took effect, said Alex Gough, a spokesman for Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat. The state receives more than $7 billion for that group, Mr. Gough added.\n\n“Threats to coverage would spell catastrophe,” he said. He added that eliminating the Medicaid expansion “would cause major disruption to the state’s health care infrastructure that relies on Medicaid funding and, ultimately, its economy.”\n\nDemocratic legislators in Virginia are trying to protect Medicaid by getting rid of the trigger provision. State officials are also girding for a new wave of enrollment from laid-off federal workers.\n\n“I’m not confident Virginia would be able to provide full coverage” with drastically lower federal funding, said Ghazala Hashmi, a Democratic state senator who has proposed a new committee to study the issue. “That is not a burden a state budget could bear.”",

Share Copy Link ✓ Link copied to clipboard! Something is fundamentally broken in America. And you can get a hint of it in the way Americans think about and interact with news about the world. Especially news about politics. A fascinating new study from public opinion firm Change Research puts its finger on the problem: \"navigating a sea of bias, sensationalism, and misinformation exhausts and annoys significant portions of voters.\" The researchers show that it's this basic aggravation with the way we get information that is at the core of a lot of voter behavior. Americans have grown weary; not just of the news, but also of the entire miserable chore of learning about it. Which explains the stunning statistic that the share of Americans saying they closely follow news dropped 13 points in the past eight years, and that today, only one-third of us pay any real attention to the world around us. Like singles on a dating app wading through a sea of creeps, duds, and weirdos until they quiet-quit the dating pool out of sheer exasperation, people are opting out of news out of frustrated fatigue. Pedestrians walk past a newspaper vending machine as it lies next to the PNI Building, which housed the Philadelphia Inquirer in 2006 in Philadelphia. Pedestrians walk past a newspaper vending machine as it lies next to the PNI Building, which housed the Philadelphia Inquirer in 2006 in Philadelphia. William Thomas Cain/Getty Images Except that when Americans swipe left on current events, the consequences are a lot more disastrous . President Donald Trump actually won the last election only because so few voters were paying attention: voters who said they barely follow news favored him by 19 points in 2024; those who follow news \"a great deal\" favored Vice President Kamala Harris by 6. Those Americans seeing the past month of chaos , rising prices, surrender to our enemies, and the trail of death and disease that Trump has created might be screaming, like Adam Sandler in The Wedding Singer , that they wish all of this had been brought to their attention yesterday... as in, before the election. Except it was. Anyone taking even a little bit of interest knew this was coming. As voters in a republic who are supposed exercise self-determination, that's on us. Mostly. But it's also on the media. Because they're the ones who are supposed to help the citizenry make informed decisions so that we can govern ourselves. And they're the ones that have made reading news feel like jumping into the trash compactor in Star Wars : wading through muck, waiting for some cyclopean alien eel to jump out and drown you. What a wonderful smell we've discovered. Read more The Presidential Power Grab That Should Terrify Every American | Opinion With McConnell Retiring, the Old GOP Is Gone for Good | Opinion Trump's Hate for the FCPA Isn't About \"Government Efficiency\" | Opinion Is there any way out of the cesspool? It depends on whether media organizations figure out the secret. What they need to see is that the thing that is ultimately broken in America is trust. Stacks of research show that trust in institutions has been cratering and news media are among the biggest losers in the great American confidence die-off. But there are a few clever media entities that are thriving right now, and it's highly likely that a major reason is that they've recognized ways to address some of the root causes —perceptions of bias, sensationalism, misinformation, and financial motivations—behind people's loss of faith. For example, the Philadelphia Inquirer is tackling reader skepticism of media motivations by leaning into their not-for-profit ownership as a contrast to their competitors. They've successfully branded themselves as a paper that's more willing to shoot straight with readers because they're less driven by the balance sheet. That differentiation directly attacks one of the biggest sources of loss of reader trust—the feeling that what they're reading is dripping with sensationalism. Articles look less like click-bait if the newspaper doesn't seem like it has quite the same need to chase clicks. Substack is following a different trust-based model, and it's clearly resonating . It allows subscribers to develop a direct, social media-like connection with creators, so they can feel like they are getting more unvarnished analysis with less suspicion of platform owner bias. Creators also often mix the DIY Substack vibe with the name-brand professionalism of big-name-media by straddling both worlds. The smarter media outlets have seen this as a good thing, a win-win way to build greater reader trust for themselves by tapping into the creators' direct audience connection. Both of us are becoming such straddlers, and one of us (Schecter), a former Daily Beast columnist, is literally starting his own Substack right now (feel free to come give feedback on this article in his 12-hour livestream happening today, or hit Robison's ). To be sure, this list is neither complete nor perfect, and these steps are necessary but may not be sufficient. But the take-home is clear: if news media is going to reverse the tune-out trend—which is something this country desperately needs—the table stakes are being much clearer about getting biases out in the open and helping people feel like they at least know what they're getting. And they can't just hope that it will happen; Walter Cronkite ain't walking through that door, so they've got to work for it... If they do, the marketplace may even reward them.

        "full_text": "The U.S. Supreme Court temporarily delayed a court-mandated deadline requiring the Trump administration to pay nearly $2 billion to contracted aid organizations for work they already completed.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, in an order Wednesday night, stayed a lower court order that the administration pay out $1.9 billion by midnight. In his order, Roberts asked the aid groups that sued the Trump administration to provide a response by noon Friday after which the court will decide its next steps.\n\nRoberts' order came after the Trump administration sought emergency intervention by the high court after a panel of federal appeals court judges denied the administration's earlier request to push the deadline.\n\nActing Solicitor General Sarah Harris asked the justices to impose an administrative stay -- freezing the status quo for a short time.\n\n\"What the government cannot do is pay arbitrarily determined demands on an arbitrary timeline of the district court’s choosing or according to extra-contractual rules that the court has devised,\" Harris wrote in the emergency request, saying the deadline created \"an untenable payment plan\" at odds with the president's obligations.\n\n\"The order appears to contemplate the immediate outlay of nearly $2 billion. And the government has no sure mechanism to recover wrongfully disbursed funds delivered to entities that claim to be near insolvency,\" Harris said in the request.\n\nIn proceedings earlier Wednesday denying a request to stay his deadline, U.S. District Court Judge Amir Ali, a Biden-era appointee, balked at the government's insistence that it couldn't meet the midnight payout deadline and criticized the Trump administration for waiting until Tuesday to raise the argument that they lack the ability to restart the funding.\n\n\"This is not something that Defendants have previously raised in this Court, whether at the hearing or any time before filing their notice of appeal and seeking a stay pending appeal. That is so even though Plaintiffs' motion to enforce explicitly proposed compliance on this time frame,\" Ali wrote.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ali had ordered the Trump administration to dole out delayed payments that could total nearly $2 billion, according to a USAID official, to multiple nonprofit groups, determining the Trump administration violated the terms of a temporary restraining order issued two weeks ago regarding freezing foreign aid.\n\nA top official with the United States Agency for International Development claimed that complying with Tuesday's court order would require paying foreign aid groups nearly $2 billion, arguing the payments \"cannot be accomplished\" in the timeframe set by the court.\n\nLawyers with the Department of Justice asked Ali in a late-night filing on Tuesday to issue a stay of his order that requires the Trump administration to pay by Wednesday at 11:59 p.m. any outstanding debts to foreign aid groups for work completed prior to Feb. 13. The Trump administration initially tried to freeze the payments via an executive order before Judge Ali ordered the payments to resume two weeks ago.\n\nDOJ lawyers argued that fulfilling the payments is not only technically impossible but would also prevent the Trump administration from ensuring the payments are \"legitimate.\"\n\n\"The order apparently requires the Government to expend taxpayer dollars without regard to any processes for ensuring that the expenses are legitimate—even though Executive Branch leadership harbors concerns about the possibility of waste and fraud and is in the process of developing revised payment processing systems to address those concerns,\" DOJ attorney Indraneel Sur wrote in a late-night filing.\n\nAccording to Peter Marocco, the deputy administrator of USAID and director of foreign assistance at the State Department, complying with the court order would require dispersing $1.5 billion between 2,000 payment requests at USAID and an additional $400 million in payments at the State Department.\n\nEarlier this week, Judge Ali excoriated Trump administration attorneys during a lengthy hearing over its failure to pay the groups for work they conducted prior to President Trump's Jan. 20 executive order, which froze all foreign aid for 90 days. Ali also signed an order to enforce a temporary restraining order he signed on Feb. 13, ruling the groups must be paid by 11:59 p.m. Wednesday.\n\n\"Plaintiffs submitted evidence that defendants have not lifted the suspension or freeze of funds as the [temporary restraining order] required. Defendants have not rebutted that evidence, and when asked today, defendants were not able to provide any specific examples of unfreezing funds pursuant to the Court's TRO,\" Judge Ali said after a two-hour hearing today.\n\nLawyers with the Department of Justice acknowledged that the Trump administration ignored the temporary restraining order, which prohibited them from freezing foreign aid funds since the order was issued. Instead, they argued that they should not be required to pay back the money because of \"sovereign immunity.\"\n\nDuring an extended exchange with Ali, a DOJ lawyer struggled to answer basic questions about the Trump administration's compliance with the temporary restraining order, which prevented the administration from freezing funds.\n\n\"I'm not sure why I can't get a straight answer from you on this. Are you aware of an unfreezing of the disbursement of funds for those contracts and agreements that were frozen before February 13?\" Ali asked. \"Are you aware of steps taken to actually release those funds?\"\n\n\"I'm not in a position to answer that,\" DOJ attorney Indraneel Sur said.\n\n\"We're 12 days in and you're here representing the government...and you can't answer me whether any funds that you've kind of acknowledged or covered by the court's order have been unfrozen?\" Judge Ali responded.\n\n\"All I can do, really, is say that the preparations are underway for the joint status report on compliance,\" Sur said.\n\nAt one portion of the lengthy court hearing, Sur attempted to offer a legal justification for the Trump administration's noncompliance, prompting a stern response from the judge about his order, the terms of which he said were \"clear as day.\"\n\n\"The purpose of this hearing is to understand and to hear arguments on the motion to enforce TRO. It is not an opportunity to re-litigate the TRO,\" Ali said.\n\nA lawyer representing the nonprofits who brought the case argued that the lack of a response from the Trump administration amounts to defiance of the court order.\n\n\"What the court's colloquy with the government has revealed is that the government has done nothing to make the flow of payments happen,\" he said. \"As far as we are aware, there's been zero directives from the agency with respect to the unfreezing of funds.\"",

        "full_text": "In 2009, raucous town halls for Democratic members of Congress were a sign that Barack Obama’s “hope and change” agenda risked a public backlash. Now, it’s elected Republicans who star in viral-video town halls, as they parry complaints from an enraged crowd. Many of these complaints have focused on cuts to federal programmes as well as DOGE layoffs, and they have put some Republicans on the defensive. One Republican House member, for instance, told NBC News that he wanted to see more “compassion” from the administration going forward.\n\nTo some extent, town halls are political theatre, and progressive activists have recognised in them an opportunity to hold Republicans’ feet to the fire. But they are also part of a growing pool of evidence that the sweeping disruption of the first month of the Trump administration has started to generate some resistance. Elected in part out of dissatisfaction with the economy of the Joe Biden years, the new regime cannot afford to take its eye off kitchen-table issues.\n\nBeyond these town halls, some polling has raised red flags. While Trump remains more popular than during his first term (as well as considerably more popular than Biden in the closing year of his presidency), his numbers have dipped a bit over the first month of his presidency. Even more importantly, approval for his economic policies has also fallen in polling. A CNN poll published last week found that 51% of Americans thought the President had gone “too far” in cutting the federal government — and 62% believed that he was not doing enough to tackle inflation. Economic anxiety can be read in other measures, too. The consumer-confidence index dropped from January to February and remains well below where it was during most of Trump’s pre-pandemic presidency.\n\nIt’s obviously too early to judge the new administration’s economic programme, or to expect its agenda to have already had a major effect on inflation. But that polling does indicate where the public’s priorities lie. The Right-wing X echo chamber might delight in battles with the “deep state”, but the majority of swing voters turned to Trump in 2024 in part because of their warm memories of the economy during his first presidency. That gives him some goodwill now that he has resumed office, but it also means that voters expect him to deliver.\n\nTrump was partly able to take over the Republican Party almost a decade ago because of the unpopularity of the austerity agenda which had become ascendant during the Tea Party era. Voters consistently backed away from the GOP when its talk about “limited government” transformed into proposals to slash federal programmes, especially entitlements. Sweeping federal cuts today could actually revive the pains that austerity inflicted on Republican electoral prospects. If the cuts seem erratic and haphazard, public sentiment could turn quickly.\n\nDOGE’s allies insist that the growing US debt burden needs to be confronted. However, taking America’s fiscal challenges seriously only adds to the importance of not allowing administrative battles to get in the way of a bigger economic programme. Robust, broadly shared economic growth alleviates fiscal pressures and gives policymakers credibility when proposing bigger reforms. The last time that the United States tamed its deficit and took its debt burden on a long-term downward trajectory was in the late Nineties, when the go-go economy filled federal coffers and family bank accounts. For decades, recessions have caused a spike in deficit spending.",

        "full_text": "The ruling in Glossip v. Oklahoma overturns the conviction of a defendant who has spent more than two decades on death row and sends the case back for a new trial.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the majority and joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, highlighted the prosecution’s failure to correct false testimony from the state’s key witness, Justin Sneed.\n\n“Because the prosecution violated its constitutional obligations under Napue v. Illinois by knowingly allowing false testimony to go uncorrected, Mr. Glossip is entitled to a new trial,” Sotomayor wrote, referring to the error that took place in Glossip’s case at the state court level.\n\nThe majority opinion emphasized newly uncovered evidence that Sneed, who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and prescribed lithium, falsely testified that he had never seen a psychiatrist. Sotomayor noted that Oklahoma prosecutors not only knew this testimony was false but failed to correct it during Glossip’s trial — an omission that could have influenced the jury’s verdict given that Sneed’s testimony was the only direct link implicating Glossip in the 1997 murder of motel owner Barry Van Treese.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, who served on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overseeing Oklahoma cases, recused himself from the decision.\n\nIn dissent, Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito criticized the majority’s reliance on new evidence presented long after the trial, arguing that the false testimony was immaterial to the outcome. Thomas, joined by Alito and partially by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, contended that the defense failed to challenge Sneed’s testimony effectively during the trial and that the evidence against Glossip remained strong despite the inconsistencies.\n\nThomas said the majority “stretches the law at every turn to rule in his favor,” referring to Glossip. Barrett said she would not have ordered the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals to set aside Glossip’s conviction and that she would rather have corrected the state court’s “misstatement of Napue” and sent the case back for further proceedings.\n\nSUPREME COURT APPEARS DIVIDED OVER OKLAHOMA DEATH ROW APPEAL\n\nThe decision on Monday comes after years of legal challenges and a rare admission from Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, a Republican, who supported Glossip’s petition for a new trial after an independent investigation revealed withheld evidence and concerns about the integrity of the prosecution’s case.\n\nGlossip, who has spent over two decades on death row, now awaits a new trial in Oklahoma state court. The ruling marks a significant victory for death penalty reform advocates and raises fresh questions about prosecutorial conduct in capital cases.",

        "full_text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court refused Monday to hear a pair of cases from abortion opponents who say laws limiting anti-abortion demonstrations near clinics violate their First Amendment rights.\n\nThe majority did not explain their reasoning for turning down the appeals, as is typical, but two conservative justices, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, disagreed.\n\nThe cities said the laws were passed to address disturbing behavior from protesters outside of health care clinics. But anti-abortion activists said the measures violate free-speech rights and should be on their “deathbed” after the justices overturned Roe v. Wade and the nationwide right to abortion.\n\nOne case comes from Carbondale, Illinois, which is located near the state’s southern border and passed an ordinance after becoming a destination for patients from nearby states with abortion bans. The measure was quickly challenged in court, and has never been enforced. The city argued the appeal should be tossed because the ordinance was repealed shortly before abortion opponents went to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe other case is from New Jersey, where activist Jeryl Turco says she has approached women in Englewood for years to try to convince them not to have abortions. She says an 8-foot demonstration-free zone the city passed in 2014 in response to an aggressive group of protesters also wrongly kept her from approaching women.\n\nEnglewood argues that Turco has still been able to share her message outside of the immediate area near clinic entrances. Lower courts have ultimately upheld the ordinance, finding it isn’t a major First Amendment burden.\n\nBoth challengers pointed out that the high court struck down a Massachusetts law creating 35-foot demonstration free “buffer zones” around clinic doors in 2014. They say the Illinois and New Jersey laws should meet the same fate.\n\nBut cities say their rules are in line with a different Supreme Court decision from 2000, when the high court allowed a Colorado law to stand. It barred people from getting within 8 feet of others without permission in a 100-foot “bubble zone” around clinics.\n\nThomas said that case, known as Hill v. Colorado, was wrongly decided. In a dissent from the decision to decline the Illinois case, he said that the court wrongly treated it differently than other First Amendment cases because abortion was involved. “Hill has been seriously undermined, if not completely eroded, and our refusal to provide clarity is an abdication of our judicial duty,” he wrote.",

        "full_text": "Before the Trump administration closed USAID’s doors, the agency regularly routed funding to causes aligned with George Soros’ nonprofit empire, terrorists and drag queens.\n\nThe agency came under scrutiny from the new administration over failures to ensure transparency in its funding to organizations across the globe and concerns that the leadership was not responding to explicit policy directives from the State Department and the wider executive branch to align its programs with Trump policies and the U.S. national interest.\n\nIn recent days, the Trump administration identified USAID programs ranging from contraceptives for Afghanistan to LGBT diversity programs for European countries as clear evidence that foreign aid needed to be paused and reevaluated, a task that fell to the Rubio State Department.\n\nThe development agency for years also funneled money to several nonprofit groups that also received substantial backing from components of George Soros’ empire. Some previously came under scrutiny during the Obama administration for “democracy promotion” and judicial reform efforts in European countries that critics claimed promoted leftist politics.\n\nFor example, U.S. government spending records show that the East-West Management Institute, which is in part backed by Soros’ Open Society Foundations, received more than $260 million over the years in grants from USAID to, among other things, promote the rule of law in Georgia, strengthen civil society in Uganda, and advance Serbia’s accession talks with the European Union.\n\nThat same nonprofit group came under scrutiny during the Obama administration after Judicial Watch uncovered government records and communications showing that the East-West Management Institute’s “Justice for All” campaign in Albania received $9 million in funding from USAID.\n\nThe assistance concerned several GOP Senators, who sent a letter to the newly appointed Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in 2017, alleging the campaign funded by the U.S. government helped craft an Albanian judicial reform proposal that may “give the Prime Minister and left-of-center government full control over the judiciary.”\n\nThose same Senators also raised concerns about a similar Soros-backed program in neighboring Macedonia where they said a local affiliate called Foundation Open Society-Macedonia received backing from USAID through the Open Society Foundations and pushed “a progressive agenda.”\n\nOther Soros-backed organizations that received funding from both his Open Society Foundations network and USAID include the Anti-Corruption Action Center in Ukraine and Transparency International.\n\nAccording to the group's own records, the Anti-Corruption Action Center began receiving funding from USAID the same year the Maidan Revolution overthrew Ukraine’s elected, Russian-friendly President Viktor Yanukovych. The group, by its own admission, was heavily critical of Yanukovych’s government and ministers, which aligned with U.S. State Department policy at the time. During the 2014 Maidan Revolution, then-Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland visited Ukraine and was recorded on a leaked phone call discussing how the United States could influence the formation of a new government in Kyiv.\n\nGeorge Soros’ Open Society Foundations did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAfter temporarily shutting down USAID operation, the Trump administration defended the move, citing other left-wing causes that received funding grants from the agency. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt highlighted several when speaking with reporters on Monday, including $1.5 million for diversity measures in Serbia, $32,000 for a “transgender comic book” in Peru, and $70,000 for a DEI musical in Ireland.\n\nHouse Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Brian Mast, R-Fla., also flagged other examples of USAID funding, including $15 million for condoms sent to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and over $3 million for “being LGBTQ in the Caribbean.”\n\nThe government watchdog overseeing the agency also warned USAID’s leadership in a stinging January memo that it had created serious \"vulnerabilities\" by doling out billions of tax dollars to overseas countries and groups without fulling vetting for terrorists. That inspector general’s report also determined that USAID grants were being insufficiently monitored.\n\nIn one egregious example, a Syrian national was charged by the Justice Department last year for diverting more than $9 million worth of humanitarian aid paid for by USAID to a designated terrorist group affiliated with Al-Qaeda in Iraq.\n\nThe suspect, Mahmoud Al Hafyan, was the head of a Syrian nongovernmental organization that employed 160 individuals and was awarded $122 million by USAID between January 2015 and November 2018, according to the Justice Department. That money was designated to pay for food kits for Syrian refugees fleeing conflict zones.\n\nDuring this contract, the Justice Department alleges Al Hafyan worked with co-conspirators to funnel “millions” in food kits on the black market to the Al-Nusra Front, a local Al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria that is also designated a terrorist organization by the United States.\n\nThe USAID inspector general warned about the limits on the agency’s ability to monitor expenditures for programs in “nonpermissive” environments, like the conflict zones in Syria, meaning what happened there could happen in other places, like Ukraine or Gaza, where there are similar international or local organizations operating that are recipients of U.S. cash.",

        "full_text": "In early February, Texas health officials reported that measles was spreading among an insular religious community in Gaines County, Texas, where nearly 14 percent of schoolchildren have an exemption (granted in some states for reasons of conscience, including for religious beliefs) from the required childhood vaccinations. The disease has since been detected in a bordering New Mexico county. And this week, the case count grew to at least 124 people. Last year, the US saw 285 measles cases nationwide — the fourth-highest total since 2000.\n\nThe outbreak has escalated just as the US’s foremost vaccine skeptic, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has ascended as its top health care official. On February 26, the Texas health department reported the first death in the outbreak, an unvaccinated school-aged child.\n\nKennedy promises to probe the safety of childhood vaccines, and in his first actions as the new US Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary, Kennedy has already put vaccine advisory meetings on indefinite hold. He has helped cultivate a culture of skepticism toward medical science as the most prominent voice promoting a debunked link between childhood vaccinations and autism and other health issues — a view that corresponds to the re-emergence of measles over the past decade.\n\nKennedy is no longer an outside agitator but the government official ultimately responsible for squashing public health threats in the US.\n\nSo far, he has not commented on the Texas outbreak. But what happens next will be the first big test case for how Kennedy will lead the US health department during an active public health emergency.\n\nHow would the response to an outbreak normally look?\n\nWhen there is a disease outbreak that requires government action (i.e., not your standard sniffles), local governments are the first responders. County officials are typically the first to receive reports of a disease spreading and they will start ramping up testing and other kinds of surveillance to assess the situation.\n\nThat was what happened in Texas: One Gaines County school district reported the first measles to their local community in late January. Within a week, the Texas state government stepped up once the outbreak had climbed to six cases, and began providing support for the local response. That’s also typical: While local authorities are on the front line, the state provides technical expertise, they may offer funding for communication and interventions (such as vaccine drive-throughs), and they otherwise serve as the top authority on how the response should be handled.\n\nThe feds usually stay in the background with an outbreak the size of the current measles occurrence. They can offer expert or laboratory support, for example. But otherwise, they are supporting players, unless the outbreak poses a unique threat to the rest of the nation or becomes a large multi-state crisis. For now, the current outbreak is limited to a small geographical region, and the states appear well aligned on how to respond.\n\nBut it is possible that further spread could demand federal officials get more involved — a development that would be worth watching closely, given its new leadership.\n\nThe good news: So far, RFK Jr.’s HHS isn’t complicating the response.\n\nThe outbreak was already underway before Kennedy was confirmed and, though it’s easy to forget after the pandemic, local authorities are taking the lead as they should. Texas health officials — and their counterparts in New Mexico, now that cases have begun to spread there — have set up mobile vaccination and testing sites, encouraging unvaccinated people to get their shots now. Because local officials are among the community they serve, they may be considered more trustworthy (and in turn they can ultimately be more effective).\n\nIf those efforts are allowed to continue unencumbered, that will be a hopeful sign that the RFK Jr.-led health department will not actively sabotage public health efforts when there is an acute crisis underway. After some observers pointed out that the CDC measles tracker had not been with the new outbreak, the web page was refreshed on Friday with a pledge to continue updating it every Friday.\n\nSo far, there is no sign that local officials have requested support from the federal government and been denied it.\n\nShould I be worried about measles spreading more widely?\n\nNot exactly. Such outbreaks are still relatively rare and, when they do occur, they usually stay localized. But America is trending in the wrong direction when it comes to this ancient disease, which can cause painful skin rashes and be deadly for young unvaccinated children.\n\nThe US declared measles eliminated in 2000. But it has regained a foothold as vaccination rates have dropped. In 2019, there was the largest outbreak in decades when more than 1,200 people became ill, mostly in New York. Now more than 120 individuals are sick along the border of Texas and New Mexico — larger than any outbreak last year and it is still only February.\n\nNationally, the measles vaccination rate has slipped just below the 95 percent target that experts say is necessary to maintain population-level immunity. In some states, the situation is more dire: 14 states had vaccination rates below 90 percent for the 2023–2024 school year, per the health policy think tank KFF.\n\nBut in individual communities, rates can slip even lower, creating the right conditions for an outbreak to explode; measles, after all, is one of the most contagious diseases known to man. In the Gaines County school district most affected by the outbreak, the vaccination rate is under 50 percent.\n\nThe vast majority of Americans still believe the measles vaccine is safe and effective, and its benefits outweigh any risks. But as our collective faith in science deteriorates, vaccination rates are also declining.\n\nUpdate, February 26, 11:20 am ET: This story has been updated to include the first death of a child who contracted measles in the Texas outbreak.",

        "full_text": "Key events\n\nShow key events only\n\nPlease turn on JavaScript to use this feature\n\nClosing summary\n\nOur live coverage is ending now. In the meantime, you can find all of our live US politics coverage here. Here is a summary of the key developments from today:\n\nA Trump-forward budget proposal imperiling Medicaid narrowly passed in the Republican-led House. The budget plan includes an estimated $800bn in potential cuts from Medicaid, a federal program providing healthcare coverage to more than 72 million Americans. The resolution also includes a $4.5tn in tax cuts and increased funding for defense and border security, offset by $2tn in spending reductions over the next decade.\n\nNearly 6,000 veterans have been fired across the federal government since the start of Donald Trump’s term, according to a new analysis by House Democrats. The report, compiled from data provided by the office of personnel management, estimates that roughly 38,000 federal workers have been fired since Trump took office last month and empowered Elon Musk’s ‘efficiency’ agency to dramatically reduce the federal workforce.\n\nTrump has said that Volodymyr Zelenskyy is likely to visit the White House on Friday to sign a rare earth minerals deal to pay for US military aid to defend against Russia’s full-scale invasion. The announcement followed days of tense negotiations between the US and Ukraine in which Zelenskyy alleged the US was pressuring him to sign a deal worth more than $500bn that would force “ten generations” of Ukrainians to pay it back.\n\nTrump reinstated a rule requiring cost transparency in healthcare. The rule requires hospitals to publish online the prices for some of their most common services, including MRI scans and caesarean section deliveries. The lack of transparency has often left patients shocked by medical bills.\n\nTrump signed an executive order instructing the commerce secretary to launch an investigation into whether foreign copper production and imports threaten US economic and national security. According to White House officials, the investigation could lead to new tariffs on foreign copper, a material essential to manufacturing and construction, as well as critical to the US military and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence.\n\n‘More than one million’ federal workers have responded to Elon Musk/Doge’s ultimatum email, the White House has claimed. Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, also said agency heads will “determine the best practices” for dealing with the ‘what did you do last week’ email in terms of whether people should respond and who, if anyone, would get fired. NBC News reported that responses to the email will reportedly be fed into an artificial intelligence system to determine whether their jobs are necessary.\n\nIn a significant shift of journalistic power, the White House press team will now decide which journalists and media outlets will make up the White House press pool. Leavitt said legacy outlets will still be allowed to join and participate in the press pool, but the “privilege” will also be extended to “new voices” from “well-deserving outlets”. It builds on the decision to revoke the Associated Press’s full access to presidential events over its continued use of “Gulf of Mexico” as opposed to “Gulf of America”.\n\nSome 40% of the federal contracts the Trump administration claims to have canceled as part of its signature cost-cutting program aren’t expected to save the government any money, the administration’s own data shows. Doge last week published an initial list of 1,125 contracts that it terminated in recent weeks across the federal government. Data published on Doge’s “wall of receipts” shows that more than one-third of the contract cancellations, 417 in all, are expected to yield no savings.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 20 civil service employees resigned from Doge, saying they were refusing to use their technical expertise to “dismantle critical public services. “We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the constitution across presidential administrations,” the 21 staffers wrote in a joint resignation letter, a copy of which was obtained by the Associated Press. “However, it has become clear that we can no longer honor those commitments.”\n\nA federal judge in Seattle blocked the Trump administration’s effort to halt the nation’s refugee admissions system. US district judge Jamal Whitehead said in his ruling after the hearing on Tuesday that the president’s actions amounted to an “effective nullification of congressional will” in setting up the nation’s refugee admissions program. “The president has substantial discretion ... to suspend refugee admissions,” Whitehead told the parties. “But that authority is not limitless.”\n\nA US judge extended an order blocking the Trump administration from instituting a sweeping freeze on trillions of dollars in federal funding by pausing grants, loans and other financial support. US district judge Loren AliKhan in Washington wrote that while some funds had become unfrozen since she first temporarily blocked the administration’s spending pause, there remained a risk the administration might again try to shut off funding. The judge said for those reasons she agreed with groups representing nonprofits and small business that a preliminary injunction was necessary blocking a further funding freeze.\n\nA federal judge in Washington has ordered the Trump administration to pay foreign aid funds to contractors and grant recipients by 11.59pm on Wednesday night, saying there was no sign that it had taken any steps to comply with his earlier order that the funds be unfrozen.\n\nThe Senate confirmed Daniel Driscoll, an Iraq war veteran and adviser to JD Vance, as secretary of the army.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 03.51 CET\n\nThe tax cut proposals in this GOP budget blueprint passed on Tuesday center on $4.5tn in tax breaks, which would extend the tax cuts Trump implemented during his first term.\n\nThese tax cuts are currently set to expire later this year and the proposed package aims to prolong them. But the details of how these tax breaks would be structured haven’t been specified yet.\n\nTrump’s tax cuts helped billionaires massively during his first term, with the richest families in the US paying a lower tax rate than the working class for the first time in history in 2018.\n\nSeveral lawmakers are concerned that the proposed cuts – especially the $880bn over the next decade assigned to the committee overseeing healthcare spending, including Medicaid, and the $230bn allocated to the agriculture committee responsible for food stamps – could hinder their constituents back home.\n\n“The House Republican budget will make people sicker and poorer,” said Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committee. “It will force even more families to live paycheck to paycheck while giving the wealthiest Americans a windfall big enough to buy a new private jet.”\n\nNext steps involve weeks of committee hearings to draft the full legislative text, as well as negotiations with the Senate, where Republicans have their own scaled-back version.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 03.25 CET\n\nUndocumented immigrants in the US who fail to register with the federal government could face fines, imprisonment, or both, according to a directive issued Tuesday by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n“The Trump administration will enforce all our immigration laws – we will not pick and choose which laws we will enforce,” a DHS spokesperson said. “We must know who is in our country for the safety and security of our homeland and all Americans.”\n\nAccording to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services website, all immigrants over the age of 14 who were not fingerprinted or registered when applying for a US visa and who remain in the country for 30 days or longer must register and be fingerprinted.\n\nOnce registered and fingerprinted, DHS will provide evidence of registration, which immigrants over the age of 18 are required to carry at all times.\n\nLast month, upon returning to office, Donald Trump declared illegal immigration at the US-Mexico border a national emergency and directed DHS to ensure that immigrants register with the federal government.\n\nThe administration is also working to end the Biden-era CBP One entry program, which allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants to legally enter the US by scheduling appointments through an app.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 03.08 CET\n\nTrump-forward budget proposal imperiling Medicaid narrowly passes in Republican-led House\n\nThe House narrowly passed the budget resolution by a 217-215 vote after an intense push by Mike Johnson, the speaker, and Donald Trump.\n\nThe budget plan includes an estimated $800bn in potential cuts from Medicaid, a federal program providing healthcare coverage to more than 72 million Americans. The resolution also includes a $4.5tn in tax cuts and increased funding for defense and border security, offset by $2tn in spending reductions over the next decade.\n\nThe budget measure needed to pass by the 14 March deadline or risk a government shutdown.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 02.57 CET\n\nThe Social Security Administration said on Tuesday that it dissolved its office of civil rights and equal opportunity, and its employees will be put on administrative leave as of today.\n\nLee Dudek, Social Security’s acting commissioner, said in a statement that terminating the civil rights office “advances the President’s goal to make all of government more efficient in serving the American public”.\n\nThe agency’s office of civil rights and equal opportunity is responsible for planning and implementing programs designed to ensure equal opportunity in employment for all employees regardless of race, color, national origin, etc., according to its webpage.\n\nSSA says it will transfer responsibility for processing civil rights complaints and reasonable accommodation requests to other agency offices “to ensure compliance with existing legal authorities”.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 02.56 CET\n\nNearly 6,000 veterans have been fired across the federal government since the start of Trump’s term, according to a new analysis by House Democrats.\n\nLauren Gambino\n\nThe report, compiled from data provided by the office of personnel management, estimates that roughly 38,000 federal workers have been fired since Trump took office last month and empowered Elon Musk’s ‘efficiency’ agency to dramatically reduce the federal workforce.\n\n“Our veterans make significant sacrifices in service of our country, but those sacrifices do not seem to matter to President Trump and unchecked billionaire Elon Musk,” Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, ranking member of the House appropriations committee, said in a statement. “They are an essential part of our federal workforce, bringing their expertise to every single agency. Republicans are turning their back on them, allowing Musk to fire at least 6,000 veterans and leave them with no way to feed their families or keep a roof over their heads.”\n\nRepublicans have countered that the cuts are a necessary part of a long-overdue effort to root out government waste and inefficiency.\n\nThe federal government is the largest US employer of veterans, who comprise about 30% of the workforce.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 02.55 CET\n\nTrump says Zelenskyy set to visit White House on Friday to sign minerals deal\n\nAndrew Roth\n\nDonald Trump has said that Volodymyr Zelenskyy is likely to visit the White House on Friday to sign a rare earth minerals deal to pay for US military aid to defend against Russia’s full-scale invasion.\n\nThe announcement followed days of tense negotiations between the US and Ukraine in which Zelenskyy alleged the US was pressuring him to sign a deal worth more than $500bn that would force “ten generations” of Ukrainians to pay it back.\n\nMedia outlets reported late on Tuesday that the terms of an agreement had been reached.\n\n“I hear that he’s coming on Friday,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “Certainly it’s OK with me if he’d like to.”\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, which first reported the deal, the new terms of the deal did not reportedly include the onerous demands for a right to $500bn in potential revenue from exploiting the resources, which include rare earth metals and Ukrainian oil and gas resources.\n\nA framework for the deal included joint ownership of a fund to develop Ukraine’s mineral resources with certain caveats for those resources already contributing to the state budget.\n\nMore on the story here:\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 03.10 CET\n\nMichael Sainato\n\nThe Guardian’s labor reporter, Michael Sainato, spoke to USAid workers who are expected to be ‘escorted’ back to the office to collect their belongings amid Trump’s bid to shut down the foreign aid agency.\n\nStaff who spoke to the Guardian sounded the alarm over the impact of these moves on global security, warning that closing USAid and withdrawing foreign aid is “only leaving war on the table”.\n\nThe agency is “the canary in the coal mine” as Trump seeks to test the limits of his executive powers, said one USAid official, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation and harassment. “We see us as the most acute and boldest example of overreach, that checks and balances ought to restrain the powers of the president and the president should abide by the powers of Congress and the courts.\n\n“Can the president act like a king? We’re a glaring flare for all of those things.”\n\nThe agency has been subjected to attacks and conspiracy theories about its work, with Elon Musk and his supporters making false claims about funding, including a baseless claim about the agency sending $50m to Gaza for condoms, and false claims about grants such as the suggestion by the so-called “department of government efficiency” that $21m had been sent to India to influence elections.\n\nMusk has called the agency “a criminal organization” and argued that it was “time for it to die”. Pushed on his false condoms claim earlier this month, he responded: “Some of the things I say will be incorrect.”\n\nHealth clinics reliant on USAid grants in Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, Iraq and other countries around the world have been forced to shut down and international aid groups have already cut thousands of jobs due to the funding freeze.\n\nThe Trump administration is fighting challenges in court to freeze all USAid funding, place nearly all employees on leave.\n\n“USAid was established by act of Congress. It needs to be un-established by act of Congress. They are ignoring that rule,” the USAid official said. “I would guess around 500 workers, no one has provided specifics, senior leaders, HR and IT people, are left behind to participate in the dismantling of the agency.”\n\nContracts and grants are still being cut and terminated, with only a small fraction of the agency’s work abroad still continuing, they said. “We’re a lifesaving agency. They certainly have done damage that will take years to undo, but even though they’ve closed the building and banned us from it, we’re not done. We still exist,” they said.\n\nRead the full story here:\n\nShare\n\nAmericans are getting more concerned about a potential economic downturn caused by the policies of Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nUS consumer confidence plummeted in February, the biggest monthly decline in nearly four years, the Conference Board, a business research group, said on Tuesday. Inflation and a significant increase in mentions of trade and tariffs were the top concerns for respondents to the board’s survey.\n\nThe group’s consumer confidence index plummeted this month to 98.3 from 105.3 in January. That’s far below the expectations of economists, who projected a reading of 103, according to a survey by FactSet.\n\nThe proportion of consumers expecting a recession over the next year jumped to a nine-month high, the board said.\n\nConsumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of US economic activity and is closely watched by economists for signs about how the American consumer is feeling.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 01.52 CET\n\nMarina Dunbar\n\nTrump’s Iron Dome for America system is now reportedly called Golden Dome\n\nDonald Trump’s Iron Dome for America initiative for a missile defense system protecting US skies from attack has been reportedly renamed the Golden Dome for America.\n\nIn a video published on Thursday, secretary of defense Pete Hegseth referred to the project as “the Golden Dome or Iron Dome”. A defense official confirmed shortly after that the name of the initiative has been officially changed to “Golden Dome”, according to military news website Defense One.\n\nA spokesperson for Space Force did not respond to a Guardian query on the possible name change.\n\nThe idea of a new name comes as a team of technical experts has been assembled by the US Space Force to determine which programs can help build out the initiative.\n\nThe Iron – or perhaps now Golden – Dome for America executive order, signed by Trump on 27 January, is a directive for Hegseth to submit a comprehensive plan that details an implementation strategy, including the required architecture, for a missile defense system.\n\nTrump is known for his grand renaming of things, including the Gulf of Mexico, which is now known officially in the US as the Gulf of America, as well as having a gaudy taste for golden and luxurious decorations, such as that which often adorn his apartments and buildings like Trump Tower in New York.\n\nThe defense system focuses heavily on the concept of space-based sensors and interceptors. The company that currently dominates the market for such equipment is the Elon Musk-owned SpaceX, leading to concerns that this project is another way for Musk to make money from federal programs.\n\nRead the full story here:\n\nShare\n\nJohn Thune, the Senate majority leader, is defending the Trump administration’s cuts to federal workers and programs, calling them a long overdue “scrub” of the federal government.\n\nStill, the Republican from South Dakota acknowledged that the reductions are affecting the home states of GOP senators.\n\n“I think we all understand that this government, the federal government, is long in need of the kind of scrub that is being done to figure out how we can do things better,” Thune said at the Capitol.\n\nHe said that senators would make the Trump administration aware if programs, such as those that impact health and safety, are at risk.\n\nShare\n\nThe Trump administration plans to cut employees at the US Department of Housing and Urban Development who assist officials and citizens in navigating government housing programs, the AP reports.\n\nThese cuts are among the first steps in the administration’s broader plan to reduce HUD’s workforce by half.\n\nThe field policy and management division is expected to lose at least 145 employees – about 40% of its staff – by 18 May.\n\nA memo from the HUD secretary Scott Turner, dated Monday, states that all positions within the office at a certain pay grade and below “are being abolished”.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 00.04 CET\n\nTrump reinstates rule on healthcare cost transparency\n\nTrump reinstated a rule requiring cost transparency in healthcare.\n\nThe rule requires hospitals to publish online the prices for some of their most common services, including MRI scans and caesarean section deliveries. The lack of transparency has often left patients shocked by medical bills.\n\nTrump previously issued a similar order during the final year of his first term.\n\nHospitals and insurers had strongly opposed the rule, with many failing to comply.\n\n“It’s been unpopular in some circles because people make less money,” Trump said. “But it’s great for the patient. It’s great for the people in our country.”\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 01.57 CET\n\nFox News senior White House correspondent, Jacqui Heinrich, condemned the Trump administration’s decision to determine which outlets have access to the president as part of the press pool, a selection that the White House Correspondents’ Association makes.\n\n“This move does not give the power back to the people – it gives power to the White House,” Heinrich posted on X. “The WHCA is democratically elected by the full-time White House press corps.”\n\n“WHCA has determined pools for decades because only representatives FROM our outlets can determine resources all those outlets have – such as staffing – in order to get the President’s message out to the largest possible audience, no matter the day or hour,” she added.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 23.35 CET\n\nUSAid staffers have only 15 minutes to retrieve belongings from their former offices, according to The Associated Press.\n\nFor nearly three weeks, many staffers at the agency’s main building in Washington have been barred from entering as the administration continues dismantling the facility.\n\nSeveral employees have requested permission to retrieve personal items, including family photos and work shoes stored in drawers.\n\nThe notice about the arrangements says that aid workers must undergo security screening before reentering.\n\nThe Guardian’s labor reporter Michael Sainato reports that, in the notice, staffers were told to “bring their own boxes, bags, tape, and/or other containers to remove their personal items; these items will not be provided”.\n\n“Neither USAID, nor any of our assisting agencies, will provide boxes, tape, protective wrapping, or other packaging materials to assist with the retrieval process,” the notice reads.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 23.34 CET\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order suspending security clearances for lawyers at the Covington & Burling law firm that worked with special counsel Jack Smith.\n\nSmith led the federal cases against Trump on charges of trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat and mishandling of classified documents.\n\nThe order comes less than a month after the US justice department fired more than a dozen prosecutors who worked on the criminal cases against Trump in a move to purge people who worked for Smith.\n\nShare\n\nEdward Wong of the New York Times reports that Trump appointees at USAid have sent recently-fired employees a list of more than 100 weapons they are prohibited from bringing when returning to the office to collect their belongings.\n\nFirearms, axes, martial arts weapons, including nunchucks and throwing stars, were in the list, as well as spearguns and dynamite.\n\nStaff will collect their personal belongings at the Ronald Reagan Building this Thursday and Friday\n\nThere have been no known recent incidents of aid agency employees making weapon-related threats, Wong reports.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.49 CET",

        "full_text": "The fate of $20 billion in federal climate funding that was legally committed months before the election has been thrown into question after a weeklong controversy involving “gold bars,” the right-wing group Project Veritas and two federal agencies.\n\nNow, more than 200 planned investments intended to help finance clean energy and environmental projects in underserved communities may be at risk.\n\nLast week, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a press release announcing it had found billions of dollars, or what it called “gold bars,” that had been “parked” at a financial institution during the Biden administration.\n\nIn a video accompanying the release, Lee Zeldin, the leader of the E.P.A., criticized the Biden administration’s decision to use a private bank to disburse the funds and called for Citibank, the bank in question, to return the money.\n\nThe money was “green bank” funding from the E.P.A.’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which received $27 billion under the Biden-era 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nFunds were held in Citibank accounts under the names of eight nonprofit grantees, which were planning to send it to other green banks and loan it out for climate projects.\n\nDept. of Justice resignation\n\nThe situation escalated on Tuesday, when Denise Cheung, a top federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C., abruptly resigned after she refused to open a criminal investigation into an unnamed government vendor and freeze unspent assets. The vendor is believed to be Citibank, and the assets in question are thought to be the $20 billion identified by Zeldin’s team.\n\nCheung said in a resignation letter that she felt there was not sufficient evidence to restrict the nonprofits’ access to the accounts.\n\nBy Thursday, it wasn’t clear whether Citibank would freeze the funds. That has created confusion among grant recipients about whether they’ll have access to the money.\n\nThe Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the E.P.A. referred to a post on Zeldin’s X account. Citibank declined to comment.\n\nWhat about those ‘gold bars’?\n\n“My awesome team at E.P.A. has found the gold bars,” Zeldin said in the video last week. “This scheme was the first of its kind in E.P.A. history, and it was purposely designed to obligate all of the money in a rush job with reduced oversight.”\n\nThe “gold bars” were a reference to a hidden-camera video released by Project Veritas in December. The video appeared to show a person who was then an E.P.A. adviser comparing the outgoing administration’s efforts to spend federal climate money before it left office to throwing “gold bars” off the Titanic.\n\nThough Zeldin characterized the process as a “rush job,” plans to award $20 billion to the eight nonprofits were announced in April. The money was legally committed ahead of a September deadline.\n\nThe role of private banks\n\nThus far, there has been no evidence of illegal activity related to the $20 billion in funds. And the federal government has long made agreements with private banks, including Citibank, to handle financial transactions like the payment of government benefits with debit cards. A 2016 Government Accountability Office report found that one Treasury Department bureau was using 20 financial agents at the time.\n\nAdam Kent, director of blended and inclusive finance at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said a financial agent had been chosen for the E.P.A. grants to make it easier for green banks to raise additional money from private markets. (Green banks typically use a mix of public and private money to fund decarbonization efforts.)\n\nLast year the Biden administration estimated the funds would attract $7 in private capital for every government dollar spent.\n\nGrants and subgrants\n\nIn an interview with Fox News last week, Zeldin described the eight nonprofit grantees with Citibank accounts as “pass-throughs, giving money to subgrantees.”\n\nThis is by design, said Katherine Mogg, who was formerly in charge of legal and regulatory affairs at NY Green Bank. (As of 2021, there were 21 green banks across the country.)\n\nMogg said that long before the Inflation Reduction Act was passed, green energy proponents debated how federal funding could best be spread out to projects all around the country.\n\nThese top-level nonprofits would send funding to smaller entities, like state green banks, and the sub-grantees would then lend money to individual projects, Mogg said. As loan recipients repaid their debt, green banks could use the money to fund more new projects.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nAny attempt to freeze or claw back the green bank grants is likely to result in legal challenges.\n\nEven a relatively short delay could affect long-term plans for businesses counting on the program. In the coming months, more than $1 billion in investments is scheduled to close, including funds for affordable home construction projects and solar farms in Native American and rural communities.\n\nNew data from a NASA plane shows the widening threat of these slow-moving landslides, which have destabilized homes, businesses, and infrastructure like roads and utilities. Researchers have documented how the landslides have pushed westward, almost doubling in area since the state mapped them in 2007.\n\nThe landslides have also sped up in recent years. A month of aerial radar images taken by NASA in the fall revealed how land in the Palos Verdes Peninsula slid toward the ocean by as much as four inches each week between mid-September and mid-October. — Austyn Gaffney and Harry Stevens\n\nRead the full article.\n\nTrump plans deep cuts at office that funds recovery from big disasters\n\nThe Trump administration plans to all but eliminate the office that oversees America’s recovery from the largest disasters, raising questions about how the United States will rebuild from hurricanes, wildfires and other calamities made worse by climate change.\n\nThe Office of Community Planning and Development, part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, pays to rebuild homes and other recovery efforts after the country’s worst disasters, such as Hurricane Helene in North Carolina and Hurricane Milton in Florida. — Christopher Flavelle",

        "full_text": "A federal judge on Monday denied a request by the Associated Press to restore full access for the news agency's journalists after President Donald Trump's administration barred them for continuing to refer to the Gulf of Mexico in coverage.\n\nU.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee, declined to immediately grant the AP's request for a temporary injunction restoring its access to the Oval Office and Air Force One during a hearing in Washington federal court.\n\nThe AP sued three senior Trump aides on Friday, arguing that the decision to block its reporters from those locations violates the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protections against government abridgment of speech by trying to dictate the language they use in reporting the news.\n\nLawyers for the Trump administration argued in a court filing before the hearing that the AP does not have a constitutional right to what it called \"special media access to the president.\"\n\nWhite House Communications Director Steven Cheung in a earlier statement had called the AP lawsuit a \"blatant PR stunt.\" During an appearance last week at the Conservative Political Action Conference, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also said, \"We feel we are in the right in this position.\"\n\nLeavitt is one of the three White House officials named as defendants in the lawsuit. The other two, Chief of Staff Susan Wiles and Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich, have not responded to requests for comment.\n\nTrump signed an executive order last month directing the U.S. Interior Department to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.\n\nThe AP said in January it would continue to use the gulf's long-established name in stories while also acknowledging Trump's efforts to change it.\n\nThe White House banned AP reporters in response. The ban prevents the AP's journalists from seeing and hearing Trump and other top White House officials as they take newsworthy actions or respond in real time to news events.\n\nThe White House Correspondents' Association said in a legal brief backing the AP in the case that the ban \"will chill and distort news coverage of the president to the public's detriment.\" Reuters released a statement in support of the AP.",

I’ll lead Ohio to be the top state in the country where our kids get a world class education in math, reading, writing, critical thinking, and physical education.”\n\nRamaswamy continued to add that under his leadership Ohio would be the top state in the U.S. where “capitalism and meritocracy” is embraced, “instead of apologizing for it.”\n\n“We will lead Ohio to be the top state in the country that takes a hatchet to red tape, over regulation, and bureaucracy,” Ramaswamy added. “We will lead Ohio to be the top state in the country where we lead the way in the sectors of the future, from semiconductors to aerospace.

        "full_text": "ESPN host Stephen A. Smith challenged Whoopi Goldberg during “The View” on Tuesday over the Democratic Party’s messaging problem after the liberal host attempted to defend the messaging by comparing it to President Donald Trump.\n\n“If you think about him being impeached twice, 34 felony convictions, and they still elected him president, it’s not about him winning. It was an indictment against the Democratic Party and what the Democratic Party was offering to American citizens. We might sit up there and talk about, ‘Hey, you should be a party for the working class,’ which the Democrats was once known for. They’re not known for that right now. Why? Because their message was catering towards others and other issues, and they forgot about the people that brought them there, that elevated the Democratic Party to what it was over the last few decades. That’s why they lost. He didn’t win. The Democrats lost,” he told the co-hosts of “The View.”\n\nSmith, a Trump critic, has regularly criticized the Democratic Party and their messaging ahead of the election as well as after Trump won.\n\nCo-host Whoopi Goldberg attempted to push back on Smith and said she wanted to remind people of what those issues were, arguing they included, “Making sure that families had what they need. SNAP, making sure stuff is there. Making sure that the America that we all grew up in where you could come and be whoever you were supposed to be or want to be, you still have that right. All these things are the things that the Democrats have always said.”\n\nShe then compared that to President Donald Trump’s early executive actions, specifically in cutting federal jobs, as Smith pushed back.\n\n“Before you brought that up, you brought up the message that the Democratic Party was disseminating. I’m challenging you on that. That is not what they were doing,” he said.\n\nGoldberg shot back, “Oh, yes, it was. I was here. We did it.”\n\nSmith went on to argue that Biden contributed to a major migrant crisis and wondered why, pointing out that former President Barack Obama deported more migrants than Trump.\n\n“The bottom line, you’re Joe Biden, you open borders. Now, remember, Barack Obama deported more people than Trump did. You know what he didn’t do, he didn’t stick out his chest and bloviate about it, he just did it. What does Joe Biden do? Who is the Democrat, who is the vice president under Barack Obama? He opens borders. Over 12-plus million people entered the country. You had stuff going on in the streets, there was a migrant crisis,” Smith said.\n\nIn the second segment, Smith made the argument that Trump did have a mandate from the American people, pointing to his gains within minority groups.\n\n“If you’re the Democratic Party and you lost 49.8% to 48.3%, and looking at that 1.5% difference, that’s an excuse to say, what we did really wasn’t that bad, we should continue to do that. No, don’t continue to do it, find a new strategy,” he said.\n\nSmith demanded to know what Democrats were doing to win future elections, and said he would continue to interview prominent Democratic figures and ask them that question.\n\n“I want somebody to step up and recognize that man in the Oval Office, whether you like it or not, is potent, he’s coming, and he wins, you got to find a way to beat him,” he said.",

        "full_text": "1 hour ago\n\nJude Sheerin\n\nBBC News, Washington\n\nPresident Donald Trump declared \"the American Dream is unstoppable\" as he addressed a raucous joint session of the US Congress for the first time since he returned to power.\n\nIn the longest presidential speech to lawmakers on record, he outlined his vision for his second term, as Republicans applauded a high-octane six weeks that has reshaped domestic and foreign policy.\n\nTrump was heckled by Democrats and he goaded them in turn during the rowdy primetime address.\n\nThe Republican president has moved to slash the federal workforce and crack down on immigration, while imposing tariffs on America's biggest trading partners and shaking up the transatlantic alliance over the war in Ukraine.\n\nHere are six of the key takeaways.\n\nTrump predicts a bumpy ride ahead on tariffs\n\nFollowing a second day of market turbulence, Trump played down the potential economic fallout from a trade war he ignited this week, including 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% on Chinese imports.\n\nBut in contrast with the ovations that greeted his other policy objectives, many Republicans remained seated, a sign of how Trump's import taxes have divided his party.\n\n\"Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again,\" he said.\n\n\"And it's happening. And it will happen rather quickly. There'll be a little disturbance, but we're okay with that. It won't be much.\"\n\nTrump added that reciprocal tariffs tailored to US trading partners would \"kick in\" on 2 April.\n\nEarlier in the day, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox Business that Trump could announce a trade deal with Mexico and Canada as soon as Wednesday.\n\nTrump will 'probably' cut tariffs, says commerce chief\n\nWhat are tariffs, and why is Trump using them?\n\nA minerals deal with Ukraine looks back on\n\nTrump said he had received an \"important letter\" from Ukraine's leader earlier in the day, which appeared to match what Volodymyr Zelensky posted publicly on social media.\n\nUkraine's president had said he was now ready to work under Trump's \"strong leadership\" to end the war and \"come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer\".\n\n\"I appreciate that he sent this letter,\" Trump told lawmakers.\n\nZelensky offered the olive branch a day after Trump paused all military aid to the beleaguered US ally.\n\nIt followed an acrimonious Oval Office meeting last week when the two leaders argued in front of TV cameras, before cancelling plans to sign a minerals deal that would allow the US to profit from an economic partnership involving Ukraine's resources.\n\nTrump was reportedly hoping to announce during his speech to Congress that the deal had finally been sealed. But it did not materialise.\n\nLive updates: Trump 'appreciates' Zelensky's message\n\nTrump and Zelensky's fraying relationship, in their own words\n\nGreenland is in his sights, Lesotho isn't\n\nDespite most of his 99-minute speech focusing on domestic issues, Trump's worldview also came more sharply into focus.\n\nThere are places in the world he wants to expand US influence and others where he wants to withdraw.\n\nRepeating his desire for the US to acquire Greenland, he vowed \"we're going to get it - one way or the other\". And he said his administration would \"reclaim\" the Panama Canal.\n\nThere were several mentions of African countries when he rattled through a list of what he described as wasteful spending under his predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\nLiberia, Mali, Mozambique and Uganda were all places unfairly benefiting from US aid, he said.\n\nBut his most pointed remark was about Lesotho, which he said was a country \"nobody has ever heard of\" despite receiving $8m (£6.2m) to promote LGBT rights.\n\nWhy does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?\n\nHe stood by Musk despite protests over cuts\n\nEarly on Trump name-checked his billionaire adviser Elon Musk, who was watching from the gallery.\n\nThe tech mogul's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) taskforce has moved to fire tens of thousands of federal workers, cut billions of dollars in foreign aid and slash programmes across the US government.\n\nThe SpaceX and Tesla boss, wearing a dark suit with a blue tie, stood and acknowledged the cheers from the crowd.\n\n\"Thank you, Elon,\" the 78-year-old president said. \"He's working very hard. He didn't need this.\"\n\nMusk's cuts have sparked some angry scenes at town hall meetings and his instructions to federal employees have at times been overruled by members of Trump's cabinet.\n\nIn the chamber, Democratic lawmakers held up signs saying \"Musk steals\" and \"false\".\n\nDoge claims to have saved $105bn already but that figure can't be independently verified. Receipts have been published for $18.6bn worth of savings but accounting errors have been reported by US media outlets that have analysed the figures.\n\nYoung Republicans cheer Trump on from Texas watch party\n\nDemocratic pushback was loud and it was pink\n\nWithin the first five minutes of the address, Al Green of Texas was escorted out of the chamber by the sergeant-at-arms after refusing to comply with the House Speaker's demands that he stop heckling the president and take his seat.\n\nAs Trump spoke, other Democrats held up signs saying \"This is a lie\".\n\nWith Republicans in control of the White House, House of Representatives and Senate, Democrats have been largely leaderless as they work to hone their message and counter the blitz of activity from the Trump administration.\n\nMany Democratic women arrived in the House chamber wearing pink pantsuits in protest. Dozens from their party – some of them wearing the words \"Resist\" printed on the backs of their shirts - exited the chamber during the speech.\n\n\"There is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy,\" Trump said, appearing to revel in the partisan rancour.\n\nDemocratic leadership chose Elissa Slotkin of Michigan - a first-term senator elected in a battleground state that Trump won in November - to deliver the party's official response.\n\nShe accused Trump of an \"unprecedented giveaway to his billionaire friends\" and warned \"he could walk us right into a recession\".\n\nHe's betting on energy to bring down inflation\n\nTrump pledged to voters that he would beat inflation on his return to office and he used the speech to say his focus would be to reduce the cost of energy, by opening up the country to new oil and gas drilling.\n\n\"We have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on earth, and by far, and now I fully authorize the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it. It's called drill, baby, drill.\"\n\nThe soaring cost of eggs has been headline news in recent weeks, and Trump made clear who he felt was responsible.\n\n\"Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control - and we are working hard to get it back down,\" he added.\n\nEgg prices rose as the Biden administration directed millions of egg-laying birds to be culled last year amid a bird flu outbreak, though prices have continued rising in Trump's fledgling presidency.\n\nInflation was slightly elevated at 3% last month, but way down from its peak of 9.1% in 2022.\n\nOnly one in three Americans approve of Trump's handling of cost of living, according to a Reuters/Ipsos survey on Tuesday.\n\nFact-checking Trump's address to Congress\n\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "full_text": "Summary Chaos in legislature as opposition protests Demonstrations are major threat to Vucic Major Belgrade protest planned for March 15 BELGRADE, March 4 (Reuters) - Serbian opposition lawmakers threw smoke grenades and used pepper spray inside parliament on Tuesday to protest against the government and to support demonstrating students , with one legislator suffering a stroke during the chaos. Four months of student-led demonstrations , sparked by the deaths of 15 people when a railway station roof collapsed , have drawn in teachers, farmers and others to become the biggest threat yet to President Aleksandar Vucic's decade-long rule, with many denouncing rampant corruption and incompetence in government. At the legislative session, after the ruling coalition led by the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) approved the agenda, some opposition politicians ran from their seats towards the parliamentary speaker and scuffled with security guards. Others tossed smoke grenades and used pepper spray. A live TV broadcast showed black and pink smoke billowing inside the parliament, which has seen brawls before, in the decades since the introduction of multi-party democracy in 1990. Vucic later said authorities would hold all those deputies involved in the fracas to account, calling it \"hooliganism\". Under Serbian law, parliamentary deputies enjoy immunity from prosecution but can lose it if they commit serious crimes. POLITICIAN HURT Speaker Ana Brnabic said three lawmakers were injured and one, Jasmina Obradovic of the SNS party, had suffered a stroke and was hospitalised. Zlatibor Loncar, the Health Minister later said Obradovic was in a serious condition.

SERBIAN PARLIAMENT POOL / VIDEOPLUS/Handout via REUTERS , As the session continued, ruling coalition politicians debated while opposition lawmakers whistled and blew horns. Opposition deputies also held signs reading \"general strike\" and \"justice for those killed\", referring to those who died when the station roof collapsed in the city of Novi Sad last November. Outside parliament hundreds of protesters stood in silence to honour those killed. Protest leaders called for a major rally in the capital Belgrade on March 15. The ruling coalition says Western intelligence agencies are trying to destabilise Serbia and topple the government by backing the protests. \"We have a proposal ... to have a transitional government,\" Radomir Lazovic of the opposition Green-Left Front told supporters in front of the parliament. The opposition says a transitional government should secure conditions for free and fair elections, but Vucic and his allies have so far rejected that demand. \"This was a failed attempt of the ruling coalition to show it is in control ..., and (there's) a potential for an escalation,\" Radivoje Grujic, a Warsaw-based consultant told Reuters, commenting on the parliamentary session. Parliament was due to adopt a law increasing funds for universities - one of the main demands of protesting students. But other items put on the agenda by the ruling coalition including the one about noting the resignation of Prime Minister Milos Vucevic angered the opposition.

        "full_text": "The Trump administration on Tuesday re-designated the Houthi militant group in Yemen as a foreign terrorist organization, reversing a decision made by President Joe Biden in 2021, after more than a year of attacks on U.S. Navy and commercial vessels at sea.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement that he was fulfilling one of President Donald Trump’s campaign promises after hundreds of Houthi attacks on vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The Houthis have described their campaign of violence as an act of solidarity with Hamas, the militant group whose attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, triggered a war in Gaza that has upended security across the region.\n\n“Today’s action taken by the State Department demonstrates the Trump Administration’s commitment to protecting our national security interests, the safety of the American people, and the security of the United States,” Rubio said. “Terrorist designations play a critical role in our fight against terrorism and are an effective way to curtail support for terrorist activities.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRubio also warned China and other countries that may seek to maintain ties with the Houthis, noting that a recent attack “spared Chinese-flagged ships while targeting American and allied vessels.” The United States, Rubio declared, “will not tolerate any country engaging with terrorist organizations like the Houthis in the name of practicing legitimate international business.”\n\nThe group, formally known as Ansar Allah, was already the subject of earlier U.S. sanctions and other punitive measures, but the foreign terrorist designation makes it a crime for people or entities such as banks to offer “material support or resources” to the Houthis and bars its members from the United States.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Justice Department said it is offering up to $15 million for information leading to the disruption of the Houthis’ finances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Houthis, a rebel group that seized the Yemeni capital of Sanaa in 2014, function as the de facto government across a wide swath of Yemen, including in many of its most populous areas. Relying heavily on weapons provided by Iran, the Houthis have aligned themselves with other regional militant groups and positioned themselves as a leader of the armed opposition to Israel and the United States.\n\nShortly before departing office in January 2021, the first Trump administration designated the Houthis a foreign terrorist organization, citing cross-border violence into Saudi Arabia and an attack on an airport in Aden, a southern Yemeni city. The Biden administration undid that designation the following month, citing the limitations it placed on delivering humanitarian aid to Yemen, where a decade of civil conflict has fueled severe poverty and malnutrition.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Hamas attack in October 2023, Houthi leaders said they would attack ships associated with Israel. The campaign that followed was often indiscriminate, however, with vessels from a variety of countries targeted and at least a couple that were sunk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Biden administration responded by recruiting partners and allies to join a multinational naval task force to protect shipping and eventually launching airstrikes at the Houthis. Biden administration officials also sought to curtail weapons smuggling from Iran to Yemen, but officials familiar with the issue said that effort was difficult.\n\nThe U.S. military increased its tempo of strikes on Houthi targets in the final weeks of the Biden administration in response to what former U.S. officials said was an increasingly aggressive campaign to strike both Israeli and U.S. assets in the region.\n\nOn Tuesday, Houthi authorities announced they had shot down an American MQ-9 Reaper drone over Yemeni airspace in Hodeida governate, in what they said was the 15th downing of enemy aircraft since Hamas’s October 2023 attack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA U.S. defense official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said the U.S. military had lost contact with an MQ-9 over the Red Sea on Monday. “We are actively assessing the incident to determine the cause and follow-on actions,” the official said.\n\nFormer officials said the Biden administration developed a proposal that would have re-designated the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization late last year, but officials ultimately decided to leave that decision to the incoming Trump administration.\n\nU.S. officials have said that while Iran has provided significant support to the Houthis, they see the group as an independent actor that might not necessarily respond to Tehran’s instructions to stand down its maritime attacks. The Houthis have also established their own substantial, independent weapons production capability.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMohammed Al-Basha, a Yemen analyst, said the designation may result in additional U.S. steps to isolate the Houthis financially and logistically, such as cutting off the access of Yemeni banks from the global banking system. But he also noted that the group could attempt to evade the measures by working with Russia or other actors to obtain fuel or other imports.\n\nThe Houthis have largely halted their attacks on commercial and naval vessels following Israel’s ceasefire with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Al-Basha said, but Houthi officials have warned they will resume drone and missile strikes should the deal break down.\n\nAid groups have warned about the humanitarian impact of a re-designation. In a January statement following the Trump administration’s announcement that it intended to target the Houthis, Oxfam America said that Trump’s previous designation had damaging impacts on imports and commerce even before it took effect.\n\n“We know that humanitarian exemptions weren’t enough to stop the immediate impacts,” Scott Paul, the group’s peace and security director, said in January. “Even with those caveats, exporters canceled contracts, banks prepared to scale back, and humanitarian organizations began to plan for a dramatic escalation with even fewer resources and more constraints.”",

        "full_text": "Linda McMahon, the new secretary of Education, sent out the agency’s “final mission” message to staffers after her confirmation vote on Monday, previewing President Trump’s plans to roll up the department.\n\nIn her message, McMahon said she is ready to take on one of Trump’s “most momentous campaign promises to families” and “send education back to the states.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly expressed desire to eliminate the federal Education Department, saying before McMahon’s party-line Senate confirmation that he had told her to put herself “out of a job.”\n\nThe message focused on the department’s “new era of accountability” and how the upcoming months of cutting bureaucracy from the agency will lead to big changes.\n\n“This restoration will profoundly impact staff, budgets, and agency operations here at the Department. In coming months, we will partner with Congress and other federal agencies to determine the best path forward to fulfill the expectations of the President and the American people. We will eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy so that our colleges, K-12 schools, students, and teachers can innovate and thrive,” McMahon said.\n\nShe laid out the three convictions staffers will need to have: parents should choose their children’s education; taxpayer-funded schools are for math and reading, “not divisive DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] programs and gender ideology;” and postsecondary education should be for creating well-paying jobs useful to the workforce.\n\n“Removing red tape and bureaucratic barriers will empower parents to make the best educational choices for their children. An effective transfer of educational oversight to the states will mean more autonomy for local communities. Teachers, too, will benefit from less micromanagement in the classroom — enabling them to get back to basics,” McMahon said.\n\nThe new Education secretary also mentioned Trump’s executive orders promoting school choice and ridding schools of critical race theory and DEI programs.\n\nThe message comes after dozens of staffers have already been put on administrative leave and millions of dollars in federal education contracts have been canceled as Trump and Elon Musk move to dramatically reshape and reduce the federal government.\n\nWhile the future is uncertain for Education Department employees, McMahon said, “every staff member of this Department should be enthusiastic about any change that will benefit students.”",

        "full_text": "President Trump will address Congress on Tuesday night to sell his vision for his second administration, as he remakes American government and tests the limits of executive power.\n\nThe speech comes after a blitz of executive actions seeking to purge a federal bureaucracy he views as disloyal and otherwise reshape domestic and foreign policy. In pursuing his agenda, Mr. Trump has repeatedly made false statements and claims lacking evidence, including that Ukraine started the war with Russia and that diversity programs at the Federal Aviation Administration led to a plane crash this year.\n\nThe president’s address is expected to touch on the major cuts that he and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency have ordered for federal programs and the government’s work force. He is also expected to trumpet his immigration crackdown and his moves to impose steep tariffs in an effort to bolster domestic manufacturing.\n\nMr. Trump’s remarks on these issues over the past few weeks offer a preview of possible talking points. Here’s a fact-check:\n\nWhat Was Said\n\n“We were richest — the richest, relatively — from, think of this, from 1870 to 1913. That was our richest because we collected tariffs from foreign countries that came in and took our jobs and took our money, took our everything, but they charged tariffs.”\n\n— at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 22\n\nFalse. Mr. Trump is wrong that the United States was richest during the Gilded Age, and he is overstating the impact of tariffs. He is also wrong that the country grew less prosperous in 1913, when a permanent federal income tax was introduced.\n\nA White House spokeswoman noted that wages and the economy grew rapidly during the Gilded Age, but did not provide evidence of unparalleled prosperity in that era. The United States is far richer now than it was during that time, even when accounting for inflation. From 1870 to 1913, the country’s gross domestic product grew to nearly $1 trillion from about $190 billion, and to $10,000 from $4,800 per capita. Those figures have continued to rise precipitously, reaching nearly $20 trillion and more than $58,000 per capita in 2022.\n\nRelative to other countries, the United States was just as rich or richer in the post-World War II era than in the Gilded Age. The United States was the third-largest economy in 1870, after China and India, but had become the world’s largest by 1920, making up about 23 percent of global G.D.P. It remained the world’s largest economy until 2014, when China took the lead.\n\nInequality, though, reached a peak during the Gilded Age. The United States had one of the highest rates of economic disparity in the world in 1910. Estimates of U.S. inequality, using a standard global metric, fell after the introduction of taxes aimed at wealthier people but rebounded somewhat in recent decades.\n\nThe U.S. economy did grow at a rapid clip in the Gilded Age, but tariffs were not the sole factor, said Richard White, a historian at Stanford University and an expert on the Gilded Age. He noted other reasons, including the U.S. seizure of Native land and the population’s doubling from 1860 to 1890, in large part because of immigration.\n\nWhat Was Said\n\n“We have found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud so far.”\n\n— before a bilateral meeting with President Emmanuel Macron of France on Feb. 24\n\nThis lacks evidence. The White House spokeswoman said the Department of Government Efficiency had identified hundreds of billions of dollars in fraud in the federal government. But even the government overhaul team itself does not purport to have found that much in specific savings or fraud.\n\nAccording to Mr. Musk’s team, it has generated $105 billion in savings, as of Sunday. The initiative’s website includes details for canceled contracts that it says total about $8 billion in savings and broad descriptions for around $10 billion in terminated grants and $660 million in terminated leases. That’s a total of less than $20 billion, with the rest appearing unexplained.\n\nAs The New York Times and other news outlets have documented, the roughly $20 billion in savings is also not verified. The initiative has updated its website periodically to address mistakes such as contracts erroneously listed as worth billions but actually worth millions, contracts that were counted multiple times and contracts that have long ended or were not actually canceled.\n\nThe federal Government Accountability Office estimated last year, before the creation of DOGE, that the government loses $233 billion to $521 billion a year to fraud. But it is unclear if any of the Trump administration cuts announced thus far were canceled payments for fraudulent services.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump and other officials have cast spending with which they disagree as wasteful, fraud involves deception or misrepresentation. For example, DOGE has said that it has canceled leases at underused and vacant properties and that there is “plenty of available office space for the current workforce.” It did not mention fraud in those leases.\n\nWhat Was Said\n\n“Europe has given $100 billion. The United States has given $350 billion because we had a stupid, incompetent president and administration, 350. But here’s worse: Europe gave it in the form of a loan; they get their money back.”\n\n— at CPAC on Feb. 22, in reference to aid to Ukraine\n\nThis is exaggerated. Mr. Trump is overstating the United States’ financial support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s invasion, understating Europe’s, and misrepresenting the proportion of loans and grants that each has given.\n\nOfficial and independent estimates of American aid to Ukraine show it is about half of Mr. Trump’s figure. The Congressional Research Service reported that Congress has appropriated $174 billion in aid for Ukraine since the 2022 fiscal year. The Pentagon’s inspector general estimated that figure was about $182 billion.\n\nThe White House spokeswoman argued that there were tens of billions more in indirect costs, which she said included lost trade with Russia because of economic sanctions as well as the war’s inflationary impact. But lost trade and inflation also affected Europe, which was one of Russia’s biggest trading partners before the war. Mr. Trump, at other times, has conceded that the amount of aid the United States has provided to Ukraine might be less than $350 billion.\n\nThe European Union has estimated that its member states made available about $145 billion in aid, with tens of billions more committed.\n\nMr. Trump has a point that the bulk of American aid has been in grants and direct assistance rather than loans, but he is overstating the proportion of loans the European Union has provided.\n\nThe Pentagon’s inspector general noted that the United States provided about $20 billion, or roughly 10 percent of total aid, in loans. In comparison, the European Union says it has provided about 35 percent of total aid, roughly $50 billion, in loans.\n\nFaced with an expansionist Russia and an unpredictable American president, European leaders are also looking to increase their own military spending and shoulder a heavier burden in Ukraine’s and the continent’s defense.\n\nWhat Was Said\n\n“For four long years, you had a president who put illegal aliens up in penthouse suites and beautiful hotels on Park Avenue or on Madison Avenue or on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.” — at CPAC on Feb. 22\n\n“They sent $59 million to New York City for a hotel, for a little bit of nothing, what they’ve done. A hotel that was not luxury that’s getting luxury rates for migrants, where they’re making a fortune.” — at a swearing-in ceremony on Feb. 12\n\nThis is misleading. New York did house tens of thousands of migrants in hotels, but Mr. Trump is largely wrong about where the migrants were housed, the payments and the Biden administration’s role.\n\nIn 2023, Congress created the Shelter and Services Program, which in the 2024 fiscal year doled out about $640 million in grants to groups and localities that provide shelter and other services to migrants. The program does not directly pay for hotel rooms or decide where exactly migrants are housed.\n\nNew York City received around $190 million total in the 2023 and 2024 fiscal years, according to federal data.\n\nBut the city has spent far more than what it has received from the federal government to house migrants, as it sought to provide lodging beyond already-squeezed city shelters. According to a comptroller report, the city spent nearly $1 billion on housing migrants at 119 hotels from September 2022 to August 2024. Most were budget or midscale properties, receiving an average nightly rate of $156 in the 2024 fiscal year, compared with a cost of around $52 for a shelter bed. About 19 of the hotels were in Manhattan.",

        "full_text": "For much of the past decade, President Donald Trump and his allies have been waging a war against the so-called \"deep state\"—and the conflict has only escalated since Trump's return to power.\n\nThere's no official definition of the term, of course. Loosely, the deep state is the collection of bureaucrats, contractors, intelligence officials, and other official or even quasi-official entities that more-or-less retain their power no matter who occupies the White House or which party controls Congress. But it's more specific than that. Implicit in talk about the deep state is the idea that certain individuals outside the official chain of command wield the true power in the federal government, and that they frequently ignore or thwart the will of the people's elected and appointed representatives. In a nutshell, the deep state is undemocratic and unaccountable, even to powerful figures in the federal government.\n\nTrump has cast the deep state as one of the chief antagonists of his populist movement, in no small part because such movements always require enemies (and the less well-defined the better). Much of what the second Trump administration has done so far—from the mass firings of federal employees to the appointment of unorthodox leaders at the Pentagon, FBI, and other key outposts—is probably best understood as a direct assault upon this perceived opponent.\n\nBut at the same time that he's focused on dismantling the deep state, Trump seems to have built his own undemocratic, unaccountable executive apparatus.\n\nHow else should we view the incident that The Washington Post reported on last week involving Elon Musk, the unofficial head of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), and Secretary of State Marco Rubio?\n\nAs DOGE was slashing its way through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Rubio issued a waiver ensuring that \"existing life-saving humanitarian assistance programs\" should continue, despite the announced shutdown of USAID. \"Several times, USAID managers prepared packages of these payments and got the agency's interim leaders to sign off on them with support from the White House,\" the Post reported. \"But each time, using their new gatekeeping powers and clearly acting on orders from Musk or one of his lieutenants, [Luke] Farritor and [Gavin] Kliger would veto the payments—a process that required them to manually check boxes in the payment system one at a time, the same tedious way you probably pay your bills online.\"\n\nAs a result, USAID clinics that were supposed to be protected by Rubio's order were shuttered.\n\nThat is an almost perfect illustration of how conservatives used to believe the deep state operated—with unelected, unofficial back-channel operatives overruling the plainly stated instructions of those who are nominally in power.\n\nAnd, sure, much of USAID's spending seems to have been wasteful and in need of a thorough audit, if not a serious cut. Yes, you can also make whatever jokes you'd like about Rubio getting exactly what he deserves for becoming Trump's lackey.\n\nStill, this should be worrying to anyone who takes seriously the threat of the deep state or values the rule of law.\n\nWhatever your views of Musk and Rubio as individuals, it simply cannot be that the Senate-confirmed secretary of state is having his decisions overruled by a man (or his lieutenants) who still lacks any official place in the White House's organizational chart and who runs a rebranded version of the U.S. Digital Service, an agency meant to streamline the executive branch's digital outreach efforts that has no statutory authority to make spending decisions.\n\nIt's an encouraging sign that some Republicans are upset about this.\n\n\"Now that Marco is confirmed and in place, there should be nobody in the administration—outside of the president of the United States or at the direction of the president—that should pause, delay, or cancel anything Marco thinks is in our best national interest,\" Sen. Thom Tillis (R–N.C.) told NOTUS last week in response to a question about the Rubio/Musk turf war. Tillis also chalked up the incident to a case of having \"a lot of cooks in the kitchen\" but said there should be no doubt that Rubio, in this case, is \"head chef.\"\n\nMaybe it was all just a mix-up. But while the situation with USAID and Rubio is the most high-profile, it is not the only example of DOGE and Musk operating like the very deep state Republicans used to criticize.\n\nTake, for another example, how the Trump administration is working to exempt DOGE from the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). As Reason's C.J. Ciaramella reported, Justice Department lawyers are now arguing that the DOGE does not have to respond to FOIA requests because it is no longer part of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB).\n\nMuch of the office of the president is exempt from FOIA (the OMB is a bit of an outlier), but that maneuver still \"runs contrary to Trump and Elon Musk's promises and stated goals of delivering open, transparent government to the public,\" Ciaramella wrote. Indeed, Musk has claimed that \"all aspects of the government must be fully transparent and accountable to the people,\" Musk posted on X earlier this month. \"No exceptions.\"\n\nWell, some exceptions, apparently.\n\nMusk's role within the executive branch is starting to look every bit as vague and unaccountable as the shadowy deep state operatives that Trump campaigned against—and that lack of clarity might soon undermine some of what DOGE has accomplished. In a statement to a U.S. district judge in February, a White House attorney explained that Musk is a \"special government employee\" and an adviser to the president, not the actual head of the DOGE or even an employee of the department.\n\nSo who is running things? The White House said last week that Amy Gleason is now the administrator of the DOGE project. But Musk remains the face of the effort, and federal judges assessing the legality of DOGE's actions seem to have questions about the chain of command.\n\n\"Based on the limited record I have before me, I have some concerns about the constitutionality of U.S.D.S.'s structure and operations,\" Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said during a hearing in the federal district court last week. The New York Times notes that she \"expressed particular concern that [Musk's role] violated the appointments clause of the Constitution, which requires leaders of federal agencies to be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.\"\n\nYou have to assume that other federal judges hearing other legal and constitutional challenges to DOGE's spending cuts will soon be asking similar questions. Even if the Trump administration can fall back on the claim that those changes are authorized by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), judges are likely to look less favorably on these maneuvers if they appear to be happening on the orders of someone who holds no actual power (and, don't forget, runs a business empire that's significantly funded by government contracts).\n\nOverruling the decisions made by legally appointed officials. Dodging transparency. Refusing to identify who is running the show. Are Musk and the DOGE just the deep state by a different name?\n\nSome clarity and transparency from the White House about Musk's official status and the limits of DOGE's powers would go a long way toward establishing the necessary constitutional credibility to make any of these cuts stick—and would have practical benefits too, like clearing up whether federal workers are supposed to respond to his emailed demands.\n\nIt is fair to point out, as Reason's Christian Britschgi has, that Musk is not the first personal adviser to the president who has occupied an unclear and constitutionally dubious role while exercising vast, unofficial powers from the White House.\n\nBut Trump promised to demolish the deep state, not reshuffle the seating chart. Instead, he seems to be delivering a new version of the deep state, but one oriented toward conservative ends—which is, in fairness, what some conservatives wanted.\n\nThat might be good enough for some Republicans who can't see past the next election. Principled conservatives and libertarians, however, should balk at the constitutionally dubious nature of all this and recognize that a smaller government with a more powerful set of unaccountable executive officials is unlikely to be much of a win for liberty.",

        "full_text": "Update(1425ET): Is President Trump going to announce 'mission accomplished' on the Ukraine minerals deal during tonight's speech before a joint session of Congress? A breaking Reuters headline strongly suggests this is the case:\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump's administration and Ukraine plan to sign the much-debated minerals deal following a disastrous Oval Office meeting Friday in which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was dismissed from the building, four people familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has told his advisers that he wants to announce the agreement in his address to Congress Tuesday evening, three of the sources said, cautioning that the deal had yet to be signed and the situation could change.\n\nBut as we've seen in the last several days since Friday, a lot can happen in one afternoon. Zelensky gave an 'almost apology' on Tuesday (below), but not quite what the administration seems to be asking for.\n\nAs of yet, \"It was unclear if the deal has changed,\" Reuters notes. \"The deal that was to be signed last week included no explicit security guarantees for Ukraine but gave the U.S. access to revenues from Ukraine's natural resources. It also envisaged the Ukrainian government contributing 50% of future monetization of any state-owned natural resources to a U.S.-Ukraine managed reconstruction investment fund.\"\n\nA key caveat... we've seen these trial positive news balloons prematurely floated before:\n\nThis is all happening less than 24 hours after the Trump White House ordered an end to military aid to Ukraine, or at least a \"pause\". Zelensky has meanwhile declared he's ready to move forward under Trump's \"strong leadership\" - but we're unlikely to ultimately know for sure until Trump's address tonight. And then there's the question of if there will be a final signing ceremony, or if both sides have finally agreed to all the details, such as Zelensky's demanded strong security guarantees.\n\n* * *\n\nTrump wants an explicit public apology from Zelensky - that's according to Fox White House correspondent Peter Doocy, who described the following on Monday...\n\n\"Nothing is gonna happen with this minerals deal until Zelensky goes in front of cameras and makes an explicit public apology for the way he behaved in the Oval Office with that meeting,\" Doocy said in a live broadcast from the White House lawn. President Zelensky on Tuesday is reiterating he's \"ready\" to sign the minerals deal with the US.\n\nThis is because in the wake of the disastrous Zelensky visit, \"there's now quite a disconnect happening here at the White House with their allies in Kiev.\"\n\nAs for the requirement of a recorded apology by Zelensky to make amends, Doocy said he was specifically \"told by a senior official\" in the Trump administration.\n\nPresident Zelensky himself had this weekend said he still hopes for \"constructive dialogue\" with Washington and has expressed willingness to still sign the agreement.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio had just hours after Zelensky left the White House Friday advised the Ukrainian leader to apologize \"for wasting our time\" and for \"turning this thing into the fiasco for him that it became.\" Zelensky has still not done so. There are these 'regret' statements issues from his office Tuesday:\n\nthe way the White House meeting turned out was regrettable\n\nKyiv ready to work under 'Trump's strong leadership' for peace: Zelensky\n\nZelensky says wants to 'make things right' with Trump\n\n“My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump’s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts,” Zelenskiy said Tuesday on X. “The first stages could be the release of prisoners and truce in the sky — ban on missiles, long-ranged drones, bombs on energy and other civilian infrastructure — and truce in the sea immediately, if Russia will do the same.” Below is Zelensky's full, latest public statement:\n\nGOP Congressional leaders are meanwhile still holding out hope that a deal will be reached. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), a co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Ukraine Caucus, said he's confident a minerals deal will still \"be signed in short order.\"\n\nWatch Fox's Doocy explain what's required of Zelensky below, based on US admin officials...\n\n\"We are 100% getting this train back on the tracks,\" Fitzpatrick wrote on X on Monday. \"This mineral deal will be signed in short order, which will lead to a strong long-term economic partnership between the United States and Ukraine, and which will ultimately and naturally lead to security assistance.\"\n\nBut it sounds like from the White House's perspective a lot will be determined by Zelensky's actions in the coming days. Here's what US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told CNN on Sunday: \"it’s unclear whether President Zelensky, particularly after what we saw on Friday, is ready to transition Ukraine to an end to this war, and to negotiate and have to compromise.\" Waltz then said that \"we need a leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians, and end this war\" - in remarks that hinted at regime change in Kiev.\n\n* * *\n\nIs a full-on apology coming?...\n\n* * *",

He pointed to $1.3 billion Canada is spending on new security measures along the border.\n\nBoth countries called the link between fentanyl smuggling and trade barriers unjustified and announced plans to retaliate.\n\nPresident Trump is expected to speak about the clash Tuesday night in an address before Congress. In a statement Monday, the White House once again pointed to drugs as a key motivation for new U.S. trade barriers, describing the situation as a \"national emergency.\"\n\n\"While President Trump gave both Canada and Mexico ample opportunity to curb the dangerous cartel activity and influx of lethal drugs flowing into our country, they have failed to adequately address the situation,\" the U.S. statement said.\n\nThe U.S. on Tuesday imposed 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China.\n\nTrump has continued to describe fentanyl overdoses as an escalating crisis in the U.S., despite the fact that fatal overdoses have plummeted since 2023 — down nearly 24%, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nTrudeau says Canada will retaliate with tariffs on $155 billion of U.S. goods, phased in over the next three weeks.\n\nChinese officials said they too have already stepped up cooperation with the U.S. on drug interdiction efforts. Speaking Monday, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian accused the Trump administration of using \"the fentanyl issue as a pretext\" to threaten China.\n\n\"The U.S.'s attempts to politicize and weaponize trade and economic issues, levy tariff hikes on Chinese imports under the pretext of fentanyl, and create blocks to its normal trade, investment and economic cooperation with China will only harm its own economic interests and international credibility,\" Jian said.\n\nMany of the industrial chemicals used to make fentanyl — and other synthetic street drugs — have been linked to firms operating in mainland China. In the past, however, Chinese officials have described the fentanyl crisis as a domestic concern inside the U.S. that should be solved by curbing demand and street drug use.\n\nBeijing responded to the Trump administration's latest tariff hike by slapping additional tariffs of 10-15% on a variety of U.S. agricultural imports, including chicken, pork, soy and beef, starting next week, China's finance ministry announced.\n\nMexico has also stepped up law enforcement pressure on drug cartels, staging raids against fentanyl labs and arresting gang leaders. Last month, Mexico transferred 29 cartel leaders into U.S. custody.\n\nSpeaking on Tuesday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her country, too, would retaliate with 25% tariffs on U.S. goods.\n\n\"There is no motive or reason, nor justification that supports this decision that will affect our people and our nations,\" she said.\n\nSheinbaum said she would detail which American products and industries would be targeted on Sunday.\n\nData from U.S. Customs and Border Protection shows fentanyl seizures at the U.S.-Mexico border have dropped by roughly 50% in recent months.\n\nThis escalating trade fight comes at a time when fatal overdoses from fentanyl are plunging in the U.S., with deaths linked to the synthetic opioid down more than 30% over the last year, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

        "full_text": "California Attorney General Rob Bonta on Monday announced charges against 30 detention services officers who allegedly oversaw “gladiator fights” between minors at a juvenile detention facility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis development comes after leaked video footage showing one of the fights went viral on social media. The officers are facing a slew of charges, including “child endangerment and abuse, conspiracy, and battery,” according to a press release.\n\nThe indictment alleges that the officers allowed and, in some instances, encouraged 69 fights to occur between youths at Los Padrinos during the period from July 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023. The indictment stems from an investigation launched by the California Department of Justice after video footage of one of the so-called \"gladiator fights\" leaked in January 2024. Twenty-two of the 30 officers were arraigned today at Los Angeles Superior Court. The remaining officers will be arraigned on April 18, 2025.\n\nBonta said correctional officers “have a duty to ensure the safety and well-being of those under their care” and that the defendants “did just the opposite – overseeing ‘gladiator fights’ when they should have intervened.”\n\nThe video footage showed multiple youths taking turns punching and kicking a teenager in a “day room” in the facility. The officers can be seen standing around doing nothing to stop the assault. Some of them laughed and shook hands with the juveniles involved in the violence.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times obtained a copy of the video after the 17-year-old victim’s attorney requested that he be released before his upcoming trial because he was not safe at the facility.\n\nThe indictment alleges that the officers not only allowed the fights to occur – they actively supported it. One inmate suffered a broken nose and head trauma.\n\nThe officers allegedly doctored reports to give alternate explanations for the injuries the juveniles sustained from the fights. Officer Taneha Brooks in a report characterized one of the more severe assaults as a mutual fight that she stopped after intervening. Yet, the video footage clearly shows her doing nothing.\n\nLos Padrinos Juvenile Hall has an extensive history of safety violations and operational problems, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nCalifornia’s Board of State and Community Corrections ordered Los Padrinos closed late last year after it repeatedly failed inspections and was deemed “unsuitable” to house youths. The majority of the juveniles incarcerated in Los Angeles County are housed in Los Padrinos because the board previously shuttered the county’s other two juvenile halls — Barry J. Nidorf in Sylmar and Central Juvenile Hall in L.A. — following increases in violence and instability in the halls exacerbated by a staffing crisis.\n\nThe probation department refused the state’s order to close Los Padrinos, and state board members have said they don’t know what legal recourse they have to enforce it. The California Attorney General’s office has previously declined to address the issue.\n\nLos Angeles County Superior Court Judge Miguel Espinoza is weighing a request from the L.A. County public defender’s office to remove all of its clients from Los Padrinos, based on the board’s finding that its unsafe for youths.\n\n“The probation system and its underlying culture are broken,” Los Angeles County Public Defender Ricardo Garcia said in a statement Monday. “Accountability for those who have failed to protect our youth is long overdue—there is no justice in a system that abuses the very youth it is entrusted to care for.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe LA County Probation department released a statement in which it claimed “accountability is a cornerstone of our mission, and we have zero tolerance for misconduct of any peace officers, especially those dealing with young people in our system.”",

        "full_text": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that government spending could be separated from gross domestic product reports, in response to questions about whether the spending cuts pushed by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency could possibly cause an economic downturn.\n\n“You know that governments historically have messed with GDP,” Lutnick said on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.” “They count government spending as part of GDP. So I’m going to separate those two and make it transparent.”\n\nDoing so could potentially complicate or distort a fundamental measure of the U.S. economy’s health. Government spending is traditionally included in the GDP because changes in taxes, spending, deficits and regulations by the government can impact the path of overall growth. GDP reports already include extensive details on government spending, offering a level of transparency for economists.\n\nMusk’s efforts to downsize federal agencies could result in the layoffs of tens of thousands of federal workers, whose lost income could potentially reduce their spending, affecting businesses and the economy at large.\n\nAP AUDIO: The Trump administration may exclude government spending from GDP, obscuring the impact of DOGE cuts\n\nAP correspondent Julie Walker reports the Trump administration may exclude government spending from GDP, obscuring the impact of DOGE cuts.\n\nThe commerce secretary’s remarks echoed Musk’s arguments made Friday on X that government spending doesn’t create value for the economy.\n\n“A more accurate measure of GDP would exclude government spending,” Musk wrote on his social media platform. “Otherwise, you can scale GDP artificially high by spending money on things that don’t make people’s lives better.”\n\nThe argument as articulated so far by Trump administration officials appears to play down the economic benefits created by some forms of government spending that can shape an economy’s trajectory.\n\n“If the government buys a tank, that’s GDP,” Lutnick said Sunday. “But paying 1,000 people to think about buying a tank is not GDP. That is wasted inefficiency, wasted money. And cutting that, while it shows in GDP, we’re going to get rid of that.”\n\nThe Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis published its most recent GDP report on Thursday, showing that the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.3% in the final three months of last year.\n\nThe report makes it possible to measure the forces driving the economy, showing that the gains at the end of last year were largely driven by greater consumer spending and an upward revision to federal government spending related to defense. Still, the federal government’s component of the GDP report for all of 2024 increased at 2.6%, slightly lower than overall economic growth last year of 2.8%.\n\nIn the GDP report, government spending accounts for almost one-fifth of people’s personal income, which totaled more than $24.6 trillion last year. This includes Social Security payments, benefits for military veterans, Medicare and Medicaid and other programs. But the report also measures the amount of people’s personal incomes that are paid in taxes to the government.\n\nThe government is not always a contributor to GDP growth and can subtract from it, which is what happened in 2022 as pandemic-related aid expired.\n\nLutnick said that the Trump administration would balance the federal budget with spending cuts, saying that would help growth and reduce the interest rates paid by consumers.\n\n“When we balance the budget of the United States of America, interest rates are going to come smashing down,” Lutnick said. “This is going to be the best economy anybody’s ever seen. And to bet against it is foolish.”",

        "full_text": "The Supreme Court will hear arguments Tuesday in a $10 billion lawsuit Mexico filed against top firearm manufacturers in the U.S., alleging their business practices have fueled cartel gun violence.\n\nThe gun makers reject those claims. They appealed to the Supreme Court to overturn a ruling that let the lawsuit move forward even though U.S. law largely shields gun makers from lawsuits.\n\nDepending on how the court rules, it could also affect a narrow legal path that helped families of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School secure a $73 million settlement from the gun maker Remington.\n\nHere’s what to know about the case:\n\nMexico has strict gun laws and has just one store where people can legally buy firearms. But thousands of guns are smuggled in by the country’s powerful drug cartels.\n\nThe Mexican government says 70% of those weapons come from the United States. The lawsuit claims that companies knew weapons were being sold to traffickers who smuggled them into Mexico and decided to cash in on that market.\n\nThe defendants include big-name manufacturers such as Smith & Wesson, Beretta, Colt and Glock. The lawsuit is still in its early stages, and if the court does side with Mexico it would still have to prove the allegations.\n\nThe gun makers say there is no evidence the industry allows trafficking and they disagree with Mexico’s data about how many weapons originate in the U.S. The Mexican government, not U.S. gun makers, is responsible for enforcing the laws and fighting crime, they argue.\n\nThe industry is shielded from most civil lawsuits arising from crimes committed using firearms under a 20-year-old law, though Mexico has argued that it doesn’t apply to crimes committed outside of the U.S.\n\nThe gun companies are asking the justices to overturn an appeals court ruling that allowed the case to move forward.\n\nThe 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found it fell under an exception to the shield law for situations in which firearm companies are accused of knowingly violating the law.\n\nThat exception has come up in other cases.\n\nThe victims of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook argued it applied to their lawsuit because the gun maker had violated state law in the marketing of the AR-15 rifle used in the shooting, in which 20 first graders and six educators were killed.\n\nThe Supreme Court declined to hear that case. After reaching the $73 million settlement, the families said they hoped it would lead to more safety and accountability.\n\nDepending on how the justices rule, their eventual findings could narrow or close that legal path.",

        "full_text": "Investors entered the New Year cheerful about the prospects of a business- and crypto-friendly Trump administration. Yet two months into 2025, US stocks have lagged Europe and Chinese stocks, bitcoin is sliding and concerns about inflation are mounting.\n\nUS stocks largely slid Tuesday as investors digested a poor outlook from a consumer confidence survey that showed heightened concern about inflation. The Conference Board’s consumer confidence index saw its largest monthly decline since August 2021.\n\nThe Dow wavered Tuesday morning but closed at 43,621, or 0.37% higher, after rising in afternoon trading. The benchmark S&P 500 closed lower by about 0.47% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 1.35%.\n\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed lower for the fourth session in a row. All three major US stock indexes are in the red since President Donald Trump took office on January 20; the Nasdaq is down more than 1% since the start of 2025.\n\nUS stocks had rallied after Trump’s reelection in November and the S&P 500 closed at a record high just last week. Yet US markets are fretting as signs of lingering inflation are on the rise and uncertainty around Trump’s trade and tariff policy persists. Investor sentiment on Tuesday moved into extreme fear territory for the first time since December, according to CNN’s Fear & Greed Index.\n\nAs investors brace for uncertainty, they are likely moving away from stocks into safer assets like government bonds and dumping risky assets like cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, which surged as high as $106,000 around Trump’s inauguration, is down about 16% in the past month, trading around $88,000 on Tuesday.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year US Treasury slid to 4.29% on Tuesday as investors piled into bonds, signaling concerns about uncertainty and weaker-than-expected economic growth.\n\nWalmart, a bellwether for the US economy, spooked investors last week after it signaled slower sales in 2025 than previously expected.\n\nThe VIX, Wall Street’s fear gauge, surged Tuesday to its highest level this year before retreating.\n\nWhile US stocks might be stretched, global markets are shining. Europe’s STOXX 600 Index has gained almost 10% this year. In China, equities continue to outperform the US.\n\n“The release of DeepSeek’s LLM has reignited interest in China tech (now up over 35% from its January low), while the developments around Ukraine are triggering a surge in performance for European tech companies and companies exposed to potential reconstruction,” analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a February 25 note.\n\nTesting the bull market\n\nThe Dow and the broader S&P 500 have gained since Trump’s reelection in November and are still slightly in the green since the start of 2025.\n\nYet the S&P 500 posted back-to-back gains of more than 20% in 2023 and 2024, raising questions about whether the bull rally can continue in 2025.\n\nTech stocks, which pushed US indexes higher in 2024, have wavered in recent days. Nvidia (NVDA), Palantir (PLTR) and Tesla (TSLA) were leading the selloff in stocks on Tuesday. Palantir, a star of 2024, has fallen about 30% in the past five days.\n\nTesla shares tumbled 8.4% on Tuesday, bringing the company’s market value below the $1 trillion mark.\n\nTwo out of three traders believe the market is overvalued, according to Charles Schwab’s quarterly trader client sentiment survey. Yet bullish traders still outnumber bearish traders 51% to 34%.\n\n“It’s clear that the majority of traders believe there’s some froth in the market, but on balance they also feel like there’s still more room for the bulls to run,” said James Kostulias, head of trading services at Charles Schwab.\n\nWhile there is looming uncertainty, some strategists think fundamentals like strong corporate earnings will drive stocks higher.\n\n“While we continue to expect volatility ahead as investors grapple with the potential impact of Trump’s proposed policies, we believe markets are likely to refocus on fundamentals that should support the equity rally further,” said Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note Tuesday.",

American students will be permanently expelled or, depending on on the crime, arrested. NO MASKS! Thank you for your attention to this matter,” he added.\n\nTrump has leveraged federal funding several times already as a way to shape policy in schools, universities, and college campuses.\n\nRELATED — Mostly Peaceful! Bottles, Chair Thrown at NYPD During NYU Anti-Israel Protest\n\nFor instance, as Breitbart News first reported, Trump signed an executive order last month halting funding for schools and universities that impose coronavirus vaccine mandates on students.\n\nThe order would prohibit “federal funds from being used to support or subsidize an educational service agency, state education agency, local education agency, elementary school, secondary school, or institution of higher education that requires students to have received a COVID-19 vaccination to attend in-person education programs,” a White House document read.\n\nTrump also signed an executive order to defund K-12 schools that teach transgender ideology and critical race theory, as Breitbart News noted:\n\nThe order will give the Department of Education 90 days to create a plan about how to weed out CRT and radical gender ideology instruction in K-12 schools, according to a White House memo first obtained by the Daily Caller. Trump notably promised on the campaign trail to sign an order defunding schools that teach “Critical Race Theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content.”\n\nThe White House memo also reportedly states that the order will direct the Attorney General to work with state attorneys general and district attorneys “to file actions against teachers and school officials who sexually exploit minors or practice medicine without a license through ‘social transition’ practices.”\n\nTrump’s announcement Tuesday comes after college campuses and universities across the country were sites of pro-Hamas and anti-Israel protests during the end of the Biden administration.",

For the dozens of high-level officials President Trump has fired in violation of clear legal restrictions, he is likely to be at least somewhat vindicated by a Supreme Court that has been increasingly skeptical of laws limiting the president’s ability to fire at will.\n\nBut Mr. Trump is on decidedly shakier ground when it comes to how he has empowered Elon Musk, who is perhaps the most important figure in the new administration based on the efforts taken to reshape the federal government through his Department of Government Efficiency initiative. That’s most likely why the White House has tied itself in knots trying to explain to courts and to the public the nature of Mr. Musk’s role. Presumably, that’s because it seems clear that the Constitution does not allow it.\n\nThat’s true at the level of broad constitutional principles — particularly the principle that sovereignty flows from the people and that only officials selected through constitutional methods get to wield power in our name. This insight seems to undergird the growing mobilization against Elon Musk. Protesters at Tesla showrooms who are displaying signs that say “no one voted for Elon Musk” are making, intentionally or not, a constitutionally inflected claim.\n\nMr. Musk’s power also is squarely at odds with concrete constitutional provisions. While the Constitution is largely silent on removal — Mr. Trump’s arguments that the Constitution gives him limitless power to fire are atextual — the document is quite specific when it comes to appointment.\n\nSupreme Court cases make clear that individuals who serve in “continuing” positions and who exercise “significant authority” on behalf of the United States must be appointed consistent with the Constitution’s Appointments Clause. As far as I can tell, Mr. Musk hasn’t been.\n\nThe Appointments Clause — part of Article II, the source of Mr. Trump’s virtually boundless conception of presidential power — sets forth two methods of appointment of what are called “officers of the United States.” “Principal” officers must be nominated by the president and are subject to the advice and consent of the Senate. For “inferior officers,” the Constitution allows Congress to give the appointment power to the president alone — that is, without Senate confirmation — or to the head of a department, or to the courts of law. Inferior officers must be subject to the supervision of someone other than the president; if you report directly to the president, you’re a principal officer.\n\nThis means that the individuals who wield the most authority — principal officers — are subject to both the public scrutiny and the check that is supposed to be imposed by Senate confirmation.\n\nMr. Musk appears to be wielding significant power, as evidenced by his presence at the administration’s first cabinet meeting last week. He was the first to speak after the president’s introduction. He boasted about pushing federal employees to respond to an email about their work, inveighed about the federal deficit and casually disclosed that his team had inadvertently canceled funding for Ebola prevention — an error he claims was quickly rectified, but may not have been. The email he mentioned appears to have been dashed off without advance warning even to the cabinet.\n\nThe Supreme Court has found that a range of government workers exercise enough authority that they are officers and must be appointed through one of the methods outlined in the Constitution — including many who exercise far less authority than Mr. Musk appears to. In 2018, for example, the court held that administrative law judges at the Securities and Exchange Commission were officers of the United States. In a more recent decision, the court explained that “thousands of officers wield executive power” on the president’s behalf, power that “acquires its legitimacy and accountability to the public through ‘a clear and effective chain of command’ down from the president.”\n\nIndeed, the main basis on which Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the classified-documents case against Mr. Trump was that the special counsel Jack Smith was an officer of the United States who had not been constitutionally appointed. The specifics of her conclusion were highly dubious — but she was right that “the Appointments Clause is a critical constitutional restriction stemming from the separation of powers.”\n\nTwo legal cases are making the argument that Mr. Musk’s power cannot be squared with the Appointments Clause. They contend that if Mr. Musk is as powerful as he seems to be, he must be appointed consistent with the Constitution — and he’s most likely a principal officer, which means Senate confirmation.\n\nOne case, in Maryland, was brought by a group of current and former federal employees and contractors; another, in Washington, D.C., was brought by a number of states. In a hearing last week, the judge in the Maryland case, Theodore Chuang, said that he was “highly suspicious” of the administration’s explanation for Mr. Musk’s role and characterized its insistence that he has no formal role in the Department of Government Efficiency as apparently “factually inaccurate.”\n\nThe district judge in the Washington case has made clear that allegations suggest that Mr. Musk has “rapidly taken steps to fundamentally reshape the executive branch,” with no apparent “source of legal authority.” His actions appear to describe “precisely the ‘executive abuses’ that the Appointments Clause seeks to prevent.”\n\nBased on well-settled principles, these claims should succeed in the cases. The decisions are unlikely to invalidate what has been done to the federal government by those involved in Mr. Musk’s initiative — but they should say that Mr. Musk cannot continue to exercise this authority without a constitutionally permissible appointment.\n\nThere is no small irony in Mr. Musk’s exercising this amount of extraconstitutional authority. Mr. Trump’s allies have consistently alluded to the principle of democratic legitimacy in their broadsides against the administrative state. When Mr. Musk laid out the principles of DOGE in an opinion essay, written with Vivek Ramaswamy, they said that “most government enforcement decisions and discretionary expenditures aren’t made by the democratically elected president or even his political appointees” but by people who were, they stressed, “unelected” and “unappointed.” This, they said, is “antidemocratic and antithetical to the founders’ vision.”\n\nThe system the founders created includes clear requirements for ensuring legitimacy and accountability in positions of significant government power. Americans should insist that if President Trump wants Mr. Musk in government, there’s a way to do that: appoint him as the Constitution requires.",

        "full_text": "WASHINGTON — Congress is careening toward a government shutdown in just 11 days as the discord between the two parties over funding talks grows, with no clear path to reach a deal.\n\nThe government is set to run out of money at the end of next Friday, March 14. Republicans control the House and the Senate, but they need Democratic support to pass a funding bill as it is subject to the Senate's 60-vote threshold.\n\nHopes of a full funding deal have faded, so President Donald Trump and congressional leaders are falling back on a short-term bill to keep the government open on autopilot, most likely through the end of the fiscal year. But even that is running into obstacles.\n\n\"I'm not optimistic. I don't think we're going to have a budget,\" said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. \"My Democratic colleagues have been insistent that we include language limiting the involvement of the executive branch on spending decisions.\"\n\nDemocrats have pushed to include constraints on Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk's attempts to close down or slash agencies without congressional approval. But Republicans say that's a nonstarter as they support the Department of Government Efficiency-led budget cuts, which they say are about rooting out waste.\n\n\"Democrats have to help negotiate this, and they've to this point shown no interest in finding a reasonable solution for that,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nJohnson called for a measure \"to freeze funding at current levels, to make sure that the government can stay open while we begin to incorporate all these savings that we're finding through the DOGE effort and these other sources of revenue that President Trump's policies are bringing to the table.\"\n\nIn a statement Sunday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Democrats are interested in a deal that \"promotes the economic well-being, health and safety of everyday Americans.\" But he added that \"there has been zero outreach from the Trump administration and House Republicans have walked away from the negotiating table.\"\n\nThe White House sent Congress a request for add-ons to the bill — or \"anomalies\" — that include $32 billion in transfer authority for the Defense Department, which some Democrats consider a slush fund. The request includes a $20 billion cut to IRS enforcement and an increase in funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation operations. The document was viewed by NBC News and authenticated by two sources.\n\n\"I think the White House anomaly requests are completely inadequate,\" Sen. Patty Murray, of Washington, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said Monday when she was asked about the request. \"And again, the solution is in front of us: short-term CR, tell our committee to get to work. Democrats are at the table. We are ready to do that.\"\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the chair of the Appropriations Committee, told NBC News on Monday that she's \"working on a two-track approach\" that includes a full-year continuing resolution and a short-term bill of \"maybe a month\" to give more time for a detailed agreement.\n\nFor Johnson, the first question is whether he can find enough votes to pass a stopgap bill in the House with a narrow GOP majority of 218-215. That may require Democratic votes as scores of conservative Republicans routinely vote against funding the government.\n\nOrdinarily, Democrats support short-term bills en masse. But this time, the GOP's insistence on protecting or codifying the cuts by DOGE has given Democrats a point of opposition to rally around — after they've seen grassroots anger from federal workers and veterans. Democrats see the Trump-Musk effort as trampling on Congress' power over spending, and some say they won't support a bill that would let it continue.\n\nIn addition, at least two moderate House Republicans have already blasted the idea of another continuing resolution.\n\nRep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, argued that Congress needs to pass regular appropriation bills rather than kick the can down the road with a CR.\n\n\"I am a NO on the CR. Congress needs to do its job and pass a conservative budget!\" he wrote on X. \"CR's are code for Continued Rubberstamp of fraud, waste, and abuse.\"\n\nRep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., an Afghanistan and Iraq war veteran, slammed the CR, saying it wouldn't allow for much-needed additional military funding.\n\n\"A continuing resolution (CR) is bad for our military and weakens our national security,\" Bacon wrote Sunday on X, without saying how he'd vote. \"A CR means new weapons programs cannot get started. A year-long CR means we are not serious about building a military that will deter China, Russia and Iran.\"\n\nBut Bacon said Monday that White House officials reached out to him after his post and acknowledged that \"anomalies\" were needed to \"plus-up\" military spending.\n\nJohnson huddled with his GOP leadership team as lawmakers returned to the Capitol on Monday evening and got support for the CR plan.\n\nRep. Andy Harris, R-Md., the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, said he was on board, even though the stopgap measure doesn't codify the DOGE cuts cheered by the ultraconservative group. All Freedom Caucus members voted last week to pass a budget resolution that calls for raising the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.\n\n\"I think we're charting new territory here with President Trump and his striving to get government efficiency going,\" Harris said as he left the speaker's office.\n\nAsked whether he's worried about a shutdown, Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., a Freedom Caucus member, replied: \"Nah.\"\n\n\"This town is very interesting. Deals seem to, like, fall out of the sky when they need to,\" Donalds told NBC News while saying \"the Dems are being ridiculous\" by opposing DOGE cuts.\n\nRepublicans are seeking to juggle a funding bill with an unrelated effort to pass a huge party-line package to advance parts of Trump's agenda, which has drawn unified Democratic opposition.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said Democrats will continue \"telling the truth about what the Republicans are trying to do\" and said it's the majority party's job to make a serious offer.\n\n\"The Republicans have the majority,\" Warren told reporters Monday. \"They need to put forward a package that can pass the House and the Senate. That's their job.\"",

Subscribe here.\n\nWelcome to the Logoff. Today I’m covering another purge at the Justice Department, where Donald Trump’s administration is taking revenge against high-ranking career prosecutors who prosecuted Trump allies over January 6 and in other criminal cases.\n\nWhat’s the latest? The head of the Washington, DC, US attorney’s office demoted seven high-ranking prosecutors on Friday, Reuters reports, moving them to entry-level positions in a bid to force them to quit. Those demoted include:\n\nThe leader of the “Capitol siege prosecution unit”\n\nA prosecutor who worked on criminal cases against Trump advisers Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro\n\nProsecutors who worked on criminal cases against the heads of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, two far-right extremist groups that worked to steal the 2020 election on Trump’s behalf\n\nThe experienced attorneys will now mostly handle misdemeanors and low-level crimes. The demotions follow the January firing of US attorneys who prosecuted Trump over his attempt to steal the 2020 election.\n\nWhy were they demoted? Ed Martin, the Trump-appointed new head of the DC office, claimed the moves reflected a shift in priorities and a focus on local crime in DC. But the Trump-related experiences of the officials selected — and the move of experienced prosecutors to entry-level jobs — make it difficult to believe this wasn’t an act of retribution.\n\nThe Logoff\n\nThe email you need to stay informed about Trump — without letting the news take over your life, from senior editor Patrick Reis.\n\nEmail (required)\n\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

The demotions send a strong signal to prosecutors that there will be consequences for officials who try to hold Trump and his allies accountable to the law. It’s also another blow against the DOJ’s independence, as Trump works to remake law enforcement as a tool he can wield for political ends. And the move weakens the US attorney’s office in Washington, which is tasked with prosecuting abuses of power by some of the country’s most powerful people.\n\nAnd with that, it’s time to log off…\n\nVox’s Gray Area podcast this week is about the science of changing one’s own personality — how, why, and if one should endeavor to fix the parts of ourselves that we don’t like.

Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,\" Trump said in an address to Congress on Tuesday while quoting from the letter. Trump also said he had been in \"serious discussions with Russia\" and had \"received strong signals that they are ready for peace\". \"Wouldn't that be beautiful?\" he said. \"It's time to stop this madness. It's time to halt the killing. It's time to end this senseless war. If you want to end wars you have to talk to both sides.\" Trump was expected to further outline his plans for Ukraine and Russia in the speech to Congress , but did not reveal any further details on how he plans to end Europe's biggest conflict since World War Two. Trump said Ukraine was ready to sign a minerals deal with the U.S., which Washington says is crucial to secure continued U.S. backing for Ukraine's defense. Four sources told Reuters that the Trump administration and Ukraine plan to sign the deal in return for military aid, which Trump has paused. But later on Tuesday U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News, \"There is no signing planned,\" according to a post on X by a Fox reporter. Trump gave no further details on the minerals deal, leaving its fate unclear. Early on Tuesday, Zelenskiy pledged to repair relations with the U.S. after what he described as a \"regrettable\" Oval Office clash with Trump last week. Zelenskiy said he wanted to \"make things right\" and was ready \"any time and in any convenient format\" to sign the minerals deal, which he left on the table during a visit to Washington after the Oval Office argument with Trump. His statement came a day after Trump halted military aid to Ukraine, his latest move to upend U.S. policy and adopt a more conciliatory stance toward Russia. \"My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump’s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts,\" Zelenskiy said in his statement on X. The statement made no mention of the pause in U.S. military supplies. Zelenskiy's statement was clearly aimed at stressing Kyiv's gratitude following the explosive confrontation at the White House, at which Trump and Vice President JD Vance scolded Zelenskiy as insufficiently appreciative. \"We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence,\" Zelenskiy wrote. \"Our meeting in Washington ... did not go the way it was supposed to be. It is regrettable that it happened this way. It is time to make things right.\" Zelenskiy outlined a path towards a peace agreement, which he said could begin with a release of prisoners and a halt to air and sea attacks, if Russia did the same. \"Then we want to move very fast through all next stages and to work with the U.S. to agree a strong final deal.\" U.S. President Donald Trump meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 28, 2025.

REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo , GEOPOLITICAL SHIFT Earlier, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukraine's forces could hold their own on the battlefield against Russian troops, but that Kyiv would do everything possible to continue cooperating with the U.S. \"We will continue to work with the U.S. through all available channels in a calm manner,\" Shmyhal said. \"We only have one plan - to win and to survive.\" In Moscow, the Kremlin said cutting off U.S. military aid to Ukraine was the best possible step towards peace, although it was waiting to confirm Trump's move. U.S. Democrats have raised an outcry over Trump's abrupt pivot towards Russia, the most dramatic geopolitical shift in generations for Washington, where governments under both parties since the 1940s have prioritized defending Europe from a hostile Moscow. The chart shows the five donors that have allocated the most bilateral aid to Ukraine across sectors between Jan. 24, 2022 to Dec. 31, 2024. PRESSURE ON EUROPE The pause in U.S. military aid puts more pressure on European allies who have publicly embraced Zelenskiy since the Oval Office blow-up. Britain and France, whose leaders both visited the White House last week, have offered troops to help guard a potential ceasefire. On Tuesday, Germany's conservatives and Social Democrats announced proposals to set up a 500 billion euro ($531 billion) fund to help ramp up defence spending. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen unveiled proposals to mobilise up to 800 billion euros for EU defence spending. The 27-nation bloc holds an emergency summit on Thursday. French President Emmanuel Macron's office said the president had spoken with both the U.S. and Ukrainian leaders and welcomed Zelenskiy's will to re-engage with Trump. But French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou was sharply critical of Trump's move to pause military supplies. \"Suspending aid during a war to a country under attack means abandoning the country under attack and accepting or hoping that the aggressor will win,\" he said during a parliamentary debate. Ukrainians were stunned and many described Washington's move as a betrayal. Oleksandr Merezhko, head of the Ukrainian parliament's foreign affairs committee, said it looked like Trump was \"pushing us towards capitulation\". \"Yes, it is betrayal, let's call it like it is,\" said lawyer Olena Bilova, 47, in Kyiv. \"But let's hope that American civil society and the elites of the European Union will not leave us alone.\" ($1 = 0.9418 euros) Reporting by Olena Harmash and Yuliia Dysa, Andrea Shalal, Gram Slattery; Additional reporting by Idrees Ali, Erin Banco, Steve Holland, Lidia Kelly, Mike Stone, Jasper Ward, Patricia Zengerle and Pavel Polityuk; Writing by James Oliphant, Peter Graff, Alex Richardson, Nia Williams and Michael Perry; Editing by David Gregorio and Stephen Coates . , Erin Banco Thomson Reuters Erin Banco is a national security correspondent focusing on the intelligence community.

        "full_text": "Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans are accusing one another of “lying” about what a House Republican budget resolution means for Medicaid, and both sides have made misleading or speculative comments. There’s little doubt the health care program would face cuts under the plan — and it would have to if Medicare cuts are off limits.\n\nDemocrats have seized on the resolution’s call for the Energy and Commerce Committee to cut $880 billion in spending over 10 years. The committee’s options for those reductions are almost entirely in spending for Medicaid, a federal-state program that provides health care for low-income people, and Medicare, the federal program that covers seniors.\n\nRepublicans have said the legislation doesn’t pinpoint any specific changes to Medicaid, which is correct but sidesteps the reality that the bulk of the spending cuts would likely be to that program. Democrats, meanwhile, have speculated that hospitals and nursing homes will close, impacts that aren’t known without details of how federal spending will be trimmed and how states will react.\n\nThe resolution that narrowly passed the House on Feb. 25 along party lines has several legislative hurdles to overcome before any spending cuts materialize. Most notably, it still needs to pass the Senate, where some Republicans want to change the legislation. The budget resolution is the first step to Congress using a maneuver called reconciliation to extend the 2017 tax cuts, most of which are set to expire at the end of this year. Reconciliation enables a tax and spending bill to pass the Senate with a simple majority, rather than 60 votes.\n\nThe House resolution lays out the broad parameters of extending the 2017 tax cut provisions and enacting some new cuts, at a cost of $4.5 trillion over 10 years, and reducing government spending by $2 trillion over the same time period. Both houses of Congress need to agree on this or another budget framework before lawmakers can then propose legislation on the specific ways they would cut and spend their way to those figures. (See slide 11 here for a flowchart on the process from the Committee on a Responsible Federal Budget.)\n\nWe’ll go through several claims about the resolution.\n\nSize of Medicaid Cuts\n\nLawmakers have made conflicting statements about how much would need to be cut from Medicaid under the House resolution.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Pete Aguilar, Feb. 25 press conference: Now some of our friends on the other side of the aisle will say, “This is just a procedural step. Please don’t hold this vote against me.” Here’s the truth: This vote doesn’t just open the door for Medicaid cuts, it guarantees them.\n\nRepublican Rep. Steve Scalise, Feb. 25 press conference: The word Medicaid is not even in this bill. This bill doesn’t even mention the word Medicaid a single time. And yet, all Democrats are doing is lying about what’s in the budget because they don’t want to talk about the truth of what we’re voting to start.\n\nAs we said, the Senate would still need to pass the resolution, and lawmakers then would need to agree on the specific spending cuts. But Aguilar has a point that the $880 billion would have to touch Medicaid, unless lawmakers wanted to find the reductions in Medicare — which may be even more politically challenging. Plus, House Republicans already have talked about some options for Medicaid cuts, such as adding work requirements and finding efficiencies in the program.\n\nScalise is correct in saying the legislation doesn’t include the word “Medicaid.” But, again, there’s little doubt that the program would face spending reductions — and they could be substantial, as we’ll explain.\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan budget watchdog group, said in a Feb. 20 post that “it would likely be nearly impossible to meet the [$880 billion] target without including some Medicaid reductions.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Brendan Boyle, Feb. 25 press conference: If Energy and Commerce Committee said, “We don’t want to cut Medicaid, instead we will cut literally everything else we possibly can 100%,” that only gets you about halfway to the $880 billion. So, by definition, they have to, as a minimum, cut hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicaid.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Feb. 27 press conference: Republicans are lying to the American people about Medicaid. The Republican budget authorizes up to $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid by directing the Energy and Commerce Committee to find those spending cuts. Everybody knows who has had any connection to the congressional budget that if you are directing the Energy and Commerce Committee to find up to $880 billion, if not more, in spending cuts, that means Medicaid.\n\nAll $880 billion over 10 years doesn’t have to come out of Medicaid, as Jeffries suggested in a Feb. 27 news conference, but Boyle is correct that there’s no way to get around sizable cuts to Medicaid — unless, again, lawmakers turn to cutting Medicare.\n\nOn Jan. 27, President Donald Trump said he would again “pledge,” as he did repeatedly during the campaign: “I will not sign any bill that cuts even a single penny from Medicare or Social Security for our great seniors.” He has said similar things about Medicaid, though he has left open the possibility of cutting waste or “fraud” from all three programs.\n\nRobin Rudowitz, a vice president and director for the program on Medicaid and the uninsured at KFF, a health policy research group, told us that “the large majority” of the $880 billion “is likely to come out of Medicaid,” and if Medicare cuts are off the table, there’s “no other way to get to that magnitude of savings” without Medicaid cuts.\n\nCJ Young, a spokesperson for the Democrats on the Energy and Commerce Committee told us: “Of the funding that’s available for the Committee to cut, approximately 98% percent of that is either Medicare or Medicaid funding. So if you take Trump at his word that he’s not touching Medicare, then the vast majority of the cuts will have to come out of the safety net health care program.”\n\nWe asked a spokesperson for the Republicans on the committee about this, but we haven’t received a response.\n\nIn breaking down the numbers of what the Energy and Commerce Committee can trim, the New York Times said that if the committee eliminates all non-health care spending, “it will still be more than $600 billion short” of that $880 billion target.\n\n“The reality is that this 880 number is targeting Energy and Commerce, and the place where they have the ability to make cuts is going to be in Medicaid,” Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, told us.\n\nMedicaid is jointly funded by the states and the federal government; the federal share over the next 10 years is estimated at $8.2 trillion. So, it would be about an 11% cut if all $880 billion came out of Medicaid.\n\nMedicare spending over 10 years is even higher — approximately $15.8 trillion, according to this New York Times analysis. The Energy and Commerce Committee oversees about another $600 billion that it could trim, including money for the Children’s Health Insurance Program.\n\nIf this budget resolution moves forward, the committee would have to find the entire $880 billion in deficit reduction, Chris Towner, CRFB’s policy director, told us in an email. “If push comes to shove and lawmakers don’t think they can meet those instructions, they would need to amend the budget resolution,” he said.\n\nImpact of Potential Cuts\n\nDemocrats have claimed that hospitals would close and people would lose health coverage, while Republicans have said any cuts would be to waste, fraud and abuse. Without the specifics on spending reductions, the impacts aren’t known, but experts told us that large cuts in federal funding would leave states with budget gaps and tough choices on what to do about them.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Frank Pallone, Feb. 25, CNBC: Well, I think the problem is that the Republican leadership is lying to the rank and file Republicans. In other words, they know that these Medicaid cuts will really take away health care from so many people and close hospitals and close nursing homes.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ted Lieu, Feb. 25 press conference: And what does $880 billion of Medicaid look like? It means the shutting down of community health clinics, the shutting down of hospitals, the shutting down of nursing homes.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, Feb. 27, CNN: We’re going to take care of those who are rightful beneficiaries of the programs. We’re going to cut the fraud, waste and abuse out of Medicaid, and that’s where we’re going to get part of the savings to accomplish this mission. … There’s about $50 billion estimated that are lost every year in Medicaid just in fraud alone.\n\nTrump, Feb. 26, Cabinet meeting: We’re not going to touch it [Medicaid, Medicare or Social Security]. Now, we are going to look for fraud. I’m sure you’re OK with that, like people that shouldn’t be on, people that are illegal aliens and others, criminals in many cases.\n\nMedicaid is funded jointly by states and the federal government, which provides matching funds of at least 50%, as KFF explains. An expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act provides a match of 90% in federal funding. About 21% of the U.S. population, or 83 million people, have Medicaid coverage, including those with low income and disabilities, as well as seniors. Medicaid, not Medicare, covers long-term care expenses for the elderly.\n\nRudowitz at KFF told us that changes the federal government makes to Medicaid financing “really gets transferred to the states,” which then “have to figure out how they’re going to respond to those cuts.” She said states could raise revenue, make cuts to other parts of their budgets or cut their Medicaid programs — and the latter option could mean cutting coverage or benefits, or the payment rates to health care providers. “All states might respond differently,” she said.\n\nShe noted that while most of Medicaid’s enrollees are children and adults, most of the spending is for people with disabilities and seniors, because of their high health care costs.\n\nCuello at Georgetown told us an $880 billion cut is “gigantic” and “orders of magnitude too large to not be destructive.” He, too, said that the “final cuts might be made by states.”\n\n“So in other words, you might reduce state funding by some gigantic number, and then the state has to react to that, and we can’t predict, we can’t tell you exactly what they’re going to do,” Cuello said.\n\nWe asked if he thought the potential impact would be as severe as community health centers, hospitals or nursing homes closing, as Democrats have claimed. “Yes, I do,” he said. “I don’t think we can predict that that is going to happen exactly in every state. Those things are the downstream consequences.”\n\nCuello noted that rural hospital closure is already a problem. “And if you defund the system … there are going to be hospitals that go over the brink,” he said.\n\nIn a Feb. 20 post, CRFB identified what it called “state financing gimmicks” that it said could be changed or eliminated to save federal dollars. It said that “incremental policy changes could improve the integrity of the Medicaid program and prevent states from unfairly gaming Medicaid’s financing laws while also leading to savings.” One example is lowering or banning Medicaid provider taxes, which are now capped at 6%.\n\n“As we have discussed, states often tax providers up to 6 percent of providers’ revenue and then use those funds to remit payments back to providers, reporting the payments to the federal government in the process to collect matching funds,” which “essentially” boosts the Medicaid match, CRFB said. It estimated savings of $240 billion to $610 billion over a decade if provider taxes were restricted or eliminated, respectively.\n\nTowner told us his organization’s post showed that “finding Medicaid savings also does not necessarily mean slashing Medicaid or even benefits – there are lots of non-benefit savings options available that could be used to fulfill this savings.”\n\nRudowitz and Cuello, however, said that a reduction in provider taxes would still leave states with a budget gap for their Medicaid programs. Some could argue that there should be more transparency and restrictions on provider taxes, Rudowitz said, but on the other side, “there are tradeoffs and consequences” to states getting less in federal matching funds.\n\nAs for Johnson’s and Trump’s claims about finding fraud, that’s unlikely to result in a sizable amount of savings — and certainly not $880 billion, these experts said. Johnson referred to $50 billion in fraud in Medicaid each year, but the Government Accountability Office estimated that amount for “improper payments” in fiscal year 2023 not solely “fraud.”\n\nThe GAO said that improper payments include overpayments and underpayments or payments that shouldn’t have been made. That can include fraud, “but not all improper payments are the result of fraud,” the report said. It didn’t give an estimate for fraud, saying that “estimates of improper payments cannot be used to determine the extent of fraud in a particular program.”\n\nJohnson’s office hasn’t responded to our inquiry about his claim.\n\nOften improper payments are missing some documents or paperwork, Rudowitz and Cuello said, and it doesn’t necessarily mean the payment shouldn’t have been made.\n\nAndy Schneider, also a research professor at Georgetown’s McCourt School of Public Policy, wrote a January blog post about Medicaid fraud. He said that fraud does occur — mostly on the part of unscrupulous providers, who, when caught, are charged with crimes. But there isn’t a good estimate of how much fraud there might be.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services also provides estimates on improper payments and recommendations on how to reduce them, Schneider explained. HHS’ fiscal year 2024 report estimated Medicaid’s improper payment rate at 5.09%, or $31.1 billion for the year. Of this amount, 74.3% was classified as improper due to “insufficient documentation.” The report said: “The insufficient documentation errors include claims where information was missing, or states did not follow appropriate processes to determine if a payment was proper or improper.”\n\nAs Schneider said, “had the information been available, the claim may have been payable (or not).”\n\nIn his interview on CNN on Feb. 27, Johnson said adding work requirements was one possibility for cutting Medicaid spending (which would save about $100 billion over 10 years, according to the Times). But a per-capita cap on funding or reducing the federal match (measures that would save hundreds of billions more) weren’t being considered, he said.\n\n“Look, everybody needs to watch the process play out,” Johnson said. “It’s going to take us five or six weeks, probably, to dig through all those details and come up with the final proposal.”",

        "full_text": "This time, it’s Democrats who are itching for a fight — over the Department of Government Efficiency cuts that Trump has blessed and deputized mogul Elon Musk has gleefully carried out.\n\nSenior House Democrats have spent recent days privately surveying their members about whether they’d be willing to shut the government down over DOGE cuts, according to multiple well-placed Democratic sources I spoke to over the weekend.\n\nSo far, they’re encountering little resistance.\n\nDemocrats of all persuasions, even some centrists who have long been firmly anti-shutdown, feel that voting for a “clean” spending bill would be tacitly blessing Musk’s controversial work. Denying Republicans the votes they’ll need to keep the agencies open, they believe, would be the lesser evil.\n\n“Nobody wants a shutdown, but they don’t feel like aiding and abetting what’s happening, with Musk and Trump taking a wrecking ball to health care in particular,” said one senior House Democratic aide, who like others I spoke to was granted anonymity to speak candidly about internal party conversations. “Why would we be complicit in that?”\n\nA senior Democratic lawmaker was blunter: “At some point you’ve got to have a goddamn backbone. I am not giving them a blank check until September.”\n\nThat’s a big pivot from just a few weeks ago. In early February, I pooh-poohed the left’s push to use the March 14 government funding deadline to make a stand against Musk — and then heard from a number of senior Democratic officials on both sides of the Capitol who privately agreed with my assessment.\n\nA Democrat-induced shutdown, they agreed, would backfire on their party politically and only empower Musk even more to slash and burn his way through federal agencies. And they were frustrated with the base for not seeming to understand that playing with fire wasn’t the answer.\n\nNow, with the funding deadline less than two weeks away?\n\n“People now feel like the more perilous position is giving votes without the perception there’s been any change in accountability,” a second senior House Democratic aide told me. “The incentive structure right now is not to provide votes for them.”\n\nSure, you can chalk some of the shift up to negotiating tactics. Democrats want Republicans to put some policy handcuffs on Musk, something Republicans are firmly rejecting. House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole called it “a non-starter and battle they lost to the American people” on Monday.\n\nAnd Democratic leaders have every reason to amp up pressure on their GOP counterparts to deliver as many votes as possible, given their control of the House, Senate and White House. No reason to make it easy on them, even if there’s no real shutdown threat, right?\n\nBut that’s not how House Democrats are talking, even in private. During a recent meeting between Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and his committee leaders, top appropriator Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut steamed about how Speaker Mike Johnson was going to try to make them swallow the clean funding extension.\n\n“No fucking way!” she shouted, a person in the room told me. Jeffries didn’t push back, and now his leadership team is gauging whether his members are willing to take this fight all the way.\n\nUsually shutdown saber-rattling originates on the fringes of the two parties and gains momentum until leaders just can’t ignore it, lest they risk their own jobs. This time, however, the foment is coming from the leadership table itself — where there is growing anger over the lightning-fast Trump-Musk campaign to gut federal agencies and the glacial pace of court action to stop it.\n\nSome senior House Democrats believe the impacts of the DOGE cuts have already created a shutdown of sorts and that passing a clean funding extension would effectively green-light the status quo and potentially undercut pending court cases challenging Trump and Musk.\n\nMoreover, I am told, Democrats have been emboldened by recent polling showing that the public has started to shift against DOGE, as Americans hear more about potentially losing benefits and veterans getting kicked out of jobs. That’s to say nothing of the recent town-hall protests, where Republican lawmakers took an earful from constituents raging against DOGE.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Democrats up and down the leadership chain are hearing not only from the liberal base but people they consider more mainstream — donors, strategists and constituents who believe they need to show some fight, and fast.\n\n“It’s very hard to go back to those people and say, ‘Yeah, I voted for the status quo here and did nothing to stand up,’” the second House Democratic aide said.\n\nWhat might be even harder for House Democrats, though, is figuring out an endgame.\n\nSay Democrats vote against a clean spending bill in the House and allow a shutdown to occur: Musk might have dismissed tens of thousands of federal workers, but Uncle Sam still employs more than 2 million more who would be furloughed without pay.\n\nAmid the finger-pointing, Republicans would call vote after vote to reopen government agencies — casting Democrats as the ones who are repeatedly choosing to keep agencies shut and employees home without paychecks.\n\nThat’s tough terrain to fight from, politically speaking, and especially tough when you consider how a shutdown might undercut Democrats’ core message right now — that Trump and Musk are undercutting the services and benefits that millions of Americans rely on.\n\nRight now, senior party leaders are posturing, trying to cast Republicans as the unreasonable ones. “The only one who wants a shutdown right now is Elon Musk,” Senate Appropriations Vice Chair Patty Murray of Washington said Monday, calling for a “short-term” stopgap instead of the six-month bill Trump and Johnson want.\n\nJeffries over the weekend accused GOP leaders of “walking away” from funding talks, arguing that it’s on the GOP alone to fund the government since they control everything.\n\nTop Democrats know as well as anyone that’s not exactly true: Appropriations has to be bipartisan given the 60-vote threshold in the Senate, which is the leverage they have long used to counter Republicans’ proposed spending cuts. And that argument isn’t the kind of resonant message that’s capable of ultimately winning over the public.\n\nBut it turns out Democrats might have learned a lesson from the most recent GOP-instigated shutdowns — the multi-week affairs seen in 2013 and 2019 waged over health care and border policy, respectively: Winning isn’t always the point — sometimes, when dealing with an angry base, you just have to tilt at the windmill.",

The Nasdaq is down about 6.5% since since Trump took office on January 20.\n\n“Tomorrow, tariffs — 25% on Canada and 25% on Mexico,” Trump said during a press conference at the White House. “And that’ll start. … What they have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United States, in which case they have no tariffs.”\n\nTrump said the two trading partners had “no room” left to negotiate to avoid the levies and that he was using tariffs to “punish” countries that, as he put it, were taking from the US economy without giving enough in return.\n\n“They’re all set. They go into effect tomorrow,” he said.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Ottawa would immediately respond with tariffs on $30 billion of US goods if the Trump administration’s measures go into effect.\n\n“Canada will not let this unjustified decision go unanswered,” he said in a statement.\n\nTrump also signed an executive order on Monday raising tariffs on imports from China to 20%, up from 10%. Trump said the tariffs, aimed at bringing China to the table on curtailing fentanyl entering the United States, will be raised because Beijing has not done enough to stem the flow of illegal drugs.\n\nThe VIX, Wall Street’s fear gauge, surged to its highest point this year after Trump’s comments.\n\n“Due to the uncertainty surrounding the tariffs, the stock market has erased the gains from the ‘Trump bump’ following the presidential election and the expected upward pressure on prices is giving investors pause,” said Gustavo Flores-Macias, a professor of government and public policy at Cornell University.\n\n“For investors, 2025 can still be a positive year for stocks, but it may take all year to realize gains. And they may be modest,” said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group.\n\n“I’m still a bull,” Bolvin said.\n\nThe import taxes Trump imposed are significant — the largest in US-China history. The initial tariffs, which went into effect February 4, set in motion tariffs on $1.4 trillion of imported goods. That’s more than triple the $380 billion worth of foreign goods that were hit with tariffs during Trump’s first term, according to estimates from the Tax Foundation.\n\nChinese response\n\nA spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce said Tuesday the country was “strongly dissatisfied” and “firmly opposed” the additional tariff.\n\n“(China) will take countermeasures to firmly safeguard its own rights and interests,” the spokesperson added in a statement.\n\nBefore he became president, Trump pledged a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods, so the tariff level could rise still.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said at the press conference about tariffs on Canada and Mexico that global companies can avoid tariffs if they invest into production in the United States, like TSMC, the Taiwanese chipmaker at the White House on Monday to announce a $100 billion US investment.\n\nTrump’s tariffs will raise prices of imported goods, which could boost demand for goods produced in the US, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs. But they also noted that tariffs will have negative effects on some American businesses.\n\n“Tariff increases will also raise production costs for some domestic producers and will likely prompt foreign retaliation against some US exports, both of which could hurt domestic production,” they wrote in a note.\n\nUS stocks are “likely to be volatile” until Trump’s policies point toward being more growth-focused, said Jason Draho, head of asset allocation for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note Monday.\n\nDraho said he does expect future growth and maintains a “positive medium-term outlook.”\n\n‘Extreme fear’\n\nThe stock market began to slide Monday morning to begin the new month, as investors digested the latest manufacturing survey from the Institute for Supply Management. The survey showed economic activity in the manufacturing industry remained in expansion territory, yet slowed last month. Tariff fears dominated write-in responses to the survey.\n\nMarkets slid Monday afternoon after Trump posted on Truth Social that he plans to implement tariffs on “external product[s],” potentially including agricultural products. Trump’s post referred to his plan for reciprocal tariffs, set to take place on April 2, according to a person familiar, though it was not immediately clear how these tariffs would be implemented.\n\n“To the Great Farmers of the United States: Get ready to start making a lot of agricultural product to be sold INSIDE of the United States. Tariffs will go on external product on April 2nd. Have fun!” Trump said in the post.\n\nThe sentiment driving markets on Monday dipped into “extreme fear” after Trump’s confirmation that tariffs will go into effect on Tuesday, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed Index.\n\nThe stocks dragging markets lower on Monday included Nvidia (NVDA), which fell 8.7%.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury slid to 4.16%, signaling concerns about uncertainty and future economic growth.\n\nBitcoin traded around $85,600 on Monday afternoon, down 8.6% in the past day and largely erasing gains made after Trump on Sunday announced a strategic crypto reserve that would include bitcoin.\n\nMeanwhile, shares in defense companies in Europe soared to record highs on Monday as European leaders consider the need to re-arm amid less US support for Ukraine.",

        "full_text": "Authored by Nick Bryant\n\nWe’ve been bombarded by rumors of the Epstein List, which is thought to be the Holy Grail of the Epstein case. On Wednesday, March 26, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced on national television that the “Epstein files” were on her desk, and she was releasing them to the public the following day. She also declared that the “files” contained “a lot of flight logs” and “a lot of names.”\n\nUnfortunately, Bondi’s declaration was much ado about nothing. So, either she lied on national television, or she didn’t look at the documents on her desk before releasing them. In either case, her behavior was egregious.\n\nI uploaded Epstein’s Black Book to the internet in 2015, and I believe that’s the closest we’ve come to an Epstein List, because the Black Book contains the names of numerous perps. I also uploaded passenger manifests from Epstein’s various sojourns, which, I believe, contain the names of various perpetrators, too. The documentation I released in 2015 had exponentially more information on the particulars of Epstein case than the redacted dreck Bondi released on Thursday.\n\nIn the \"Epstein List\" or \"Epstein Files\" narrative, each acts like Epstein kept a list of his child molesting clients as if were a travel agent at the Jeffrey Epstein Travel Agency. The Epstein list narrative is problematic because the idea he just kept their names and numbers in his black book at best the Epstein list is wishful thinking, at worst it's a contrived meme.\n\nAccording to a New York Times Article from July 8th, 2018, federal authorities seized hundreds, possibly thousands, of sexually suggestive photographs of girls who appear underage as well as hand-labeled compact discs with titles like \"girls pics nude\" and with the namess redacted like \"young [redacted] plus [redacted]\". Judging by the titles on the discs Epstein was a purveyor of child rap material. The latter disc named by the New York Times is perhaps an indication of blackmail.\n\nA New York Times article from August 29th, 2019 names Ghislaine Maxwell, Sarah Kellen Leslie Groff, Adriana Ross Nadia Marcinkova, and Haley Robson as procurers or otherwise pimps for the Epstein criminal enterprise. The case that put Maxwell in prison was truly a travesty of Justice. Two of her indictments consisted of conspiracy to entice miners to travel and engage in illegal sex acts and also conspiracy to transport minors with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity. Though Maxwell was indicted on two conspiracies none of her criminal cohorts were indicted, which makes absolutely no sense.",

        "full_text": "The takeover of the Kennedy Center may seem like an afterthought in the furious drama of President Donald Trump’s first month in office. The abandonment of the transatlantic alliance, proposals to annex territory on multiple continents, the evisceration of national institutions, and overt claims to kingship are such eye-popping departures from precedent that the leadership of a somewhat stuffy, self-consciously elite performing-arts venue seems negligible by comparison. But Trump’s peculiar preoccupation with the Kennedy Center is symptomatic of a profound change in the nature of American power since his inauguration: America is undergoing a cultural revolution. “This is going to be great television,” Trump said at the end of Friday’s stormy session with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. It may as well be the motto of his administration.\n\nIt is a new kind of cultural revolution. Unlike the totalitarian regimes of the 20th century, which imposed ideology on their populaces by means of culture and entertainment, America’s current reality is the overturning of the political order by the country’s entertainers. The American culture industry has overwhelmed politics: Washington today can be understood only as a product of show business, not of law or policy.\n\nThe Trump administration has been consistent in its veneration of show business, if in nothing else. The president has put a WWE executive in charge of education, made a Fox News talking head his secretary of defense, installed a celebrity conspiracy theorist to lead the National Institutes of Health, handed control of Medicare to a TV doctor, and appointed a right-wing podcaster as deputy director of the FBI. Elon Musk is running government reform because he can live-post it. Dr. Phil accompanies ICE on raids. Trump’s Cabinet picks resemble the cast of a reality-television show by design: Trump understands, by instinct and through experience, that the line between entertainment and power in American life has effectively dissolved.\n\nIn his farewell address, President Joe Biden described the incoming administration as an oligarchy. He was mistaken. It is rule by performers: a “histriocracy.” Anyone who wants to understand what is happening in American politics needs to understand it on those terms.\n\nIn 2016, a reality-TV star’s rise to the presidency was novel, and seeing that surprise triumph as an anomaly was still possible. No longer. The 2024 election was not just evidence of a rightward shift among traditionally Democratic voters, or of rising anti-government patriotism, but a clarification of how fundamentally American politics has shifted the ground from which its meaning derives.\n\nPolitics has become an offshoot of spectacle. Trump has left intellectuals grasping for historical analogies: Is he a fascist or a populist? Is he a latter-day Know Nothing or a modern demagogue? The analogies are unsatisfying because they fail to account for popular culture as a political force, the way it has scrambled traditional dividing lines. Trump has Orthodox Jewish grandchildren and is a hero to the white-power movement. He won a record percentage of Arab American votes, then appointed an ambassador to Israel who claims that “there is no such thing as Palestinians.” He enjoys fervent support among evangelicals despite the fact that his character is a living contradiction of every value they revere. These paradoxes would not be possible in a politics that selects the country’s leadership on the basis of ideas and character. They make sense if brute exposure determines who wins.\n\nAs the grand soap opera of this American presidency unfolds, displays of rage and wonder fill every moment: get-rich-quick schemes, rigged games, vengeful punishments. The audience is hurried from one hustle to another. The distinction between a con and a joke has blurred. The great circus showman P. T. Barnum prophesied the rise of Trump when he declared: “Let me furnish the amusements of a nation and there will be need of very few laws.” The connection between Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and John F. Kennedy is more than genetic. Norman Mailer, in his famous essay on the 1960 Democratic Convention, “Superman Comes to the Supermarket,” noticed a mysterious sadness that gripped the spectators, which made sense only when he saw the future President Kennedy in the flesh: “The Democrats were going to nominate a man who, no matter how serious his political dedication might be, was indisputably and willy-nilly going to be seen as a great box-office actor, and the consequences of that were staggering and not at all easy to calculate.” Trump’s Cabinet is the staggering consequence that Mailer could not calculate.\n\nRonald Reagan in the 1980s made the connection between celebrity and power even more explicit; he rose after a career in which perhaps his most famous role was starring opposite a chimpanzee. The “Great Communicator” told corny jokes and knew that television was everything. The Republican Party “won one for the Gipper,” as Reagan’s campaign slogan had it. When his administration abolished the Fairness Doctrine in 1987, releasing news media from any obligation of impartiality, it prepared the way for histriocracy without government interference.\n\nRule by performers is distinct from autocracy. The ruling performers serve the narrative needs of their fans first and foremost. Policy will always be an addendum to the show. The overturning of Roe v. Wade had compelling emotional heft for Trump’s base, a soul-stirring final scene to the movie that had been playing in their minds for generations: “We beat the cosmopolitan elite to save babies.” The happy ending was that abortion became illegal in much of the United States.\n\nBut winning for show is very different from having a desired effect on the world. Since 2018, the rate of abortions has, by most accounts, kept rising—not that anybody seems to care, because the narrative impulse is the primary political driver. In fact, the restrictionist policy’s failure provides an opportunity for endless sequels. Trump has served the pro-life movement’s storyline needs by creating the conditions for an increase in abortion numbers: so many more bad people to punish, so many more babies who need saving. In a politics determined by performance, outcomes are epilogues that nobody reads.\n\nThe reality of rule by performers is profoundly disconcerting to American intellectuals’ self-conception of their government’s dignity. This is the message of the Kennedy Center’s takeover that the D.C. political elite has been so slow to register. If you think it’s a joke to have RFK Jr. in office, that’s the point. Jokes gather attention. Attention creates exposure. Exposure drives power. The greatest asset for any politician today is a bottomless narcissism that requires unremitting attention to satisfy.\n\nRule by performers doesn’t need to impose an autocrat’s lies on the people; people do it to themselves through their entertainments. In 1984, George Orwell described doublethink as the kind of intellectual gymnastics demanded by a totalitarian society: “To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies.” Reality television and the WWE demand similar distortion-effect gymnastics; their audiences willingly suspend their disbelief and gladly accept events they know are artificial as real. The audiences come to political debate already prepared for the blurring of illusion and reality. “The public appears disposed to be amused even when they are conscious of being deceived,” Barnum understood, which is why they called him the “Prince of Humbugs.” In Trump, they have a king.",

        "full_text": "President Trump announced Monday that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. plans to spend $100 billion on new manufacturing plants in Arizona.\n\nTSMC is the world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer. Companies such as Apple and Intel use its chips in computers, smartphones, cars and medical equipment.\n\n“This will create hundreds of billions of dollars in economic activity and boost America’s dominance in artificial intelligence and beyond,” Mr. Trump said. “Semiconductors are the backbone of the 21st-century economy, and really, without the semiconductors, there is no economy.”\n\nThe money will go toward five facilities in Arizona, which Mr. Trump said will create 20,000 to 25,000 jobs.\n\n“The most powerful AI chips in the world will be made right here in America,” he said.\n\nThe president called the move “a matter of economic security, it’s also a matter of national security.”\n\n“We must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here in American factories with American skill and American labor,” he said. “That’s exactly what we’re doing.”\n\nC.C. Wei, the CEO of TSMC, said he was “happy” to announce the $100 billion investment and thanked Mr. Trump for his support.\n\n“It’s going to create thousands of high-paying jobs,” Mr. Wei said.\n\nTSMC chips manufactured in the U.S. will not be subject to tariffs.\n\nMr. Trump said these and other new factories will increase the U.S. manufacturing share to close to 40% of the chips in the global market.\n\nTSMC benefited from President Biden’s CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which promised $6.6 billion in funding. The company spent more than $65 billion to build three facilities in Arizona, and the first started producing 4-nanometer chips late last year.\n\nMr. Trump has threatened up to 100% tariffs on semiconductor chip imports if production isn’t moved to the U.S.\n\nHe has bashed the CHIPS Act for giving money to a company that already had plenty. He has also raised concerns about Taiwan’s dominance in the industry.\n\n“They left us and went to Taiwan,” Mr. Trump told congressional Republicans in January. “And we don’t want to give them billions of dollars like this ridiculous program that Biden has given everybody billions of dollars. They already have billions of dollars. They’ve got nothing but money. … They didn’t need money. They needed an incentive. And the incentive is going to be they’re not going to want to pay a 25, 50 or even a 100% tax.”\n\nCritics of the Taiwan-based company say it has a monopoly on the worldwide microchip market. More than 90% of the most advanced chips come out of the island, which is the target of constant invasion threats by China.\n\nAnalysts see risks to TSMC operating only out of Taiwan, as it has largely done to date.\n\nAttacks on the island leading to destroyed facilities could leave America shorthanded, putting at risk some of the country’s most important technology and affecting the U.S. military. The company has some facilities in mainland China, which could be susceptible to hacking and sabotage.\n\nLawmakers and other officials have suggested that TSMC’s fabrication plants should be destroyed to prevent them from falling into China’s hands if the communist power follows through with its threat to take over Taiwan, which it views as a renegade province.\n\nThe notion was criticized because the absence of production on Taiwan, regardless of political control, would badly damage economies worldwide.\n\nThe TSMC announcement is just one of several investment announcements Mr. Trump has made since he took office.\n\nThe heads of OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank plan to spend up to $500 billion in artificial intelligence infrastructure. DAMAC Properties said it will spend $20 billion to build data centers.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook has announced plans to invest $500 billion in the U.S. and move manufacturing plants from Mexico to the U.S.\n\nHonda announced Monday that it will produce its next-generation Civic hybrid in the U.S. instead of Mexico to avoid any tariffs.",

        "full_text": "In February 2025, claims (archived) circulated on social media and news outlets including Fox News and Newsweek that 70 Christians were beheaded in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nMedia reports and posts (archived) on X (archived), Facebook and Instagram (archived) said the bodies of the victims were found in a church in Kasanga after the victims were kidnapped from Mayeba, both villages in North Kivu province in the country's northeast.\n\nReports from two religious persecution awareness groups claimed attackers beheaded some or all of the bodies.\n\nSeveral reports accused the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in the Democratic Republic of Congo, also known as the Allied Democratic Forces, of carrying out the attack. The ADF is an armed group designated by the United States as a terrorist organization.\n\nSome Snopes readers asked whether the reported killings happened in Congo without specifying which of the two nations bearing this name — the Republic of Congo, formerly a French territory, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly a Belgian territory — they were referring to. The two are separate countries bordering the Congo River.\n\nThough the story that 70 Christians were beheaded in the DRC was widely reported in local media, it was not possible to independently verify the claims.\n\nLocal media reports featured varying dates for the kidnapping and killing of the alleged victims. Though some stories featured named sources, it was difficult to adequately back up the sources' credentials. Open Doors UK, a charity raising awareness of the prosecution of Christians, told Snopes it was \"100% confident\" that the reported attack occurred. Meanwhile, MONUSCO, the United Nations peacekeeping mission in the DRC, said in a Feb. 24 statement that the reports \"remain unverified.\" The International Committee of the Red Cross in the DRC declined to confirm or deny the claims.\n\nIn a statement, MONUSCO said (emphasis ours):\n\nMONUSCO acknowledges the serious allegations received from a civil society source regarding the reported discovery of over 70 bodies, including those of women, children, and elderly individuals, found on 15 February in a church building in Maiba village, Lubero Territory, North Kivu. According to these initial claims, the victims were allegedly tied up and decapitated, possibly killed with bladed weapons by unidentified armed elements men.\n\nAt this stage, however, it is important to clarify that these reports remain unverified. Our colleagues from the Joint Human Rights Office (JHRO), in coordination with the MONUSCO field office in Beni, are actively investigating the allegations. In line with our established methodology, these claims can only be substantiated once they are corroborated by at least two independent sources.\n\nFor a story to be substantiated it must be corroborated by at least two independent sources, MONUSCO said.\n\nHowever, MONUSCO did confirm that \"at least 40 civilians\" were abducted by \"elements of the Allied Democratic Forces\" from Mayeba, the same village named in the beheading reports, on Feb. 10.\n\nLocal media reports used hard-to-verify sources\n\nLocal media sources widely reported the story, including Radio Okapi, a MONUSCO-supported outlet, that reported that the 70 bodies were discovered on Feb. 15. However, a report from news site 7sur7 citing a phone interview with Vianney Vitswamba, the head of the local \"community protection committee,\" said the bodies were discovered on Feb. 14.\n\nAnother news site, Actualite.cd, reported the alleged victims were abducted on Feb. 11-12, also citing Vitswamba. Afrik.com, a news site reporting on African affairs in French, cited Vitswamba for the Feb. 11-12 abductions but reported, without an attribution, that the bodies were discovered on Feb. 14.\n\nA Google search for Vitswamba's name from Jan. 1, 2000, until Feb. 10, 2025, brought up two articles from 7sur7 about another alleged ADF attack in Lubero in January 2025. This is the same territory as the reported February 2025 attack. The 7sur7 articles also cited Vitswamba. There were no results for Vitswamba's name in news reporting prior to 2025, and it was not possible to find credible contact details for him.\n\nAnonymous sources formed backbone of charity reports\n\nSeveral religious charities also reported on the incident. Open Doors UK, a charity raising awareness of the persecution of Christians worldwide, cited Muhindo Musunzi, the director of a local primary school, who said the \"chaotic security situation\" in the area had caused schools and other public institutions to cease operations. A Google search of Musunzi's name did not bring up credible results prior to the February 2025 story.\n\nBen Cohen, spokesman for Open Doors UK, told Snopes via email that the organization was \"100% confident\" that the incident occurred. According to Cohen, the group's Africa team spoke to Musunzi about the attack and contacted local church leaders as well.\n\n\"We are gathering more information all the time and expect to have a list of the names of those killed. However we have cross checked and can confirm they were all members of local churches. It is a largely Christian area,\" Cohen said.\n\nBoth Open Doors UK and Aid to the Church in Need, a Catholic organization supporting persecuted Christians, cited unnamed sources in their reports.\n\nAid to the Church in Need cited an anonymous source who said the 70 bodies were discovered on Feb. 15. The source was unnamed for their safety, ACN said. Snopes does not rely on anonymous sources to confirm claims. We have reached out them for more information and await their reply.\n\nThere were no reports at the time of this writing that ISIS or the ADF had claimed responsibility for the attack.",

Kim Reynolds, trans people in Iowa will no longer be considered a protected category under state law.\n\nThe bill’s supporters were clear: They want to be able to discriminate against trans people — and don’t want any barriers like pesky civil rights protections in the way.\n\n“If signed, Iowa will become the first state in American history to remove a protected class from its Civil Rights Act,” wrote Erin Reed, a journalist and trans rights advocate, “setting a dangerous precedent for broader rollbacks of anti-discrimination protections.”\n\nIntroduced last week, the new legislation was pushed through at breakneck speed. The Republican-led Iowa Legislature voted 60 to 36 in the House and 33 to 15 in the Senate to pass the bill, which now heads to Reynolds’s desk for signing. Reynolds has been a keen participant in the Republicans’ anti-trans onslaught so is unlikely to push back.\n\nIowa included gender identity in its civil rights code since 2007 with the aim of protecting against employment, housing, health care, education, and other widespread discrimination that trans people face.\n\nA 2024 study from the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law found that 82 percent of trans people reported experiencing discrimination or harassment at work due to their gender identity or sexual orientation — nearly double the number of cis LGBTQ+ individuals who reported experiencing discrimination. One in 5 trans people have experienced homelessness at some point in their lives.\n\nThe move to revoke civil rights — and remove “gender identity” as a protected category — is directly at odds with the Supreme Court’s 2020 decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, which held that the 1964 Civil Rights Act protects employees against discrimination based on sex and gender identity. In line with the Trump administration’s anti-scientific enforcement of two strictly binary sexes, the Iowa bill defines sex as assigned by anatomy at birth.\n\nThe Republicans behind the law were unambiguous that civil rights protections were a barrier to enforcing other anti-trans laws on their traditionalist, pro-natalist agenda. It is harder to ban people from bathrooms, from educational spaces, from the public and professional sphere, when those people are understood to have rights.\n\n“All of these common-sense policies are at risk so long as gender identity remains in the Iowa civil rights code,” state Rep. Steven Holt, a Republican supporter of the bill, said on the House floor.\n\nHolt was, of course, referring to the sort of policies that have led to the harassment of both trans and cis people in women’s bathrooms. Such measures have opened the door to proposed genital inspections for children who want to play sports, not to mention the denial of potential lifesaving health care — all in the name of a “common-sense” gender fascism that, for all its alleged naturalness, takes an extraordinary amount of effort and violence to enforce.\n\nIt should not need repeating that trans women have never been found to pose a higher risk of perpetrating an assault in a women’s bathroom than cis women; there is no correlation between trans-inclusive policies and a rise in safety risks. Rather it is trans people, particularly trans people of color, who are at significantly elevated risks of violence, including deadly violence.\n\nI only restate this here because much mainstream coverage of anti-trans attacks like the Iowa legislation — including in the New York Times — depicts these discriminatory assaults as if they represent a debate with two reasonable opposing sides, without clarifying the truth: Republican claims to women’s safety concerns are based on a phantasma of threat, and part of a broader drive to erase bodily autonomy.",

        "full_text": "The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) upcoming Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee meeting on March 13 was abruptly canceled via email on Wednesday. The committee was to consider the selection of strains to be included in the influenza virus vaccines for the 2025–2026 flu season. This is the second vaccine-related advisory meeting canceled since Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. took over at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\nNo reason for the cancellation was given, and the committee members were warned against forwarding the email. It suggested that members decline to answer questions from media.\n\nSo much for Kennedy's pledge earlier this month of \"radical transparency.\" He added, \"We will make our data and our policy process so transparent that people won't even have to file a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request.\"\n\nIn addition to suggesting members of the FDA's vaccine committee stifle themselves, the HHS will publish a notice next week in the Federal Register to eliminate public comment on that agency's plans and decisions. While past meetings have been open to public scrutiny and participation, it is not clear if the new limits will apply to future meetings of the committee. Radical transparency, indeed.\n\nWith respect to the normal processes for evaluating and developing annual flu vaccines, the FDA has previously explained:\n\nThe job of producing a new vaccine for the next flu season starts well before the current season ends. For the FDA, it's a year-round initiative.\n\nFlu viruses are constantly evolving. The flu viruses that circulate and cause disease in people often change from one year to another, necessitating a new vaccine every year.\n\nTo accomplish this, the FDA, World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other partners collaborate by collecting and reviewing data on the circulating flu strains from around the world to identify those likely to cause the most illness in the upcoming season.\n\nIn late February/early March — well before the new influenza season begins, the FDA convenes its vaccines advisory committee to review data about which flu viruses have caused disease in the past year, how the viruses are changing, and disease trends so they can recommend the flu virus strains to include in the vaccines for the upcoming U.S. flu season.\n\nOnce the strains are selected, vaccine manufacturers begin the manufacturing process to include the newly selected flu strains in their FDA-approved vaccines. The different virus strains are combined to formulate the vaccine into standard dosages. The vaccine is then filled into vials, syringes and, for the nasal vaccine, sprayers.\n\nFlu vaccine effectiveness varies from year to year depending, among other things, on whether the FDA guessed right about which strains will be circulating each season. The current vaccine is around 40 percent to 60 percent effective against influenza-associated hospitalization.\n\nNoting that the U.S. is currently experiencing one of the worst flu seasons in a decade, Infectious Diseases Society of America president Tina Tan warns that \"cancelling a critically important Food and Drug Administration meeting that is vital to the development of effective flu vaccines for next flu season is irresponsible.\" She adds, \"Cancelling this meeting means vaccine makers may not have the vital information and time they need to produce and distribute targeted vaccines before the next flu season. If the FDA meeting is not immediately rescheduled, many lives that could be saved by vaccination will be lost.\"\n\nRFK, Jr.'s HHS promises that the FDA \"will make public its recommendations to manufacturers in time for updated vaccines to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season.\"\n\nWe'll see.",

Police detained the driver, who appeared to have ploughed intentionally into the crowd given the speed at which he was driving, prosecutors said in an act Interior Minister Nancy Faeser labeled \"horror in broad daylight\". He did not appear to have been politically or religiously motivated, but there were reasons to believe he was psychologically unwell, said Mannheim Chief Public Prosecutor Romeo Schluessler. Prosecutors have initiated investigative proceedings against the suspect, a 40-year-old German man from the neighbouring state of Rhineland-Palatinate, on two counts of murder and multiple counts of attempted murder. The suspect has not been questioned yet as he had to undergo medical treatment after shooting himself in the mouth with a blank-firing gun after the attack. He appeared to be a landscape gardener who lived alone, prosecutors said, adding that they were now investigating his home for clues. Security has been a key concern in Germany following a string of violent attacks in recent weeks, including deadly car rammings in Magdeburg in December and in Munich last month, as well as a stabbing in Mannheim in May 2024. \"The incident — like the terrible acts of the past months — serves as a stark reminder: we must do everything possible to prevent such acts,\" said Germany's likely next leader, Friedrich Merz, whose conservatives won a national election last month. \"Germany must once again become a safe country. We will work with full determination to achieve this.\" Police officers work at the site where a car drove into a crowd, in Mannheim, Germany, March 3, 2025.

REUTERS/Heiko Becker , Messages of solidarity were sent from across Europe. \"To all the people of Mannheim, especially to all the relatives of the victims of the attack, to the German people. France is at your side,\" French President Emmanuel Macron wrote on the social media platform X. Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said \"attempts to destabilize democratic nations will not prevail\". The two who died were an 83-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man. NERVOUS CARNIVAL Police were on high alert for this year's carnival parades after social media accounts linked to the Islamic State militant group called for attacks on the events in Cologne and Nuremberg. There did not appear to be a connection between Monday's incident and the carnival celebrations, the interior minister of the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Thomas Strobl, told reporters. Those festivities culminated on Rose Monday with a number of parades, although not in Mannheim, which held its main event on Sunday. Rose Monday, the culmination of the annual carnival season celebrated in Germany's mainly Catholic western and southern regions, features parades of floats that often include comical or satirical references to current affairs. This year's carnival has included floats featuring U.S. President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin, tech billionaire Elon Musk and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Dressed in traditional jester costumes and sporting colourful makeup, thousands of partygoers danced through the streets of Cologne, Dusseldorf and other cities in western and southern Germany ahead of the fasting season of Lent.

Speaker of the House Mike Johnson speaks during a House Republican members conference meeting in Trump National Doral resort, in Miami, Florida, U.S. January 27, 2025. , Summary Republicans, Democrats at odds over Trump spending cuts Both sides say they want to keep government funded until October WASHINGTON, March 3 (Reuters) - With less than two weeks to go before a March 14 deadline, Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. Congress appear to be nowhere close to a deal to avert a government shutdown that would throw Washington into deeper turmoil. The talks have been complicated by President Donald Trump , who has ignored spending laws passed by Congress, suspended foreign aid and fired tens of thousands of federal workers. Both sides say his actions are the biggest sticking point as they seek to reach a deal that would provide government funding beyond March 14, when it is due to expire. Democrats say they are trying to secure guarantees that would prevent Trump and his budget-slashing point person, billionaire Elon Musk , from firing more workers or cancelling more government programs. \"We will continue to make clear that the law has to be followed,\" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters late last week. Republicans say Democrats are trying to undo Trump's actions, which they call a nonstarter. \"The bigger issue is the Democrats' insistence on putting poison pills into the bill that would restrict the president’s abilities,\" Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine told reporters last week. Collins said she is \"very close\" to an agreement with Democrats that would fund the government at current levels through September 30, the end of the fiscal year. Trump has said on social media that he supports that approach. Democratic Senator Patty Murray of Washington said that would give Trump more power to shift funding as he pleases and would create shortfalls for some safety net programs. Both she and Collins have said a flat-line extension would also pose problems for the U.S. military at a time when the United States is confronting challenges from Russia, China and other parts of the world. The spending deal only covers a portion of the budget, funding agencies like the Department of Defense and the Environmental Protection Agency. It would not address the country's rising borrowing costs or rapidly growing benefit programs like Social Security and Medicare. Republicans are separately pushing to extend the tax cuts that Trump signed into law in 2017. One version, which narrowly passed the House last week, would cut taxes by $4.5 trillion and reduce spending by $2 trillion over a decade. Independent analysts say that would further add to the nation's $36 trillion debt load. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson said in a Sunday interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that he was aiming to pass a stopgap funding bill. \"We are working hard to do our responsibility to keep the government open,\" said Johnson, of Louisiana. \"We need our Democrat colleagues to come to the table and be reasonable about that.\" Johnson leads a slim 218-215 majority and last year had to repeatedly turn to Democrats to pass legislation through his chamber, where a simple majority suffices. Democratic votes are needed to pass most bills in the Senate, where Republicans currently hold a 53-47 majority, short of the 60-vote threshold for most legislation. Trump's administration has made clear that its budget cutting efforts will continue. Officials last week ordered federal agencies to lay the groundwork for further layoffs, beyond the 100,000 who have already been fired or offered a buyout. The government employed 2.3 million civilian workers last year. Failure to reach a spending deal by March 14 would force the government to furlough hundreds of thousands of workers and shutter \"nonessential\" operations , such as financial regulation and trash pickup at national parks. The last government shutdown was also the longest, ending in January 2019 after 35 days, as Trump during his first term in office and lawmakers clashed over his effort to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. With no clear resolution in sight, lawmakers have already begun pointing fingers. \"Republicans have a responsibility to fund the government,\" Jeffries said last week, pointing out that Republicans control both chambers of Congress and the White House. Representative John Rutherford, a Florida Republican, said if Democrats vote against the \"clean\" extension of spending through September, \"they're the ones voting for the shutdown, not us.\" Reporting by Richard Cowan and David Morgan, additional reporting by Katharine Jackson; editing by Andy Sullivan and Chizu Nomiyama . , United States category Combative Trump declares 'America is back'.

        "full_text": "If you think your energy bill is already high, brace yourself. Labour may have promised a Net Zero electricity system that would cut average bills by £300 — but as new research reveals, the opposite is going to happen. We can expect the cost of electricity to increase by at least 75%.\n\n“I have absolute faith,” energy secretary Ed Miliband has said, that Net Zero will “do great things for our country and our world.” Inconveniently, an investigation by one of Britain’s leading energy experts provides evidence that our growing reliance on Miliband’s beloved renewable forms of energy, not the “rollercoaster” fossil fuels market, is more likely to have a devastating economic effect.\n\nFor the past two months, Professor Gordon Hughes, a senior fellow at Washington’s National Centre for Energy Analytics and Edinburgh University’s former head of economics, has been working with UnHerd to develop a sophisticated computer model of the UK’s electricity system which provides a robust picture of power generation and why the economic pain is only set to continue.\n\nMiliband, according to Hughes, is starting from a false premise. He is “unambiguously wrong” to claim that the principal cause of rising bills to date has been the price of natural gas. In fact, the wholesale price of electricity, which is where changes in fossil fuel prices are most clearly seen, has generally been constant for the past 20 years. And yet in that same period, electricity bills paid by businesses have almost quadrupled, while those of domestic households have more or less trebled.\n\nIt’s true that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 saw the European natural gas price surge briefly by up to 500%, while there was a smaller, short-lived spike in 2008, caused by an imbalance between supply and demand. But to blame, as Miliband does,“petrostates and dictators” for the fluctuations is, according to Hughes, just a “convenient scapegoat”. In fact, it’s the ever-growing thicket of taxes, levies and subsidies, stemming from the switch to renewables, which has caused the price increase, for these added extras now comprise more than three-quarters of the cost of electricity on household bills. According to Hughes, “the steady increase in inflation-adjusted electricity prices over the last two decades is largely a matter of self-inflicted harm”.\n\nAnd his model reveals that under the Government’s 2030 clean power plan, much worse is yet to come.\n\nFor true believers like Miliband, this would be a price worth paying if Britain really could become a net-zero paradise. But unfortunately, given the basic inefficiency of renewables, and the fact they often don’t generate power for hours or days at a time, fossil fuels are destined to remain part of our energy mix for many years. This means that if we want to keep the lights on, we are going to have to spend billions of pounds well before 2030 to build new, back-up gas-fired power plants that Miliband claims will only be used 5% of the time, simply because so many in our existing fleet are worn out.\n\nThe single biggest element in the coming increase projected by the model is the cost of the planned expansion in renewables. Official estimates of its cost, says Hughes, are too low, and judging by recent market data, the price for constructing new wind and solar farms is likely to be around £150 billion over the next five years — all of which will be added to bills.\n\nAnother factor is Britain’s increasing dependence on electricity supplied via undersea cables from abroad. According to the Hughes model, the more electricity we import, the more we pay. But without it, there will be blackouts. In 2024, after all, Britain was a net electricity importer 91% of the time. Yet foreign energy cannot be relied on. Norway has already passed a law allowing its government to block the sale of electricity when its own supply is scarce. Other countries may well follow suit.\n\nYou might argue that high prices from European supplies are, in turn, caused by spikes in the natural gas market. But that, Hughes’s model shows, would once again be false: gas accounts for less than 15% of Germany’s energy mix, and less than 5% of France’s. And while Miliband claims his Net Zero plans are needed because gas prices are always bound to rise, that’s also untrue. In Europe, the long-term trend has been stable for 25 years, while in America, the fracking boom has seen costs fall. In other words, to insure against another 2022 — an unusually bad year — Miliband wants to transform British energy in ways that Hughes’s model shows will incur much long-term hardship. That, he notes, “seems like rather a bad bargain”.\n\n“While Miliband claims his Net Zero plans are needed because gas prices are always bound to rise, that’s untrue.”\n\nWorse is to come, especially once Labour’s green revolution really kicks in. It’s certainly true that wind and solar farms can generate energy from nature, saving operators on fuel costs. But the “full system costs” of renewables wipe out these gains. If, for example, the wind doesn’t blow, turbines will need backup generators. And though Miliband says he wants an eightfold increase in large-scale batteries to store electricity when the weather doesn’t cooperate, the technology only functions for around two hours. This winter, we’ve had days on end without wind, and Hughes’s model suggests batteries would make up just 10-15% of the shortfall.\n\nHow, then, would Britain secure the rest of the energy it needs? With natural gas! While Miliband claims gas-powered plants will only need to operate 5% of the time by 2030, Hughes suggests the real figure will be at least three times as high — bearing in mind that the Government says growth in electric vehicles, heat pumps and immigration will increase demand for electricity by 11%. To create a reserve big enough to cope when renewables aren’t functioning and parts of the system “trip off” because of a fault, Hughes says that by 2030, Britain will need some 50 gigawatts (GW) of gas or diesel generating capacity, up from 30 GW now, partly because nuclear stations are due to shut, and we cannot rely on electricity always being available from abroad.\n\nOf course, existing gas plants could remain operational, but only run when needed. But this would ignore another problem. The “open cycle” variety of gas-powered turbines that can be fired up quickly, making them suitable for occasional use, have a lifespan of around 30 years — and almost all in Britain have already reached this limit. By 2030, two-thirds of the less adaptable “closed cycle” type will be similarly aged. Even if we make generous assumptions about how many old facilities might still be available, this means building a whole new fleet over just five years, even though these plants would often lie idle.\n\nAll this will obviously cost billions. Current turbine prices come in at some £60 million per GW, so building new back-up plants with a total capacity of 30 GW would cost £18 billion, and 50 GW £30 billion. This implies a further question. With the economy in the doldrums, and the Treasury under pressure to fund budget increases in health and defence, how exactly would Miliband pay for his net-zero dreams? Here, again, the answer is levies on bills, the fees that have already raided pockets so dramatically. Contracts for backup power plants are issued by the Government through what it calls the “capacity market”. This is already skyrocketing, from £120 million in 2017 to £1.1 billion in 2024. With renewables continuing to crowd out reliable alternatives, the capacity market is increasingly needed. And Hughes’s model says these levies are likely to reach an eyewatering £7.4 billion by 2030 — a conservative estimate.\n\nThe model identifies still further costs. One is the permits operators must buy to burn gas and other fossil fuels, and whose prices are constantly rising. Then there’s the so-called “balancing mechanism” — whereby operators are paid to generate energy in an emergency, or else cut off production entirely in the case of grid bottlenecks. Taking in all these factors, Hughes’s model suggests the cost of electricity production could reach almost £60 billion by 2030, between 70 and 80% higher than it would be if the UK stuck with its current, non-Net Zero system.\n\nNor is this even the whole story. All told, electricity generation only accounts for about half your bill. Most of the rest is formed of “network charges” — paid to the National Grid and energy firms for ensuring the power gets from producers to end users. The exact numbers are more difficult to calculate. But the National Electricity System Operator (NESO), the Government-owned company that runs the grid, has said that to create a Net Zero system, it will need to vastly expand its network to link up new wind and solar farms. The upshot? A potential outlay of £65 billion by 2030, with network charges rising from between 80 and 117%.\n\nThe economic impact of all this, it hardly needs stating, would be disastrous. “It is a tax on all of us,” is how Hughes puts it. “Electricity-intensive industries which compete in world markets can only meet it by reducing wages or profits. Since workers are unwilling to accept reductions in their incomes, the result has been that they have closed their activities in the UK and moved elsewhere.” The evidence is already in, with the recent demise of the Bridgend steelworks, the pending closure of the Grangemouth refinery and the likely end of car manufacturing at the BMW factory in Oxford. Vauxhall, Hotpoint, JCB and niche manufacturers of items such as mattresses are also cutting jobs and have warned they may soon leave Britain too.\n\nNot that Ed Miliband seems to mind. Only last week, he reiterated his commitment to Labour’s net-zero targets, stating that “the single most important thing we can do is stick to our clean power mission”. It seems that to a man seeking to build a world-leading utopia, something as transient as Britain’s future prosperity doesn’t mean very much.\n\n***",

        "full_text": "There is the theory that President Trump is still bitter about his Canadian hotel ventures that went bust.\n\nSome, on social media, have speculated that a 2019 photograph in which Justin Trudeau appeared poised to kiss Melania Trump, the first lady, at a Group of 7 gathering in France, left Mr. Trump with a grudge against the dashing Canadian prime minister.\n\nAnd then there is the transactional view, that Mr. Trump sees the acquisition of Canada as the 51st state as the ultimate real estate deal that would seal his presidential legacy.\n\nAs Mr. Trump prepares to push ahead with a new round of tariffs on the United States’ neighbors to the north and south, he has expressed a special brand of loathing for Canada. The bullying of a country whose most prominent stereotype is that its people are “nice” has led to political upheaval in Canada and created both consternation and speculation about why Mr. Trump wants to engage in a trade war with one of America’s biggest trading partners.\n\n“I can’t quite figure it out,” said Stephen Moore, the Heritage Foundation economist and former adviser to Mr. Trump. “Whether it’s some kind of strategic leverage, I don’t know.”\n\nNoting that there is “no love lost” between the president and Mr. Trudeau, Mr. Moore added: “With Trump, politics is personal.”\n\nMr. Trump has threatened to hit Mexico and Canada with 25 percent tariffs on all imports on Tuesday unless the countries do more to prevent migrants and drugs from flowing into the United States. On Saturday, the president picked another trade fight with Canada, this time over lumber.\n\nIntrigue abounds in Canada about why Mr. Trump has repeatedly belittled a neighbor and threatened to destabilize its economy with tariffs, a process that has brought relations between the two countries to a low point not seen in decades.\n\nIn contrast to the close and supportive relationship that Mr. Trudeau, who is entering his final week in office, enjoyed with another U.S. president, Barack Obama, his relationship with Mr. Trump has been fractious.\n\nWhile Mr. Trudeau was generally circumspect in his public remarks about Mr. Trump during the president’s first administration, the two men have dramatically different personal and political styles. Mr. Trump bombastically denigrates people he perceives as opponents, whereas Mr. Trudeau often speaks about the value of bringing people together, what he once called a “sunny ways” approach to political life.\n\nIn candid remarks to a group of business leaders last month that was captured by a microphone, Mr. Trudeau offered a theory for Mr. Trump’s Canada obsession that is widely shared in the country.\n\n“Not only does the Trump administration know how many critical minerals we have, but that may be even why they keep talking about absorbing us and making us the 51st state,” Mr. Trudeau told the gathering in Toronto.\n\n“They’re very aware of our resources,” Mr. Trudeau said, “of what we have, and they very much want to be able to benefit from those.”\n\nHe added: “But Mr. Trump has it in mind that one of the easiest ways of doing that is absorbing our country. And it is a real thing.”\n\nMr. Trump does have a particular affinity for minerals. He has been pushing to broker a deal to secure access to Ukraine’s supply of rare earths as he seeks to broker an agreement to end its war with Russia.\n\nAs a businessman, Mr. Trump had two dealings with Canada that, while relatively limited, were both failures. The Toronto hotel and condominium project, owned by a Toronto investor who licensed the Trump name and hired a Trump company to manage it, went into receivership in 2016. The following year, a hotel owned by Malaysian investors bearing the Trump name, again under license and with a similar management contract, opened in Vancouver, British Columbia. (Promotional material exaggerated the building’s height.) It failed, as well.\n\n“Trump’s name and brand have no more place on Vancouver’s skyline than his ignorant ideas have in the modern world,” Mr. Robertson wrote.\n\nBefore delving into politics, Mr. Trump expressed little ill will toward Canada.\n\nIn 2012, when the Obama administration was delaying a decision on approving the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would have transported oil from Canada to the United States, Mr. Trump declared on social media that the project must move forward.\n\n“We need to use our resources and support allies like Canada,” Mr. Trump said.\n\nBut by 2015, his perceived failings of the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico became a central issue of Mr. Trump’s first presidential campaign. Mr. Trump routinely called the deal a “disaster” for American workers, and prioritized scrapping the pact as a first order of business if he won the election.\n\nAn agreement to overhaul the trade deal was signed in 2020 after fraught negotiations between the three countries that often grew contentious. At one point, Mr. Trump suggested leaving Canada on the sidelines and proceeding with a deal between the United States and Mexico.\n\nNow back in office, Mr. Trump has made clear that the agreement he signed did not do enough for the United States and must be rewritten. In recent days he has lashed out at Chrystia Freeland, the Canadian official who negotiated it on behalf of Canada.\n\n“She’s a whack,” Mr. Trump said of Ms. Freeland, who was Canada’s deputy prime minister and finance minister during the president’s first term, in an interview with The Spectator.\n\nAs Mr. Trump has wielded the threat of new tariffs on Canada over the last month, his tone toward the departing prime minister has been even more derisive. He has nicknamed Mr. Trudeau “governor” amid persistent suggestions that the United States might annex Canada.\n\nMr. Trump even called for the former Canadian hockey player Wayne Gretzky to run for prime minister, suggesting late last year that he would “win easily.” Mr. Gretzky, who does not support Canada’s joining the United States, has faced backlash at home from citizens who view him as a traitor because of his association with Mr. Trump.\n\nThe insults have led to a boom in nationalism in Canada, including “Made in Canada” Facebook groups. In one group, which has more than a million members, Canadians compared notes on pancake mixes that are made in Canada and offered recommendations on flavors of Cove Soda, a potential alternative to Coca-Cola.",

        "full_text": "Ukraine is ready to sign the minerals deal with Washington, despite the heated argument between him and his US counterpart on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters late Sunday.\n\nMere days after leaving the White House without signing the deal with US President Donald Trump, Zelenskyy said, \"I just want the Ukrainian position to be heard. We want our partners to remember who the aggressor is in this war.\"\n\nThe meeting turned into a terse exchange of words live on TV, with Trump concluding the raw minerals deal — which brought Zelenskyy to the White House to begin with — was off.\n\n\"I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations,\" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform Friday.\n\n\"I don’t want advantage, I want peace. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for peace,\" he announced.\n\nUS access to Ukraine's rare earth minerals was first presented to Zelenskyy by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent earlier in February.\n\nWashington is asking for a 50% cut of all revenues generated from Ukraine's mineral and natural resources in what US officials have said is payment for previous military support.\n\nAccording to the deal, Ukraine will contribute the proceeds to a fund, which will then be invested to \"promote the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine.\"\n\nZelenskyy has said that the deal must include real security guarantees for Ukraine and warned against further Russian aggression if these were not put into place.\n\nHis comments about the deal came at the end of a two-day summit in the United Kingdom, where UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the UK and France would gather a \"coalition of the willing\" that would draw up a peace plan for Ukraine.\n\n“We are at a crossroads in history today,” Starmer said.\n\n“This is not a moment for more talk. It’s time to act. Time to step up and lead and to unite around a new plan for a just and enduring peace.”\n\nPrior to this, Bessent told CBS News that the Ukrainian leader had \"thrown off the sequencing\" of how the minerals and peace deal were supposed to play out, insisting the discussions should have taken place in private.\n\nIt was \"impossible to have an economic deal without a peace deal,\" Bessent said.",

        "full_text": "When President Trump threatened tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China in January, saying those countries needed to do more to stop the flow of drugs and migrants into the United States, Canadian and Mexican officials raced to Washington, bearing charts and videos detailing their efforts to toughen their borders.\n\nCanada created a “fentanyl czar” and committed fresh resources to combating organized crime, while Mexico dispatched troops to the border and delivered cartel operatives into U.S. custody. As a result, Mr. Trump paused tariffs on America’s North American neighbors for 30 days.\n\nChina never made these kinds of overtures and, in Mr. Trump’s view, did not take any big moves to stop the flow of fentanyl into the United States. So on Feb. 4, Mr. Trump moved forward with imposing a 10 percent tariff on all Chinese imports. Last week, the president said that on March 4 he would add another 10 percent on top of all existing Chinese tariffs.\n\nMr. Trump is moving quickly to transform the U.S.-China trade relationship. The Chinese are moving much more cautiously and deliberately as they try to assess Mr. Trump and determine what it is he actually wants from China. Some of Mr. Trump’s advisers, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have held calls with their Chinese counterparts. But a call between Mr. Trump and Xi Jinping, China’s leader, has failed to materialize.\n\nThe situation underscores the quandary for foreign leaders in dealing with a president as unpredictable and unconventional as Mr. Trump, who is making substantial changes to trade terms with little advance notice or preparation.\n\nThe Chinese do not want to initiate a conversation because they do not want to be seen as pleading, and are wary of offering concessions before they understand the parameters of the debate, people familiar with the discussions said. Instead, Chinese officials, academics and others close to the government have been holding discreet conversations to try to determine Mr. Trump’s motives, while floating various aspects of a potential trade deal between the countries to assess the Americans’ reaction.\n\n“With my experience with the Chinese, they are suspicious in the initial rounds of a negotiation that there are hidden traps or other reasons to be cautious,” said Michael Pillsbury, a China expert who advises the Trump administration on dealing with the country.\n\nThe Chinese side has conveyed they would like to work with the United States on mutually beneficial measures. But they have been struggling to identify people in the United States that they see as reliable channels for communication, according to a person close to the Chinese government.\n\nThey are also trying to assess the significance of some recent steps by the administration, like a memorandum that proposed strict limits on investment between the countries. Mr. Trump publicly contradicted that memo days after he signed it, saying he welcomed Chinese investment.\n\n“I think the Chinese are in a wait and listen mode,” said Myron Brilliant, who has spent years working with businesses to understand the Chinese and recently returned from a trip to China. “They’re taking in all kinds of input, they’re beginning their consultations, they’re not pushing the panic button just yet.”\n\n“There is a willingness, an appetite to do a deal with the Trump administration, but China doesn’t want preconditions on that, and seeks more clarity on the parameters of a deal,” said Mr. Brilliant, a senior counselor at DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group, an advisory firm.\n\nThey called for treating China as an equal partner and criticized past measures taken by the Biden administration to “contain” China, like export controls. The delegation also threatened that, if further U.S. tariffs went into effect, China could withdraw a law enforcement package that it had put together to combat the fentanyl trade, which included information that could be used to prosecute Chinese companies, one of the people said. They acknowledged that the Chinese economy was struggling and that more tariffs could hurt it.\n\nCurrent and former advisers and others familiar with Mr. Trump’s thinking say he has expressed interest in striking a wide-ranging deal with Mr. Xi, which could involve Chinese purchases and investment, as well as cooperation on issues like nuclear security.\n\nBut Mr. Trump also believes that China reneged on the deal he signed with it in 2020 by not purchasing enough products. Mr. Trump also has no aversion to ramping up the pressure on Beijing by imposing tariffs, seeing them as a source of leverage in negotiations.\n\nMr. Trump has said he has a great relationship with Mr. Xi and would like the Chinese to invest in the United States. When asked in February if he would do a trade deal with China, Mr. Trump responded, “It’s possible.”\n\nIn an interview on Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures, Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, said that instead of stopping the manufacturing of fentanyl, the Chinese were giving “the maximum subsidy” to people making the ingredients.\n\n“The Chinese need to stop this murder of Americans,” he said.\n\nThe tariffs that Mr. Trump has threatened to impose on China since coming into office are already roughly comparable to those he imposed during his first administration, said Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. In 2018, Mr. Trump put tariffs ranging from 7.5 to 25 percent on more than $350 billion of Chinese imports, levies that remain in effect.\n\n“It’s still early days,” Mr. Kennedy said. “This should be seen as the floor of what’s imposed, not the ceiling.”\n\nBeijing has so far been cautious in retaliating, answering Mr. Trump’s first volley of tariffs with a more limited number of its own. But it has signaled that it is willing to go further, possibly using its dominance in the global supply chain to exact pain.\n\nThe Chinese delegation that included Mr. Cui had come to New York as China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, visited the United Nations. While Mr. Wang did not continue on to Washington, according to one source, the Chinese embassy helped to arrange meetings for Mr. Cui in the nation’s capital.\n\nSenior Communist Party officials including Fang Xinghai, the former deputy chief of China’s markets regulator, and the economist Zhu Min, also traveled to Washington and met with some members of the think tank community and government.\n\nThe Chinese appear to be exploring the best points of contact for their government. In the previous Trump administration, the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, served as an important go-between, as did private sector figures. Recently, the Chinese have been probing the role that Elon Musk — who has extensive business interests in China through Tesla — will play in the Trump administration.\n\nPrivately, the Chinese have indicated a willingness to start negotiating a deal but want to know that they have direct access to Mr. Trump.\n\n“There seems to be a sense that Beijing is blaming what has happened on the poor communication channels,” said Yun Sun, the director of the China program at the Stimson Center, a research group in Washington.",

        "full_text": "watch now\n\nLONDON — The European Union is expected to announce \"concrete\" measures on boosting defense financing this week, sources told CNBC, as Europe and the United States clash over support for Ukraine.\n\nThe 27 EU leaders will gather in Brussels on Thursday for a meeting dedicated to defense and support for Ukraine. It follows two particularly tense moments in U.S.-Europe relations: Vice President JD Vance's speech in Munich in mid-February when he criticized European leaders; and the on-the-record clash between the U.S. administration and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on Friday.\n\nEuropean leaders are trying not to alienate President Donald Trump after he criticized Zelenskyy for \"gambling\" over a potential World War III. At the same time, Europeans know they have to take immediate action to ensure that Ukraine continues to receive the support it needs — and any further aggression from Russian President Vladimir Putin is prevented.\n\n\"There will be intense work in the coming days,\" an EU official, who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the discussions but is part of the preparations for Thursday's meeting, told CNBC Monday.\n\nThe same official said the aim is to announce \"concrete deliverables\" on the financing of defense.\n\nTraders will be watching the talks between EU officials closely. The European Stoxx Aerospace and Defense index has risen almost 23% in the year to date as investors bet on spending hikes, and was over 6% higher in Monday morning trade.\n\nwatch now\n\nTrump has often criticized European nations for failing to spend 2% of their GDP on defense, as stipulated by NATO rules. Since Trump's first term, several countries have increased their defense spending and the latest NATO figures indicate that 23 of the 32 members are expected to have achieved the 2% target in 2024.\n\nNow, many NATO members are looking to increase spending even more, with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte telling CNBC in February that the figure will have to be \"much more than than 2%.\" Trump, meanwhile, has called for 5% of GDP as the NATO contribution target.\n\nHow to spend more on defense\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced in February that EU fiscal rules will be updated to allow countries to spend more on defense without being constrained by specific debt and deficit targets.\n\nThe unnamed EU official told CNBC that the next announcement will go even further. \"We are looking at additional funding for defense at the EU level, including through flexibility in the use of structural funds and adaptation of the EIB mandate,\" the official said.\n\nThe European Investment Bank, which is targeting 95 billion euros ($99.26 billion) in investments in 2025, is currently constrained to only financing dual-use defense projects, which means they have to have both civil and military purposes.\n\nA second EU official, who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the talks, confirmed to CNBC Monday that Von der Leyen is expected to present \"concrete measures\" in terms of defense financing in the coming days. These will then be discussed by EU leaders on Thursday.\n\nRoman Pilipey | Afp | Getty Images\n\n\"We urgently have to rearm Europe. And for that I will present a comprehensive plan to the leaders on how to rearm Europe on 6 March when we have our European Council,\" von der Leyen said at a summit in London on Sunday.\n\nIn a recent report called \"Defending Europe without the U.S.,\" Brussels-based think tank Bruegel calculated that Europe could need \"300,000 more troops and an annual defence spending hike of at least 250 billion euros in the short term to deter Russian aggression.\"\n\nGoldman Sachs, meanwhile, said in a note Sunday that \"in the absence of offsetting fiscal measures, the Euro area needs to fund an additional 0.6% of GDP annually to meet the defence spending target at 2.5%.\"\n\nOne key question is whether the EU will go so far as to agree to common borrowing for defense projects. The bloc decided to take that unprecedented step in 2020 in the wake of the pandemic (known as NextGenerationEU) and some member states believe this should be replicated for defense spending. However, more fiscally conservative nations want to exhaust other options before taking that step.\n\nAccording to Goldman Sachs, EU leaders could \"repurpose\" the outstanding financial capacity from the NextGenerationEU funds for defense. They could then look at a new program, which \"could provide stable funding shielding defence spending from idiosyncratic national factors,\" the analysts added.",

        "full_text": "If there was a silver lining in Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy handing a victory to Vladimir Putin on Friday with the failed minerals deal, it was President Donald Trump effectively luring Putin to the negotiation table through what Putin might see as a more neutral arbiter in Trump.\n\nFriday's Oval Office blowup was \"extremely frustrating\" and a \"missed opportunity for everybody,\" Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., said, because \"Ukraine is still in a precarious position\" before potential talks to end Russia's war on Ukraine.\n\n\"This ultimately, obviously, there needs to be a negotiated settlement,\" Lawler told NPR. \"I think what President Trump is trying to do is get Vladimir Putin to the table for a negotiation.\n\n\"In order to have the strongest possible hand in that negotiation, I think the objective is to have an economic cooperation agreement with Ukraine and the United States, which will strengthen that ability to negotiate.\n\n\"And in order to negotiate a settlement, you need to get both sides to the table. Joe Biden's administration did not engage with Putin for over three years. That obviously complicates the ability to get someone to the table to have an initial discussion.\"\n\nZelenskyy balked at the minerals deal because it did not come with security guarantees, but Lawler noted economic cooperation with Trump's America is de facto security against further Putin aggression.\n\n\"In order for Ukraine to have a very strong hand in the negotiation, the greater the economic cooperation with the U.S. moving forward, the more investment guarantees from the U.S., the easier it will be long term to have security guarantees, and that's important,\" Lawler said.\n\nTrump is playing chess, while Zelenskyy was sticking to his old war-aid talking points he had used during the Biden administration, and Lawler rejected the NPR interviewer's suggestion Trump was scoring an economic prize out of Ukraine.\n\n\"It's not about giving to the U.S.: They're going to need significant economic investment to rebuild when this conflict is over like the rest of Europe during World War II in the aftermath,\" Lawler said.\n\n\"So, having this economic cooperation agreement is critical for the rebuilding efforts moving forward.\n\n\"And by having that level of U.S. investment and engagement, when there is a final agreement, it's going to be a lot harder for Vladimir Putin to renege on it and invade Ukraine again with U.S. investment on the ground.\n\n\"The only winner the other day was Vladimir Putin, that this deal did not happen.\"\n\nBut it just might be the moment that lures Putin to talk a settlement of his war on Ukraine.",

        "full_text": "On a random Tuesday in February, a conservative provocateur and talk radio host made a bold proclamation about the state of the Democratic Party. Donald Trump had won over young men, and nearly a majority of young voters overall in November, because “Democrats, for men, are pussies.”\n\n“There are no masculine men in the Democrat Party right now,” Clay Travis, the Trump-supporting sports and politics commentator, said while speaking on a panel hosted at the University of Chicago. “Who’s the most masculine Democrat right now in America? Mayor Pete?”\n\nHis audience gasped in response. The moderator intervened. And so began a week of debate and commentary about the relationship — or lack thereof — between the Trump-era Democratic Party and the Gen Z men who abandoned them last year.\n\nIn hindsight, all the signs were there that the 2024 election would feature a yawning gender gap between Trump-curious men, and more liberal women. What polls predicted came true: a shift of Gen Z voters toward Republicans, driven by young men voting for Trump. Since then, plenty of postmortems have tried to wrestle with just what went wrong with the Democratic pitch. Still, the question remains: Will this dynamic linger? And if so, how worried should Democrats be?\n\nA month into the second Trump presidency, the alarm bells are still ringing. While the president’s honeymoon is fading, he remains quite popular with the youngest cohort of men.\n\nAs Democrats attempt to redefine themselves ahead of next year’s midterm elections, they’ll need to accurately diagnose why young men have jumped ship in large numbers.\n\nIn reviewing the data and talking to experts, three main explanations emerge.\n\nFirst, there’s the structural: the effects and aftermath of the Covid pandemic and economic pressures that explain the shift of young men to the right.\n\nThen, there are Trump-specific dynamics, related to his persona, his campaign and media strategy last year, and his ability to define himself independently of the two-party, liberal-conservative spectrum.\n\nAnd finally, there are cultural, education, and gender dynamics that explain the divide — which Democrats have driven, and can still fix.\n\nBut if Democrats are to make any progress, their first step must be rooting out denial: When it comes to young men, the party has a real problem.\n\nWhat the Democrats’ young male problem looks like\n\nThe Gen Z gender gap isn’t easy to map out, so it’s helpful to look at a few factors — vote choice, political ideology, partisan identification, and favorability ratings — to try to figure out what’s going on.\n\nThe first, vote choice, is the easiest, but also bluntest, tool to use. Using estimates from AP VoteCast surveys, in 2024, young men backed Trump by a 14-point margin; young women backed Harris by a 17-point margin. Trump’s share of the young male vote increased from 41 percent in 2020 to 56 percent in 2024 per AP VoteCast data by CIRCLE at Tufts University. And it’s young white and Latino men who shifted most dramatically to the right, by 22 points and 38 points respectively.\n\nPartisan identification shows some of this change too. Over the last 20 years, it’s young men who have been more likely to identify as Republicans, according to Gallup polling data. The share of young women, aged 18-29, who identify as or lean toward Democrats has remained steady since about 2003, while the share of young men who identify with Republicans has steadily grown since 2015.\n\nPuzzlingly, the change in partisan leaning has not been accompanied by a corresponding self-reported change in young men’s political ideology. They have not been calling themselves more “conservative” over that same timeline. Instead, it’s young women who have gotten much more liberal over the last two decades, while the share of men who call themselves conservative has remained steady. According to Gallup polling, women 18 to 29 who call themselves liberal are now at the highest level they’ve been since 1999, a trend that picked up during the second Obama term and the first Trump presidency. A plurality of young men, meanwhile, have called themselves moderate over the last 20 years, with shares of young conservatives and young liberals also remaining steady.\n\nWhat this all suggests is two opposite shifts: Young women are identifying as more liberal, but not necessarily more Democratic. Young men, meanwhile, are identifying as more Republican, but not more conservative. It’s a point that Daniel Cox, the director of the American Enterprise Institute’s Survey Center on American Life, was trying to make on the same panel that Travis blew up at the University of Chicago. His argument is that issues, and the positions the political parties are taking, only explain so much.\n\nYoung women are identifying as more liberal, but not necessarily more Democratic. Young men, meanwhile, are identifying as more Republican, but not more conservative.\n\n“You have a slow decline. This didn’t happen in just one election. There’s been a deterioration of Democratic identity among young men for over 10 years,” Cox said. “This group looks a lot more liberal on paper. You had six in 10 young men who are moderates vote for Trump, and more than one in five liberal young men vote for Trump…There’s something about Trump that was attractive and then there’s something about the Democratic Party, at least in its current manifestation, that was repellent.”\n\nExplanation No. 1: It’s bigger than America\n\nThere is no one explanation for these dynamics, but breaking out a few theories can help explain the situation.\n\nWe can start with structural, post-Covid explanations. The shift of young people to the right in general isn’t only happening in the United States, but all over the world. Something about this generation’s experiences, regardless of gender, is causing a rightward shift.\n\nThat shift mirrors the anti-establishment, anti-incumbency trend that democracies have been experiencing since the start of the coronavirus pandemic: frustration with the economic prospects; the squeeze of inflation and prices, and distrust in institutions, which in the US were represented by the Democratic Party. This theory would explain the dramatic shift in vote choices and partisan representation of young men over the last decade, and it is boosted by the fact that both young men and young women swung to Republicans last year — despite those swings being uneven.\n\nOutside of the US, it’s young voters who drove some of the surges of far-right and right-wing political parties across Europe in 2024. As the Atlantic’s Derek Thompson put it recently:\n\nIn France, Germany, Finland, and beyond, young voters are swinging their support toward anti-establishment far-right parties “in numbers equal to and even exceeding older voters.” In Germany, a 2024 survey of 2,000 people showed that young people have adopted a relatively new “gloomy outlook” on the future. No surprise, then, that the far-right Alternative für Deutschland has become the most popular party among Germans under 30. Like most interesting phenomena, this one even has a German name: Rechtsruck, or rightward shift.\n\nThompson points to political science research that has tracked a negative effect on trust in scientific authorities and political leaders as a result of pandemics and epidemics, particularly with those people between the ages of 18 and 25. Declining trust in American institutions — such as the Supreme Court, news media, the presidency, Congress, and big business — all make sense under this view.\n\nThe economics writer Kyla Scanlon argues something similar: that the youngest cohort of Gen Z faces a world of AI-driven disruption and institutional distrust and instability. They’re surrounded by echo chambers that feed their anxiety, and feel looser social connections. In response, they’re embracing more extreme, polarized identities and approaches to the economy and politics.\n\n“Many younger Gen Zers came of age watching political gridlock, rising inequality, and a system that seemed increasingly detached from their lived reality. They saw institutions that refused to adapt (and as of recently, have shown a lack of resilience). They were locked inside during their formative years,” she argues, and so view reality much differently than even the older range of Gen Z.\n\nIn the context of the 2024 election, this theory explains why young Democrats in particular were so down on Joe Biden, and eventually distrustful of Harris and the establishment she came to represent. My own conversations with youth Democratic activists during the election cycle and in its aftermath brought forth many of the same takeaways — that young Democrats found themselves talking to young people who were distrustful of the status quo, of incumbents, and of an older generation of politicians promising change.\n\nBut while these explanations do a solid job explaining the overall shift of Gen Z, they’re less strong on explaining the dramatic lurch right by young men specifically.\n\nExplanation No. 2: There’s something unique about Trump\n\nWhether it was the issues Trump talked about, the salience of those issues to young people, or his campaign strategy and appeal to traditional masculinity, these candidate-specific factors are more persuasive in explaining how a group that reads more liberal on paper could be willing to swing so drastically to the right.\n\nAs Cox of AEI told me, “They’re Trump Republicans, they’re not [traditional] Republicans.” They hold much more progressive views on a range of issues, and are much less aligned with the traditional Republican orthodoxy than standard conservatives, but were Trump-curious, or felt less stigma in being open to voting for him.\n\nMuch of that was due to the media and messaging apparatus Trump and his allies built over the last year, specifically to reach young men. Whether through specific advertising, social media and influencer outreach on YouTube and TikTok, podcast interviews, or other campaign events, Trump saturated the feeds and platforms that young people, especially men, love to consume.\n\nIt worked. Trump posted his strongest gains with groups of young voters who fall into two buckets: those who prioritized the economy and “low-propensity” voters. That second category can be further divided into youth who were least interested or engaged with political news and youth who were voting for the first time.\n\nThese aren’t hardcore conservative, reactionary, or ideological voters. They’re just “not dug in when it comes to politics,” Cox told me. “You look at where young women are on gun control and climate change and reproductive health and LGBTQ rights, and they prioritize these things. Young men are less likely to prioritize any of them. They support some amount of gun control, they’re more pro-choice than pro-life, but it’s not that central to their politics or political identity.”\n\nIn other words, the Trump pitch was persuasive enough to win over a group that might have been destined to break with a Democratic Party that was using the wrong message to try to hold onto their support. But this explanation is unique to Trump and his personal brand and doesn’t necessarily apply to the Republican Party in general or to other Republican politicians.\n\nExplanation No. 3: Democrats are doing something to turn off young men\n\nIf Trump was able to win over young men through his media presence and appeal to masculinity, it suggests Democrats failed to counter that influence — or even did something to make it worse.\n\nCox told me that beyond the specific candidates, there has been a general cultural drift of the Democratic Party’s identity, or perception, among young men that may be a missing piece. Beyond not being “masculine” enough or “too feminine,” there are cultural, class, and educational divides making it harder for the party to hang onto younger men — a party moving left faster than young men are.\n\n“If you look back to George W. Bush and his affect — he went to Yale, he was from an elite pedigree, but he leaned into the blue-collar identity, going out and scrubbing brush and clearing land in his Texas ranch,” Cox said. “This was true then, and it’s more true now, but in an era where people don’t trust slick-talking politicians, the idea of someone using their hands for a living, or pretending to do so, is really resonant. It’s not just a gender gap, but an education divide.”\n\nThis education polarization — of Democrats becoming more of a party of wealthier and better-educated white voters — applies not just to its base, but to its leadership as well. When the messengers, and staffers, running campaigns and formulating the pitches to young voters look less like the people they are trying to reach, “you have just fewer people who are immersed in culturally conversant in ways that can help you craft a winning and effective political message,” he said.\n\nThat cultural shift among Democrats, which includes the party’s embrace of identity politics and progressive social justice-speak, Cox has found, has led to some serious branding problems with young men on a small but influential set of beliefs, specifically affirmative action, LGBTQ, and DEI policies.\n\n“For young white men, their attitudes on various policies related to race are far more conservative than for young white women. There was a really significant divide in perceptions,” Cox said, about privilege and discrimination.\n\nHere, a theory from Vice President JD Vance might actually speak to something that goes beyond ideology or partisanship. Speaking at CPAC last week, Vance argued that “our culture sends a message to young men that you should suppress every masculine urge … don’t allow this broken culture to send you a message that you’re a bad person because you’re a man, because you like to tell a joke, because you like to have a beer with your friends, or because you’re competitive.”\n\nYoung men, especially young white men, over the last 10 years, have grown to feel like underdogs as Democrats and the national culture moved to prioritize marginalized groups or minority communities, the Gen Z writer and strategist Rachel Janfaza explained in the fall. “The left has increasingly focused on uplifting marginalized groups — especially women. But the unintentional consequence of this focus has left young men feeling like no one is speaking to them and that there is no home for them in the Democratic Party.”\n\nStepping into that void are conventional voices like Vance’s or radical ones, like the podcaster Andrew Tate. “Young men are seeing these content creators, podcasters, even politicians, telling them that society is cutting white men out of the picture, or even just all men. And they point to DEI initiatives as this form of wokeness,” Cameron Kasky, a former March for Our Lives gun control and progressive activist, told me. “They say this is an attack on men and white men, and we gotta fight back” by offering alternative models of masculinity that put economic and educational opportunities first.\n\nOn that front, part of the Democratic issue in 2024 might have been that it did not offer an effective alternative “masculinity,” a pro-social, community-focused pitch shared by a credible messenger, instead of mocking young “bros” as “mediocre” or denying that young men feel more isolated.\n\n“Multiple things can be true at once,” Gen Z Democratic strategist Annie Wu Henry told me about this relationship between progressive Democrats and young men last year. “We can acknowledge that white men have historically been the ones given the most privilege and power in society, while also not creating an environment where they feel completely alienated and then turn to spaces like the manosphere online — where they feel seen and accepted — but we also know lead to radicalization and validation of harmful viewpoints of other groups of people.”\n\nDemocrats did not offer an effective alternative “masculinity,” a pro-social, community-focused pitch shared by a credible messenger, instead of mocking young “bros” as “mediocre.”\n\nTo do that, Kasky says, “Democrats need to figure out how to get some swagger back,” and move beyond “Ivy League, fancy” communications.\n\nEven something as small as making a tonal shift will be important. Trump’s favorability among young men, though still higher than with young women, is beginning to trend down, suggesting that last year’s rightward shift might be moderating already.\n\nNone of this has to be permanent\n\nThe fundamental point these theories all make is that none of these attitudes, shifts, or realignments are ironclad — some were specific to the post-pandemic moment, some to the peculiarities of specific candidates, and some to cultural shifts that seem to have stalled. And while voters’ attitudes and perceptions of political parties tend to get ironed out in their youth, this moment of ideological and identitarian tumult might be different.\n\nImportantly for electoral politics and next year’s midterms, the 2024 results suggest that Trump benefited from a youth coalition that isn’t firmly Republican or consistently engaged in politics. The crossover support he received from young moderates and liberals, for example, might not come out to vote in a midterm election, or a non-Trump candidate. And many of their underlying beliefs are still liberal, or progressive on the issues.\n\n“These are not your traditional GOP voters, so whether they come up for a GOP governor or a Senate candidate is very much an open question,” Cox said. “The idea that these voters are not winnable in 2026 and 2028 is crazy. They absolutely are, and I don’t see JD Vance being particularly appealing to them. So the Democratic Party should really think hard about those kinds of voters and the voters that they lost to Trump in 2024.”\n\nBut that Democratic soul-searching will likely create some tensions with other parts of their base and coalitions. Particularly because the most progressive or activist-minded members of the party feel ideologically committed to continue prioritizing minority groups, party leaders may be wary of catering to straight white men. But caring for this demographic will be necessary if they want to reverse Trump’s 2024 gains — and win future elections.",

        "full_text": "Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino.\n\nQuick Take\n\nElon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency have been tasked by President Donald Trump with slashing federal spending. But social media posts falsely claim that as part of that effort, DOGE stopped “royalties” to former President Barack Obama related to the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. The claim came from a satirical website.\n\nFull Story\n\nOn Jan. 20, his first day in office, President Donald Trump established by executive order the new Department of Government Efficiency “to implement the President’s DOGE Agenda,” which has included efforts led by billionaire Elon Musk to reduce government spending and cut the federal payroll.\n\nBut as we’ve written, some of the claims made by DOGE and the Trump administration about overpayments in the Social Security system have been exaggerated, and some claims about spending by the U.S. Agency for International Development have been inaccurate or unsupported.\n\nIn recent days, some social media posts have repeated a fabricated claim that DOGE had halted millions in supposed royalty payments to former President Barack Obama.\n\nA Feb. 27 Threads post falsely claimed, “DOGE stopped an annual payment to Barack Obama for $2.6 million for ‘royalties associated with Obamacare.’ He’s been collecting it since 2010, for a total of $39 million in taxpayer dollars.”\n\nThe posts are referring to the Affordable Care Act, the health care law enacted in 2010 under Obama that became known as Obamacare.\n\nBut the claim that the former president had been receiving royalty payments for the health care law he championed was the invention of America’s Last Line of Defense, or ALLOD, which publishes fabricated political stories and claims on its websites and social media pages that it describes as satirical. ALLOD posted the claim about Obama this month, and the image shared on social media included a stamp labeling the claim as satire.\n\nThe ALLOD website says, “Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined.”\n\nThe other social media posts sharing the claim did not identify the content as satire.\n\nWe could find no evidence that DOGE had stopped any payments to Obama, who as a former president does receive an annual pension payment from the government. Obama has received about $10.5 million from his presidential pension and other government benefits, such as travel and office space, since leaving the White House, The Hill reported. Since he left office at the end of his first term, Trump had received more than $3 million.\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Meta to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

(SAMUEL CORUM/PRESS POOL)\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said President Donald Trump will “meet in the middle” with Mexico and Canada after 25% tariffs on America’s continental neighbors went into effect Tuesday.

        "full_text": "United States immigration officials on Saturday arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian Columbia University graduate who played a leading role in organising the 2024 campus protests at the Ivy League school last year.\n\nAccording to Khalil’s lawyer Amy Greer, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents told her that they would revoke his permanent residency — popularly known as the green card — in the US.\n\nKhalil’s detention and the apparent attempts to deport him represent the most prominent instance of the US government crackdown on student protesters under President Donald Trump, who repeatedly threatened to target universities that are hubs of protests even before his election in November.\n\nSince he was sworn in on January 20, Trump has taken steps to back his plans, including executive orders.\n\nLast week, Trump launched a new tirade, threatening to halt federal funding for schools, colleges, and universities if they allow “illegal protests”.\n\n“Agitators will be imprisoned/or permanently sent back to the country from which they came. American students will be permanently expelled or, depending on the crime, arrested,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n\nOn Friday, the Trump administration pulled $400m in funding from Columbia University, accusing it of failing to combat anti-Semitism.\n\nSo what do we know about Khalil’s arrest, what has Trump done so far, can he compel universities to act against student protesters, and how might higher education institutions respond?\n\nWho are the intended targets?\n\nUS Ambassador-designate to the United Nations Elise Stefanik shared Trump’s remarks last week in a post on X, saying “antisemitism and anti-Israel hate will not be tolerated on American campuses”, confirming that pro-Palestinian protesters and speech critical of Israel are the targets of the president’s threat.\n\nTrump’s announcement comes after he signed a series of executive orders in January targeting alleged anti-Semitism on campuses.\n\nIn one directive, he pledged to deport foreign university students and staff involved in pro-Palestinian protests as part of the crackdown.\n\nHe also created a task force through the attorney general’s office devoted to combating alleged anti-Semitic speech, investigating universities that do not do enough to crack down on such speech.\n\nThe orders and threats come months after huge pro-Palestine, student-led protests swept the country last year as Israel’s genocide raged in Gaza. Students demanded an end to Israel’s military offensive, an end to US support for Israel, and for their universities to divest from companies with ties to Israel.\n\nColumbia University was widely seen as the epicentre of the protests, which resulted in mass arrests and student suspensions, ending in the resignation of the university’s president, Minouche Shafik, several months later.\n\nThe demonstrations also spread to other universities, including Harvard, Yale, and the University of California.\n\nOn Friday — a day before Khalil’s arrest — the Trump administration announced that it was withdrawing $400m in research funding for Columbia.\n\n“Today, we demonstrate to Columbia and other universities that we will not tolerate their appalling inaction any longer,” Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in a statement.\n\nWho is Khalil, and how was he arrested?\n\nKhalil, a Palestinian refugee raised in Syria, graduated in 2024 from Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA). He is married to a US citizen, and his wife is eight months pregnant.\n\nHe was arrested from his university residence on Saturday by ICE agents, the Student Workers of Columbia union said in a statement.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has confirmed the arrest, and in a statement to multiple media organisations, said Khalil was taken into custody as a part of moves made by the agency “in support of President Trump’s executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism”.\n\nIn the statement, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said Khalil “led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization”.\n\nIn a post on X on Sunday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio linked to a news report on Khalil’s arrest and said: “We will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.”\n\nGreer told The Associated Press news agency that ICE agents who arrived at Khalil’s residence initially threatened to arrest his wife too. She said the agents had suggested that Khalil was being held at a facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey. But on Sunday, when his wife tried to visit him there, she was told he was not being kept there.\n\nKhalil was a prominent negotiator on behalf of student protesters as they demanded that the university divest from companies linked to Israel. An encampment set up by student protesters on the campus last year became the epicentre of a nationwide campaign at US universities demanding that Washington stop its unconditional support for Israel, amid the devastating war on Gaza.\n\nCan Trump legally compel universities to stop protests?\n\n“It’s complicated,” said Jenin Younis, a civil liberties and free speech lawyer.\n\n“It’s hard to say that the tweet itself is unlawful since it alone isn’t enforceable,” Younis told Al Jazeera of Trump’s latest post threatening funding. “So, it depends [on] how the administration executes this particular threat, and it has not yet given details.”\n\nRadhika Sainath, a senior lawyer at Palestine Legal, a US-based nonprofit, said the executive orders are not binding rules for universities to follow.\n\n“This executive order sets up a framework to encourage – but not require – schools to spy on and report their non-citizen students and staff,” Sainath told Al Jazeera. “As far as we can tell, these will be non-binding guidelines with no enforcement power or pressure.”\n\nStill, Trump’s directives are extremely concerning, experts said.\n\n“The strength of these orders lies in their chilling effect,” Younes said, adding they are clearly intended to silence First Amendment-protected speech.\n\nFearing consequences, some universities may voluntarily clamp down on speech they believe will subject them to funding cuts, she said, and pressure students and professors alike into silence.\n\nUniversities received $60bn in funding for research and development in 2023, constituting 55 percent of their total budget for science and engineering research.\n\nAccording to Sainath, this is the “most significant escalation in McCarthyite tactics from the Executive Branch regarding Palestine since October 7, [2023]”.\n\nMichael Schaeffer Omer-Man, director of research for Israel-Palestine at the nonprofit DAWN, says Trump’s threats are a “twisted new form of transnational repression”.\n\n“Restricting free speech and expression by cutting state funds, or more accurately, creating a chilling effect by threatening to do so, is a hallmark of autocratic takeovers,” Omer-Man told Al Jazeera, adding that in his view, such tactics can be “as effective as outlawing unpopular political views outright”.\n\nWere universities targeted under Biden’s administration?\n\nYes. Universities that witnessed pro-Palestine protests across the country were also targeted in multiple ways under former US President Joe Biden, who was critical of the student encampments.\n\nUniversity heads had tried, and largely failed, to quell the demonstrations, which often saw the police intervening violently, with videos emerging from different states showing hundreds of students and even faculty members being arrested.\n\nAt Columbia University, several deans resigned, as well as Shafik, who stepped down as president after she was summoned to a congressional committee over allegations the university had failed to protect students and staff from rising anti-Semitism.\n\nAfter the questioning, Shafik allowed police on the campus to arrest students and faced angry calls to resign.\n\nTrump now appears to be doubling down on targeting universities and students. He is “escalating the crackdown” on the Palestine movement and attempting to undermine the students’ and staff’s constitutional rights to speak out and organise, Sainath said.\n\nWill the threats work?\n\nNot on protesters, according to the experts.\n\nOmer-Man said the unprecedented support for Palestine on US campuses was “so powerful precisely because students and faculty already faced consequences for speaking out against Israeli apartheid and stood up anyway”.\n\nStudents have continued to speak up for Palestine ever since Trump unveiled his executive orders.\n\nUniversities, though, are under pressure. This week, Columbia University was forced to reiterate its commitment to “combating anti-Semitism” after Trump’s administration said it could pull more than $50m in contracts between the university and the federal government.\n\nA statement by federal agencies cited the school’s “ongoing inaction in the face of relentless harassment of Jewish students”.\n\nHowever, Omer-Man said young Americans have “never been dissuaded by violent attempts to bury the nation’s conscience”.\n\nSainath agreed.\n\n“Students – and faculty – are continuing to speak out, often at great personal risk, as people of conscience have done throughout history,” she said. “Their voices are key in ending US support for Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza, which is why Israel’s supporters are doing everything they can to stop this growing movement.”\n\nHow might universities respond?\n\nIt might be difficult for universities to legally challenge these executive orders, Younes said.\n\nIt could be “easier to challenge them in a specific case” once the government withholds funds or implements policies pursuant to the executive order, she said.\n\nSainath said it was important for schools to “stay on the right side of history here – they do not have to cooperate and indeed should not cooperate” with these orders.\n\nUniversities should resist pressure to engage in “racist, anti-Palestinian censorship campaigns and protect the right to academic freedom and free speech”, Sainath added.",

        "full_text": "Best Moment\n\nBinyamin Appelbaum Representative Al Green’s stand in defiance of a president who has governed in defiance of the law. Green’s civil disobedience was the behavior of a man who believes that Trump is a threat to American democracy. Why did he stand alone?\n\nJosh Barro Trump boasted of the sharp drop in migrant encounters at the southern border and mocked President Joe Biden’s insistence that better enforcement would require new laws, declaring, “It turned out that all we really needed was a new president.” An effective line on his strongest issue.\n\nFrank Bruni Trump is on solid political ground — and in his comfort zone — when he talks about cracking down on illegal immigration. Among many lies, he truthfully said that fewer migrants were unlawfully crossing the border: “They heard my words, and they chose not to come.” Hard to dispute that.\n\nMichelle Cottle When Trump had the director of the Secret Service make a 13-year-old boy diagnosed with brain cancer an honorary agent. It was a heartwarming plug for the president’s Make America Healthy Again agenda — and a clever way to gloss over the problematic views of his health and human services chief.\n\nMichelle Goldberg Green’s heckling. Democrats shouldn’t have shown up at all, but if they were going to be there, noisy protest made more sense than holding up dumb little paddles. There’s nothing dignified about quietly playing the foil to an autocratic thug gloating about stripping America for parts.\n\nKatherine Mangu-Ward I have long dreamed of a president dedicating a significant portion of a major speech to cuts to the federal government. Alas, the cuts cited by Trump were relatively small, unlikely to withstand scrutiny from the courts or (as in the case of his promises to stop Social Security payments to 129-year-olds) fictional.\n\nDaniel McCarthy The State of the Union and presidential addresses to Congress like Tuesday night’s have become ritualized partisan performances, so when Trump said there was nothing he could do to get Democrats to stand, applaud or smile, he exposed the theatricality of their opposition. (Not that occasional bipartisanship isn’t theatrical, too.)\n\nMatthew Schmitz Trump’s recitation of improbable-sounding expenses he claimed to have cut was funny. More important, it dramatized the growing conviction on the right that too much public money is going to NGOs that operate without direct political accountability.\n\nFarah Stockman Trump is good at made-for-TV moments that celebrate ordinary people — a kid with cancer gets deputized as a U.S. Secret Service agent, a high schooler finds out he got into West Point, a mother is told that her dead daughter has a wildlife refuge named after her.\n\nWorst Moment\n\nAppelbaum It was 90-plus minutes of bad moments — a typical Trump medley of fabrications, provocations and insults. But the worst part was the perversity of Trump performing a democratic ritual even as he breaks this nation’s laws and destroys its institutions.\n\nBarro The section on inflation, which Trump seemed eager to get past because he has nothing to offer. He blamed Biden, he proposed inflationary policies like new tax cuts, and he touted his massive tariffs, despite the “disturbance” they will cause. Voters elected Trump to cut prices, and he is raising them. No wonder he’d rather talk about girls’ volleyball.\n\nBruni What nerve Trump has — accusing Democrats of being too causelessly meanspirited and ceaselessly ungenerous to applaud him as he delivered remarks that, like his entire political career, hinged on mocking and savaging them. Unbelievable. And yet not.\n\nCottle His repeated, literal finger-pointing at the Democratic lawmakers in attendance, as he gloated, trashed Biden and indulged in his characteristic name-calling. “Radical. Left. Lunatics.”\n\nGoldberg Trump’s barrage of easily debunked lies about millions of dead people who could be collecting Social Security checks. The best-case scenario is that he was simply demonstrating, once again, his contempt for the truth, but it seemed like propaganda to justify Social Security cuts.\n\nMangu-Ward Trump’s promise to balance the federal budget was a lie, and everyone in the room knew it. In the coming days, the people in that room will probably pass a continuing resolution that utterly fails to take seriously the real drivers of the deficit: entitlements, military spending and debt service.\n\nMcCarthy The Democrats set themselves up to have the worst moment of the night with their jeering and heckling, especially since it reached full fury as Trump was recounting his popular-vote victory. That made it sound as though the opposition was angry at the American public.\n\nSchmitz The opening section of an overlong speech was wasted on hollow boasting.\n\nStockman When he walked into the Capitol, a place he incited his supporters to storm, cheered by many of the very people who were forced to flee. A very surreal moment.\n\nWhat Else Mattered\n\nAppelbaum The frat boy glee on the Republican side of the aisle.\n\nBarro Trump made good use of Skutniks, especially DJ Daniels, a 13-year-old with cancer whom Trump named as an honorary Secret Service agent. Even though his speech felt interminable — far longer than any State of the Union or joint address to Congress since at least 1964 — these bright moments are what casual observers are likely to see as highlights.\n\nBruni Everything in Trump’s world is extreme, absolute, unnuanced, superlative. Worst ever. Best ever. “Like nothing that has ever been seen before.” Over and over. It’s juvenile. It’s narcissistic. It’s exhausting — like his speech, which made Sunday night’s Oscars seem succinct.\n\nCottle Much of the speech was geared toward painting Democrats as knee-jerk champions of a deeply flawed federal government in which much of the American public has lost faith. Clever.\n\nGoldberg Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has been floating the idea that Trump could reverse his destructive tariffs on Canada and Mexico as soon as Wednesday, but that’s not the message Trump sent on Tuesday night. “Tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs,” he said. “They are about protecting the soul of our country.”\n\nMangu-Ward Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, brought the Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht as his guest. Ulbricht recently received a pardon from Trump, the culmination of years of advocacy by Ulbricht’s mom, Lyn, to free her unjustly imprisoned son.\n\nMcCarthy Trump has become a master of drawing battle lines that put Democrats at a disadvantage, which he did here by weaving guests’ stories of suffering and injustice into his calls for border controls, stronger policing and children’s safety. As controversial as his policies may sound at first, he turns them into common sense.\n\nSchmitz Various European countries have tried Trump’s “gold card” idea to sell citizenship, and several are now backing away from it. It’s a scheme the United States will also come to regret.\n\nStockman Trump didn’t gloat as much as I would have expected when he read a message from President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine offering to sign a mineral deal that was derailed last week after a testy press availability with Trump and his entourage.",

        "full_text": "Fact-checking Trump's address to Congress\n\n5 March 2025\n\nLucy Gilder, Jake Horton & Ben Chu\n\nBBC Verfiy\n\nIn his address to Congress, which ran for more than an hour and a half, President Donald Trump made a series of claims about the state of the US under his predecessor Joe Biden and the achievements of his first weeks in office.\n\nHe returned to key campaign themes including illegal immigration, rising prices and what he called \"appalling waste\" in government spending.\n\nBBC Verify has looked into the facts behind some of his key claims.\n\nDid Trump inherit an economic catastrophe?\n\nTrump said he inherited an \"economic catastrophe\" from Biden.\n\nThis is misleading. The US economy was growing at an annual rate of 2.3% in the final quarter of 2024 under the previous administration. It expanded by 2.8% over 2024 as a whole according to official US statistics.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund estimates that the US growth rate in 2024 was faster than any other nation in the G7.\n\nOn rising prices, Trump added \"we suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country\".\n\nInflation under Biden peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 - the highest level since 1981 - so not quite as far back as Trump claimed.\n\nThe 2022 peak was in the context of high inflation in the rest of the world in the wake of the Covid pandemic and a global energy shock. The inflation rate had dropped to 3% by the time Trump took office.\n\nInflation has also been much higher than 9% at several other points in US history, including the 1940s and 1920s.\n\nDid Biden let egg prices get out of control?\n\nTrump went on to blame Biden for egg prices, claiming he \"let the price of eggs get out of control\".\n\nPrices are high, but this has been linked to a bird flu outbreak in the US.\n\nEgg prices rose under Biden in 2023, and in January a dozen eggs averaged over $5, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). That is 53% above the average for the whole of 2024.\n\nThe USDA has said a bird flu outbreak has led to US farmers having to kill millions of chickens, creating egg shortages, and has announced a $1bn (£780m) plan to help combat the issue.\n\nThe outbreak started in February 2022 and last year the Biden administration allocated more than $800m to tackle it.\n\nThe Trump administration recently fired a number of USDA officials who worked on the government's response to bird flu as part of cost-cutting measures by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). They are now reportedly attempting to rehire some of them.\n\nHas Doge found hundreds of billions in fraud?\n\nTrump praised Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) and claimed the advisory body had found \"hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud\" in federal government spending.\n\nNo evidence has been provided for this figure.\n\nOn its official website, Doge states that it has saved an estimated $105bn, from fraud detection, contract and grant cancellations, real estate lease terminations, asset sales, workforce reductions, programmatic changes, and regulatory savings.\n\nHowever, that figure cannot be independently verified as, so far, Doge has only published \"receipts\" for contract, grant and real estate lease cancellations on the website. These add up to about $18.6bn. We have asked the White House for evidence of the remaining $86bn of savings.\n\nUS media outlets have also highlighted some accounting errors. For example, Doge initially listed its largest saving of $8bn from scrapping an immigration agency contract - it later corrected this to $8m.\n\nWas February the lowest ever month for border crossings?\n\nSpeaking about his actions to tackle illegal immigration, Trump said that \"as a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded\".\n\nThis is true.\n\nIn February 2025, 8,326 encounters of migrants at the south-west border with Mexico were recorded by US Border Patrol.\n\nThis is the lowest level since monthly records began in 2000.\n\nBy comparison, there were 140,641 encounters by US Border Patrol at this border in February last year under Biden.\n\nNumbers fell to 47,316 in December 2024.\n\nDid 21 million migrants enter US under Biden?\n\nContinuing with illegal migration, Trump claimed: \"Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States\".\n\nThere is no evidence for a figure this high.\n\nEncounters with migrants at the borders - a measure of illegal migration - reached 10 million under Biden but this does not mean this many people stayed in the US.\n\nIt is impossible to know exactly how many illegal immigrants have come to the US, as many will have evaded law enforcement agencies, but several estimates put the number at around half what Trump stated.\n\nA report published by the Office of Homeland Security last year estimated the number of illegal immigrants living in the US, as of January 2022, at 11 million.\n\nIt says about a fifth of them arrived in 2010 or later but the majority arrived before this time, some as early as the 1980s.\n\nHas the US spent $350bn on Ukraine?\n\nCorrection: an earlier version of this article stated that migrant encounters at the south-west border fell to 96,000 at the end of 2024. While this is correct for overall encounters here, the number recorded by Border Patrol was 47,316.\n\nAdditional reporting by Shayan Sardarizadeh & Anthony Reuben.",

Al Green for disrupting President Trump’s joint address to Congress.\n\nMr. Green, Texas Democrat, stood up during the first few minutes of the address Tuesday night and shook his cane at the president in response to Mr. Trump declaring he has a mandate from voters to carry out his agenda.\n\n“You have no mandate,” Mr. Green shouted.\n\nHis attempts to disrupt the president prompted warnings from Mr. Johnson and when he did not relent, the speaker had the House sergeant-at-arms remove Mr. Green from the chamber.\n\nMr. Johnson said on Fox News after the speech that he would not tolerate such “shameful” behavior on the House floor, noting Mr. Green’s attacks on the president violate the body’s rules on decorum.\n\n“I suspect that there’ll be a censure resolution brought on the floor to discipline him,” the speaker said. “We have to do that inside the House.

        "full_text": "Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino.\n\nSummary\n\nIn his first address to a joint session of Congress in his second term, President Donald Trump distorted the facts on fraud, immigration, aid to Ukraine, the economy, autism and more.\n\nTrump claimed that the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has “found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud.” However, the DOGE website currently states that the department has only generated $105 billion in savings, and only purports to provide evidence to support $19.8 billion of that total. It’s unclear how much, if any, of that is related to fraud.\n\nThe president read data purportedly showing that millions of dead individuals were incorrectly labeled as alive in the Social Security database, and misleadingly claimed that “money is being paid to many of them.” Social Security Administration internal audits show that the number of dead recipients still being sent benefits is likely in the thousands, not the millions.\n\nIn talking about aid to support Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s invasion, Trump inflated U.S. aid by about double when he claimed that the U.S. has “spent perhaps $350 billion,” and he wrongly claimed Europe had spent only $100 billion. European aid is larger than that from the U.S.\n\nTrump exaggerated when he claimed to have “inherited … an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare” from his predecessor. Economic growth was strong, and inflation had fallen significantly.\n\nHe also wrongly said that inflation was “perhaps” the worst in history under President Joe Biden, and he ignored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic while claiming that the Biden administration “drove up” prices on energy, groceries and other necessities.\n\nTrump misleadingly claimed that “not long ago” just 1 in 10,000 children had autism. Estimates that low are from many decades ago, before the definition and awareness of the condition expanded.\n\nHe misleadingly said Biden’s administration had “closed more than 100 power plants.” According to the Department of Energy, the total number of electric power plants increased by 2,187 from 2020 to 2023. Coal- and petroleum-powered plants decreased.\n\nWhile talking about building up America’s military might, Trump claimed that “now we have the technology” for an air defense system to protect the U.S. like Israel’s Iron Dome. But that technology has not been developed yet, and weapons experts question its feasibility for protecting the entire U.S.\n\nTrump repeated his unsupported claim that “people from mental institutions and insane asylums were released into our country,” and he exaggerated when he again claimed that under Biden “21 million people poured into the United States.”\n\nThe president misleadingly lumped Canada in with Mexico as a significant source of fentanyl in the U.S., claiming those countries have “allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before.” Less than 1% of fentanyl seized by border officials comes through Canada.\n\nIn pushing for more oil and natural gas drilling, Trump, again, falsely claimed that “we have more liquid gold under our feet” than all other nations. There are several countries that have larger estimated oil and natural gas reserves than the U.S.\n\nHe repeated his false claims that 38,000 American lives were lost during construction of the Panama Canal and that Panama had ceded control of the canal to China.\n\nWhile this address, coming early in a new term, technically isn’t a State of the Union address, Trump’s March 4 speech was longer than any prior SOTU, clocking in at an hour and 39 minutes, as measured by the American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\n\nAnalysis\n\nDOGE Savings\n\nTrump claimed that the Department of Government Efficiency, led by White House adviser Elon Musk, has “found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud.” However, the most recent update on DOGE’s website from March 2 reports that the department has only created an estimated $105 billion in savings thus far. Although Trump ticked off several examples of what he called “appalling waste” found by DOGE, it’s unclear if any of the savings touted by DOGE are related to actual fraud.\n\nWe also cannot verify DOGE’s savings figure, as the department has not yet uploaded evidence of each transaction it has conducted. The website includes a “Wall of Receipts” described as “a subset of contract, grant, and lease cancellations, representing ~30% of total savings.”\n\nHowever, the “subset” of transactions listed on the website does not meet this 30% threshold. In total, DOGE’s “Wall of Receipts” lists about $19.8 billion in estimated savings, which is less than 19% of the $105 billion in total savings claimed by the department. Of this $19.8 billion in savings, $8.9 billion comes from the cancellation of contracts, $10.3 billion comes from the termination of grants, and $660 million comes from the termination of government leases.\n\nDOGE has faced scrutiny for inflating and miscalculating the savings figures posted on its website. The New York Times reported that DOGE deleted hundreds of transactions previously posted to its “Wall of Receipts” and also found that DOGE incorrectly claimed credit for canceling government contracts that had already been terminated before Trump entered office. Other errors by DOGE identified in media reports include a typo mislabeling $8 million in savings as $8 billion and triple-counting the cancellation of a single contract.\n\nSpeaking about DOGE’s efforts on Feb. 11, Musk said, “We will make mistakes, but we’ll act quickly to correct any mistakes.”\n\nTrump went on to cite a Government Accountability Office report that estimated annual fraud losses to the government of between $233 billion and $521 billion. But we could not verify how much, if any, of the DOGE savings identified to date includes instances of fraud. Rather, most of the savings appears to be related to spending that it deemed wasteful.\n\nOverstating Social Security Fraud\n\nIn a Feb. 16 post on X, White House adviser Elon Musk shared a screenshot of a spreadsheet denoting that the Social Security database categorizes nearly 21 million people over the age of 99 as alive. Trump read the data from Musk’s post during his speech and misleadingly claimed that “money is being paid to many of” the centenarians still listed as alive.\n\nAs we’ve written, internal audits conducted by the Office of Audit in the Social Security Administration’s Office of the Inspector General have identified that millions of deceased individuals were still listed as living in the Social Security database. However, the number of dead recipients still being sent benefits is likely in the thousands, not the millions.\n\nIn total, the SSA distributed payments to 89,106 individuals aged 99 and older in December 2024.\n\nA July 2023 report published by the Office of Audit found that there were 18.9 million people with Social Security numbers born in 1920 or earlier with no record of their deaths. The vast majority of these records are clearly outdated, as the Pew Research Center estimated that there were only 101,000 Americans who were 100 and older in 2024.\n\nHowever, very few of these dead individuals incorrectly labeled as alive still receive Social Security benefits. Among this group of 18.9 million, the report found that only 44,000, or 0.2%, were still receiving Social Security benefits. The report did not specify how many of these benefit payments were believed to be improper. A portion of the 44,000 recipients were likely living Americans over the age of 103 who continued to receive payments in July 2023.\n\nThe Office of Audit provided a more specific estimate of improper payments to deceased individuals in a November 2021 report. That report concluded that the “SSA issued approximately $298 million in payments to about 24,000 deceased beneficiaries in suspended payment status.” The report also noted that while the SSA did recover some of the funds, $214 million of the improper payments remained unaccounted for.\n\nIn a statement published on Feb. 19, Lee Dudek, the newly appointed acting commissioner of the SSA, explained that the data posted by Musk does not reveal millions of dead individuals who continue to receive benefits.\n\n“I also want to acknowledge recent reporting about the number of people older than age 100 who may be receiving benefits from Social Security,” he said. “The reported data are people in our records with a Social Security number who do not have a date of death associated with their record. These individuals are not necessarily receiving benefits.”\n\nIn September 2015, the SSA began a process that automatically designates individuals aged 115 and older as deceased and ends payments to them.\n\nExaggerating Ukraine Aid\n\nTrump repeated a claim he’s made frequently in recent weeks – telling the joint session of Congress that “we’ve spent perhaps $350 billion” to support Ukraine’s fight against the Russian invasion since 2022, while Europe has spent $100 billion. Those figures are wrong.\n\nAs we’ve written before, the total amount that Congress has appropriated since 2022 is $174.2 billion. According to a report from the special inspector general who is overseeing the U.S. support for Ukraine, the U.S. has made a total of $182.75 billion available for the broader response.\n\nFigures from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German research organization that tracks funding for Ukraine, show that the U.S. has so far allocated about $121 billion compared with about $140 billion from Europe. Additionally, the institute shows that Europe has committed another $122 billion that hasn’t yet been allocated, while the U.S. has committed another $5 billion. The institute’s figures include direct, bilateral aid.\n\nWe didn’t get an immediate response from the White House to an email asking where Trump had gotten his numbers.\n\nWhat Trump Inherited\n\nTrump exaggerated the state of the economy when he took office earlier this year, and he misleadingly placed the blame for higher consumer prices solely on the Biden administration.\n\n“As you know, we inherited, from the last administration, an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare,” Trump said. “Their policies drove up energy prices, pushed up the cost of groceries, and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions of Americans. We suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country — they’re not sure.”\n\nAs we wrote in January, before Trump began his second presidential term, he inherited a “resilient economy that has grown by at least 2.5% every year since he left office in early 2021,” as well as a “post-pandemic jobs boom that has driven the unemployment rate well below the historical norm.”\n\nWe also noted that inflation “has come down significantly” from the annual inflation rate of 9.1% in June 2022. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said that was “the largest 12-month change since the period ending November 1981” — not in history, as Trump said. Most recently, the Consumer Price Index increased 3% for the 12-month period ending in January.\n\nIt’s also wrong to suggest that Biden administration policies alone increased prices on energy, food and other consumer goods. As we’ve also written, economists primarily blame the COVID-19 pandemic, the supply chain disruptions that followed and rising labor costs, among other reasons, for the dramatic price increases while Biden was president.\n\nAutism\n\nShortly after introducing DJ Daniel, a 13-year-old who was diagnosed six years ago with brain cancer, Trump cited two autism prevalence figures that need context.\n\n“Our goal is to get toxins out of our environment, poisons out of our food supply, and keep our children healthy and strong,” the president said. “As an example, not long ago — and you can’t even believe these numbers — 1 in 10,000 children had autism. 1 in 10,000. And now it’s 1 in 36. There’s something wrong. 1 in 36 — think of it.\n\n“So we’re going to find out what it is and there’s nobody better than Bobby and all of the people that are working with you,” he continued, referring to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., “to figure out what is going on.”\n\nTrump made nearly identical remarks about the autism rate on Feb. 13 when swearing in Kennedy as the new health secretary.\n\nTrump’s higher figure of 1 in 36 is correct. That’s the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s latest estimate, in 2020, of the number of U.S. children who have been identified with autism.\n\nThe 1 in 10,000 number, however, is decades old — and isn’t directly comparable to today’s figure. As we’ve explained before, some studies in the 1960s and ’70s estimated autism affected about 1 to 5 in 10,000 kids. But these studies used a much more stringent definition of autism. Awareness and recognition of autism has also dramatically improved since then.\n\nMuch of “what is going on,” then, is actually a broader clinical definition of autism capturing more mild cases, along with better awareness. There may be a slight true increase in the condition, researchers say, in part due to known risk factors, including parents having children at older ages and more babies surviving birth complications. Autism is largely a genetic disease.\n\nKennedy and others around him have previously used the same or similar statistics to falsely suggest that vaccines may be behind the surge in autism diagnoses. Numerous studies have failed to find any link between autism and vaccines.\n\nPower Plants\n\nTrump said the Biden administration had “closed more than 100 power plants.” That’s misleading. The number of electric power plants went up by 2,187 since the last full year of Trump’s first administration to 2023, according to the latest data from the Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration.\n\nThe number of power plants fueled by coal did decrease by 57 plants, from 284 in 2020 to 227 in 2023. Plants powered by petroleum and other fossil gas also declined by 23 plants. But the number of other types of electric power plants, including natural gas and renewable energy, went up.\n\nIn April 2024, a rule finalized by the Biden administration to limit the pollution from existing coal power plants required those plants, and any new natural gas-fired power plants, to capture 90% of their carbon emissions by 2032, if they intend to operate after 2039. The rule was contested by some Republican states and industry groups, but in October the Supreme Court decided that the rule could go into effect while legal cases work their way through the courts. During his campaign, Trump promised to kill Biden’s power plant rules.\n\nEnergy Secretary Chris Wright recently advocated for the need for coal-fired power plants, Bloomberg reported. In February, the EIA reported that electricity generators plan to retire about 8 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity this year.\n\nDuring his address to Congress on Tuesday night, Trump said, “We are opening up many of those power plants right now.”\n\nGolden Dome Defense System\n\nTrump said he is focused on “building the most powerful military of the future,” and one of the first steps will be building a “Golden Dome missile defense shield to protect our homeland.”\n\n“Ronald Reagan wanted to do it long ago,” Trump said, “but the technology just wasn’t there, not even close. But now we have the technology. It’s incredible, actually. And other places, they have it. Israel has it. Other places have it, and the United States should have it too, right?”\n\nBut the technology for the U.S. isn’t there yet.\n\nTrump said repeatedly during his campaign that during his presidency the U.S. would develop a missile defense system similar to Israel’s Iron Dome. Israel has used that air defense system since 2011 to shoot down short-range rockets fired from neighboring Gaza. Israel’s Iron Dome, along with its Arrow 3 system — an air defense system that can intercept ballistic missiles — and with help from the U.S. and others, shot down nearly 300 drones and missiles launched at Israel by Iran in April 2024.\n\nIsrael’s system, developed by an Israeli company and the U.S. weapons manufacturer Raytheon, can detect and intercept “a variety of shorter-range targets such as rockets, artillery and mortars,” Raytheon’s website explains. The system can target threats launched from 2.5 to 43.5 miles away.\n\nBut “against the normal threats to U.S. security, the Iron Dome is not a useful system,” Stephen Biddle, adjunct senior fellow for defense policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, told us when we wrote about this issue last year. “Iron Dome is designed to deal with short-range threats, especially unguided rockets,” not long-range ballistic missiles that could be launched by China, Russia or North Korea.\n\n“If the North Koreans launched intercontinental ballistic missiles at the U.S., an Iron Dome would not be able to intercept reentry vehicles,” explained Biddle, referring to the parts of intercontinental ballistic missiles carrying warheads back into Earth’s atmosphere before hitting a target.\n\nThe defense technology company Lockheed Martin is apparently working on a “Golden Dome” system that Trump referred to in his remarks to Congress, and the Pentagon is seeking proposals from other defense contractors. The Lockheed Martin website says, “[W]e will bring in the best and brightest of American innovation to rapidly develop game-changing tech – like space-based interceptors and hypersonic defenses – that will ensure America’s Golden Dome stays well ahead of adversary threats.”\n\nBut the Golden Dome technology is still being developed, and defense experts are skeptical that a missile defense system will be able to protect the entire U.S.\n\nImmigration\n\nTrump made several misleading and unsupported claims about immigration.\n\nTrump began by boasting that after declaring a national emergency on the southern border and cracking down on illegal immigration, by February, his first full month in office, apprehensions of those crossing the border illegally “were by far the lowest ever recorded.”\n\nAlthough U.S. Customs and Border Protection has not yet released its official February apprehensions data, the agency reported via X on March 1 that February “saw just 8,326 encounters at the Southwest border—the lowest documented by U.S. Border Patrol.” That eclipses the figure of 11,127 in April 2017, Trump’s third full month in office during his first term — and previously the lowest month going back to at least 2000. However, it’s not the lowest “ever recorded.” Government data going back to 1925 shows entire years in the 1920s and 1930s that were close to the February figure.\n\nTrump went on to say that under Biden, “there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month.” Illegal immigration did soar through most of the years Biden was in office, with apprehensions by Border Patrol averaging about 150,000 per month. Apprehensions reached a monthly high of 251,178 in December 2023.\n\nBut the numbers dropped dramatically after Biden enacted emergency measures in June 2024 to restrict asylum eligibility for those illegal border-crossers. Between July and December, the last full month under Biden, apprehensions of people crossing the border illegally averaged about 55,000 per month. That’s lower than the average during the last few months of Trump’s first term.\n\nWe should note that after tough talk on immigration in the 2016 campaign, the number of apprehensions plummeted in the first few months of Trump’s first term as well, what some referred to as “the Trump Effect.” After that dip in the months immediately after he took office, apprehensions of illegal border-crossers steadily increased over the next two years, reaching a peak of 132,856 in May 2019. The figures then began to steadily decline again, going to 16,182 in April 2020 at the height of the pandemic.\n\nTrump also made his oft-repeated but unsupported claim that “people from mental institutions and insane asylums were released into our country.” As we have written, immigration experts in the U.S. and in countries in South America where Trump has alleged that kind of activity have told us they have seen no evidence of that.\n\nAnd finally, Trump claimed that “over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States.” As we have written, that’s double the total number of people caught trying to enter the country illegally (7.3 million, which includes repeat attempts), those who came to legal ports of entry without authorization to enter (1.2 million), and the estimated number who evaded capture (2 million). Comprehensive Department of Homeland Security data on the initial processing of these encounters show that 2.9 million were removed by CBP and 3.2 million were released with notices to appear in immigration court or report to Immigration and Customs Enforcement or given other classifications, such as parole.\n\nFentanyl Smuggling\n\nWhile talking about his reasons for putting new 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, Trump claimed that both countries have “allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens.” But comparing Canada to Mexico is misleading.\n\nNo one knows exactly how much illicit fentanyl comes into the U.S. each year because comprehensive data is not available. U.S. Customs and Border Protection does publish drug seizure statistics, which are often used as a proxy for how much gets into the country undetected.\n\nThe 43 pounds of fentanyl seized by authorities at the northern border in fiscal year 2024 is more than the 2 pounds seized in fiscal 2023 and the 14 pounds seized in fiscal 2022. But that is significantly less than the 21,148 pounds of fentanyl seized by officials at the southwest border with Mexico during the 2024 fiscal cycle.\n\nAs we’ve written, for at least the last three full fiscal years, the amount of fentanyl captured coming into the U.S. from Canada has made up less than 1% of the fentanyl seized nationwide by the Border Patrol and the Office of Field Operations.\n\n‘Liquid Gold’\n\nTrump repeated a false claim about the oil and natural gas reserves in the U.S.\n\n“As you’ve heard me say many times, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on earth, and by far,” Trump said. “And now, I fully authorize the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it. It’s called drill, baby, drill.”\n\nAs we’ve written before, Trump is wrong. The Brookings Institution has noted that while “estimating reserves is an inexact science and methodologies differ,” the U.S. generally ranks between ninth and 11th in the world in the size of its crude oil reserves, and it ranks fourth or fifth in recoverable natural gas reserves.\n\nAnd although Trump would like oil and gas companies to do more drilling, it’s worth noting that oil and gas production in the U.S. already reached new record levels in 2024.\n\nPanama Canal\n\nTrump wrongly repeated his claims that 38,000 American lives were lost during construction of the Panama Canal and that Panama had ceded control of the canal to China.\n\nThe canal was “built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure, 38,000 workers died building the Panama Canal. They died of malaria. They died of snake bites and mosquitoes. Not a nice place to work,” Trump said.\n\nAs we have written, Trump grossly overstates the number of American lives lost building the canal. About 7,600 people died during the more than decade-long American phase of the construction of the Panama Canal, which started in 1904, according to Noel Maurer, an associate professor of international affairs and international business at George Washington University, and co-author of the book, “The Big Ditch: How America Took, Built, Ran, and Ultimately Gave Away the Panama Canal.”\n\nMost of those deaths weren’t Americans, Maurer told us via email. “Rather, about two-thirds of them were either West Indian (mostly from Barbados), and a smaller unknown share of Spanish laborers who were hired at the start of construction.” In total, fewer than 1,000 Americans died due to accident or infectious disease during the canal’s construction phase, he said.\n\nTrump also continued to falsely suggest that China has been operating the canal.\n\nThe canal “was given away by the Carter administration for $1 but that agreement has been violated very severely,” Trump said. “We didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.”\n\nIt’s not accurate to say the canal was given to China. A Hong Kong-based company managed ports at either end of the canal, which has raised concerns among some in the U.S., including the head of U.S. Southern Command, who last year warned Congress the ports could be used by the Chinese military as “points of future multi-domain access.” But canal experts and Panamanian officials have said China had no involvement in operation of the canal.\n\nAnd in any case, as Trump noted in his speech, an American investment group led by BlackRock has agreed to purchase both ports owned by the Hong Kong company.",

        "full_text": "When the 2024 election turned an ex-president into the next president, most Americans — no matter their feelings about Donald Trump — must have quite reasonably assumed they knew exactly what they were getting.\n\nIt turns out they didn’t know — not exactly.\n\nThe 43 days of his second term have revealed a president in the grip of a set of large ideas that were an occasional but far from a paramount feature of his first term. This version of Trump is more serious — determined to dismember large parts of the federal government and upend relations between the United States and the rest of the world on trade and security. He is ready to pursue these ideas in a sustained and pitiless way, all the while asserting vast new powers for himself as president.\n\nThis version of Trump cherry-picked examples of federal spending that sounded dubious or even inane, like a purported $20 million to subsidize an Arab version of “Sesame Street” in the Middle East. He asserted that Social Security databases supposedly include many millions of people over the age of 120. He waged cultural warfare, promising to stand up to school systems allegedly proselytizing on behalf of gender fluidity for confused young adolescents against parental wishes.\n\nThe speech, infused with a MAGA-brand overhaul of conservatism, was as if a classic Ronald Reagan speech were recrafted for late-night delivery at a tavern in Queens. He made a dozen or so references to his immediate predecessor, calling Biden “the worst president in American history.” He accurately noted that attempted border crossings from Mexico have plunged dramatically since he came into office and asserted that Democrats allowed “murderers, drug dealers, gang members and people from mental institutions and insane asylums … into our country. Who would want to do that?”\n\nThis was above all a speech aimed at communicating with Trump’s 2024 coalition. That includes large numbers of voters who share his grievances and are zealously devoted to him, combined with just enough additional voters who might not be crazy about Trump but think the Democrats are too out of touch to be an acceptable alternative.\n\nThe speech included almost no language aimed at persuading Democrats that there are some issues on which they could work with him. It’s clear that the only pathway to that would be them admitting they were wrong for all these years and Trump is great after all. His aim, instead, was to use the opposition party as speech props.\n\n“I look at the Democrats in front of me, and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy, or to make them stand or smile or applaud,” Trump taunted. “I could find a cure to the most devastating disease, a disease that would wipe out entire nations, or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history, or the stoppage of crime to the lowest levels ever recorded. And these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements.”\n\nTrump is so aggressive in his rhetorical style that it can be easy to overlook that he can also be a shrewdly defensive-minded politician. He called out Elon Musk in the House gallery but didn’t offer any extended defense of the most controversial dimensions of the administration’s efforts to use the Department of Government Efficiency to sharply cut the federal workforce, or the White House’s campaign to strip the independence of federal agencies that have been historically insulated from politics. These efforts are already immersed in legal battles, most likely to be settled by the Supreme Court justices who watched Trump’s speech from the front row.\n\nInstead, he offered himself as an evangelist for common sense and kept the argument on examples of foreign aid spending that he knows is unpopular with many Americans, such as “$8 million to promote LGBTQI+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of.”\n\nHe was eager to talk about cultural issues, such as his executive orders making English the country’s official language or that federal policy is that “there are only two genders — male and female.” But he didn’t make a mention of opposition to legal abortion, the cultural issue that sustained the conservative movement for a half-century.\n\nLast week, Trump dominated conversation in Washington and around the world when he and Vice President JD Vance denounced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy before cameras in the Oval Office as an ingrate and threatened to abandon further U.S. support for Ukraine’s effort to fight a Russian invasion. In the speech, however, Trump announced that Zelenskyy wrote him a letter of appreciation and is ready for Trump’s mediation in peace talks.\n\nFor as long as Trump has been a national figure — dating to the 1980s, decades before he formally entered politics — he has some enduring political instincts. He has consistently warned that America risks decline by letting other countries take unfair advantage and has rarely hesitated to engage in hot-button cultural debates.\n\nEven in the first term, however, these instincts didn’t always coalesce into a fully developed ideological program. He appointed conservative judges. He started but did not finish a promised wall on the southern border. But his interests could seem episodic, bouncing around with the news.\n\nIt is now clear that the four years he spent out of power were devoted — by him and by key lieutenants in his administration — to a detailed plan for what they would do if and when he got back in. And it is clear from Tuesday night’s speech that he is confident in his ability to sell a breathtakingly ambitious and divisive agenda to a majority of Americans.",

        "full_text": "President Trump delivered the first congressional address of his second term on Tuesday evening.\n\nIt was a chance for the president to underscore the sweeping changes he has wrought in the six weeks since he returned to the White House — and to defend those moves from his many critics.\n\nThe days preceding the address were dominated by two issues: Ukraine and the economy.\n\nThe first topic is in a state of flux amid reverberations from last week’s fractious meeting between Trump, Vice President Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nOn the economy, stock markets swooned Tuesday amid concerns about Trump’s newest tariffs, aimed at Mexico, Canada and China.\n\nOn Tuesday night, there was much other news too.\n\nHere are the big takeaways.\n\nTrump set out his case from the speech’s opening moments, characterizing his first weeks back in office as being marked by “swift and unrelenting action.”\n\nIn the roughly 100 minutes that followed, he put flesh on that argument, referencing his restrictions on illegal immigration, his executive orders assailing “wokeness,” the work of billionaire ally Elon Musk and Trump’s own assault on what he calls Washington’s bureaucratic “swamp.”\n\nMusk was present for the address — dressed, uncharacteristically, in a suit — while some Democrats held signs proclaiming “Musk steals.”\n\nTrump claimed popular opinion is the wind at his back: “Americans have given us a mandate for bold and profound change.”\n\nBut have they?\n\nTrump defeated former Vice President Kamala Harris by just 1.5 percentage points in the popular vote last November, polls show Americans closely split on his performance thus far, and Musk, a central figure, seems to grow more divisive by the day.\n\nTrump adopted a taunting tone toward Democrats during much of the address.\n\nThe president called former President Biden “the worst president in American history,” referenced the criminal cases that he had faced, asking, “How did that work out?” and resurrected an old derogatory nickname for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) when she applauded in support of continued aid for Ukraine.\n\n“Do you want to keep it going for another five years? Yeah? You would say — Pocahontas says yes,” Trump said, nodding in Warren’s direction.\n\nWarren, asked a short time later if she was surprised by the jab, said, “No. The whole speech was a fantasy that Donald Trump tries to construct.”\n\nTrump took a less hostile tone toward Zelensky than he has during the past week. But it remains unclear exactly how the president sees the path forward.\n\nThe president said he had received a letter from Zelensky earlier Tuesday, though he appeared to be referencing the same message the Ukrainian president had posted on social media.\n\nNonetheless, Trump characterized the message as “important” — especially with respect to the Ukrainian willingness to make peace and to sign on to the mineral rights deal the U.S. has sought.\n\nBut the president made no promises of security guarantees, which the Ukrainians regard as vital.\n\nTrump contended his administration had held “serious discussions with Russia and have received strong signals that they are ready for peace.”\n\n“Wouldn’t that be beautiful?” he added.\n\nHe provided no specificity on what those “signals” might be, nor on what, if anything, Russian President Vladimir Putin might be prepared to concede to end the war that his February 2022 invasion started.\n\nTrump’s pause of military aid to Ukraine, which has caused tremors across Europe, remains in place.\n\nImmigration was Trump’s single strongest issue during last year’s election campaign, with polls showing voters preferred his harder line over the Democrats’ approach by a wide margin.\n\nIt was, therefore, no surprise that Trump leaned hard into the issue Tuesday night.\n\nOne of his loudest applause lines came when he mocked those who had suggested that significant reductions in unauthorized migration could only come through the passage of major legislation.\n\n“It turned out all we really needed was a new president,” he said, sparking a roar of approval from Republicans in the chamber.\n\nTrump also emphasized the most emotive elements of the issue, paying tribute to Laken Riley, the 22-year-old college student killed by an unauthorized migrant in Georgia in 2024, and to Jocelyn Nungaray, a 12-year-old girl killed in Texas, also in 2024. Two unauthorized migrants have been charged with Nungaray’s murder.\n\nRiley’s sister and mother attended the speech, as did Nungaray’s mother. All three were acknowledged directly by Trump.\n\nMore broadly, Trump contended that his “most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history” was helping to achieve “the great liberation of America.”\n\nOne of the most telling passages in the address came with Trump’s defense of his tariffs — and the notably tepid response it received even from Republicans.\n\nTrump’s rationale for the tariffs appeared rather meandering at times.\n\nHe contended they were necessary to stop the United States being taken advantage of by other nations, would help American farmers stave off foreign competition, and would boost the nation’s finances.\n\nBut the fact that his speech took place on a second day of steep stock market falls — and amid consternation from some conservatives — took the luster off those arguments.\n\n“Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it’s happening, and it will happen rather quickly,” Trump said.\n\n“There’ll be a little disturbance, but we’re OK with that. It won’t be much,” Trump insisted.\n\nRepublicans duly applauded but with notably less zest than when Trump was on safer ground, defending his immigration restrictions or weighing in on the culture wars.\n\nRep. Al Green (D-Texas) interrupted Trump with heckling early in the speech.\n\nGreen was hitting back at Trump’s assertion that he had a broad mandate, protesting that the president had no “mandate to cut Medicaid.”\n\nAfter a warning from Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) that Green was engaging in a “breach of decorum,” the Texas congressman — who filed articles of impeachment against Trump several times during his first term, and said he would do so again last month — continued to voice his objections.\n\nGreen was ultimately escorted from the chamber without resistance.\n\nSoon after, Green told reporters he had launched his protest because it was the most effective method to “get across to a person who uses … his incivility against our civility.”\n\nGreen also acknowledged he might face some form of sanction for his protest.\n\n“Whatever the punishment is, I’m not fighting the punishment,” Green said.\n\nAlexander Bolton and Jared Gans contributed.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc.

        "full_text": "In a few weeks, Donald Trump has done what his prevaricating predecessor declared to be impossible: he has brought the border under control. Those of us who watch the goings and comings of illegal border crossings are familiar that Donald Trump 45 did a stellar job of taking a border crisis and bringing it within appropriate management.\n\nFor instance, in the Yuma sector alone, Trump 45 brought encounters with illegal aliens to a previously unheard of 8600 in the last year of Trump’s first term. That was astounding, especially in light of Biden’s border crisis which often saw more encounters in a weekend than in Trump’s entire last year.\n\nBut now, under Trump 47’s policies, the number of encounters has dropped to about 8600 for the entire border—north, south, land, and sea. Miraculous, some would say. ICE’s arrests of illegals have increased over 600% compared to Biden. Migrant shelters have shut down due to a lack of use. I say it is a monumental change. Unheard of. What President Trump 47 has done is to demonstrate clearly that enforcing the law is the biggest inducement for illegal aliens to stay away or to go home.\n\nDuring one briefing I had with top CBP leaders, I was told that caravans that had formed during Biden’s last days in office, and were trying to get to the border before President Trump was inaugurated, had turned around the day of his inauguration. Simply promising to enforce the law and prevent entry had caused caravans of those intent on breaching our border to disband.\n\nThis kind of border control has never been established under any previous presidential administration. And what do the Leftists who control some of our major cities have to say?\n\nIn Denver, the Mayor promised a “Tiananmen Square moment” to prevent enforcement of our laws. Of course, his promise of obstruction of legal enforcement activities shows his contempt for the law.\n\nHe joins the mayors of Chicago, Boston, Tucson, and the governors of Arizona and California in proclaiming their jurisdictions off limits to enforcement of immigration laws. They are the last holdouts of lawlessness in a nation that has been ravaged by an invasion of illegal aliens under the malevolent Biden Administration.\n\nNever forget that Biden and his Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas insisted that the borders should be open and humane. The result was millions of illegal aliens poured into America, many hundreds of thousands were criminals who preyed upon American citizens.\n\nBiden and Mayorkas claimed that there was no way to stop the onslaught, so they created programs to facilitate illegal entry into the United States, prevent law enforcement from doing its job, and launder billions of dollars to cartels through nongovernment organizations (NGOs).\n\nBiden and Mayorkas attempted to kill our border and American sovereignty under the guise of humanity. They didn’t care about human smuggling, trafficking, child trafficking, and sex trafficking. They didn’t care about the rapine imposed upon most women and girls and many men and boys by the violently evil criminal cartels who controlled our southern border. They didn’t flinch at the hundreds of thousands of Americans who died due to fentanyl poisoning.\n\nThe policies of Joe Biden and Alejandro Mayorkas will forever be a stain on America.\n\nThe border is now almost completely controlled by America, not Mexican drug and human trafficking cartels.\n\nThat only has happened because President Trump has the will and leadership skills to allow our law enforcement to actually enforce the law. Trump said he would do it. He is doing it. Kudos to him, the leadership at the Department of Homeland Security, and its enforcement agencies. And thanks to the frontline CBP agents and ICE officers.\n\nAmerica is safer now. Our borders are better now. Trump is delivering on one of his signature campaign promises. While the Left in America is face-melting, the majority of us recognize the success on the border of President Trump.",

        "full_text": "A federal appeals court on Wednesday allowed the Trump administration to remove a top federal ethics watchdog from his office while a lawsuit challenging his termination plays out.\n\nThe order permitting the removal of Hampton Dellinger as head of the Office of Special Counsel came four days after a federal district court judge ruled that President Donald Trump's attempt to boot Dellinger was \"unlawful, and as the special counsel opposes the terminations of probationary employees throughout the government by the Trump administration.\n\nHowever, the order by a unanimous three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit left open the question of whether Dellinger will be able to return to his position pending the outcome of the Trump administration's appeal in the case.\n\nThe panel, which said it would issue an opinion explaining its order \"in due course,\" also expedited the case, setting a briefing schedule that will end April 11.\n\n\"The Clerk is directed to calendar this case for oral argument this term on the first appropriate date following the completion of briefing,\" the panel wrote.\n\nSince being filed by Dellinger, the case has already landed in the lap of the Supreme Court once, albeit briefly. And the high court is likely to have the final say on whether Trump has the power to dismiss the special counsel.\n\nCNBC has requested comment from Dellinger and his attorneys.\n\nDellinger, who had a five-year term, was appointed as special counsel in March 2024 by then-President Joe Biden, and later confirmed by the Senate.\n\nTrump fired Dellinger by email last month as part of a wide-ranging effort to reduce the number of federal workers.\n\nDellinger's office is responsible for protecting federal employees who act as whistleblowers about illegal or unethical conduct.\n\nDellinger sued the Trump administration in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., over his termination.\n\nHe argued his dismissal was illegal because of a federal law that says special counsels can only be removed by the president \"for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance of office.\"\n\nDistrict Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson on Feb. 10 issued an order barring Dellinger's removal as the case continued.\n\nThe Trump administration then appealed to the Court of Appeals, which in a 2-1 ruling declined to overturn Berman's order.\n\nThe Department of Justice then asked the Supreme Court to rule that Trump had the power to fire Dellinger. But the Supreme Court declined to do so, for now, letting the case wind its way through lower federal courts.\n\nBerman then ruled on Saturday that Trump's firing was unlawful.\n\n\"The Special Counsel's job is to look into and expose unethical or unlawful practices directed at federal civil servants, and to help ensure that whistleblowers who disclose fraud, waste, and abuse on the part of government agencies can do so without suffering reprisals,\" Jackson wrote in her ruling.\n\n\"It would be ironic, to say the least, and inimical to the ends furthered by the statute if the Special Counsel himself could be chilled in his work by fear of arbitrary or partisan removal,\" Jackson wrote.\n\nThe DOJ immediately asked the Court of Appeals in an emergency motion to stay Jackson's ruling pending the outcome of its appeal of that decision.\n\nIn its order Wednesday, the three judges on the appeals court panel said the Trump administration had \"satisfied the stringent requirements for a stay pending appeal.\"\n\n\"This order gives effect to the removal of appellee [Dellinger] from his position as Special Counsel of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel,\" the order noted.\n\nIn the weeks since Trump first tried to fire Dellinger, the special counsel had opposed the president's efforts to fire probationary employees across several federal agencies.",

        "full_text": "Washington — House Republicans are pursuing a stopgap measure to keep the government funded through September, looking to shore up support for the continuing resolution with less than 10 days to prevent a government shutdown.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson has outlined plans for the measure, which is expected to extend funding at current levels through the end of the fiscal year, Sept. 30, and has the backing of President Trump.\n\n\"Conservatives will love this Bill,\" Mr. Trump said Wednesday on social media, calling the continuing resolution \"very important.\"\n\n\"Let's get this Bill done!\" Mr. Trump added.\n\nBut Republicans are facing pressure to do so without support from Democrats. And whether Johnson can get the measure through the House, with a razor-thin Republican majority, remains to be seen.\n\nMembers of the House Freedom Caucus, who often oppose the temporary funding measures, met with the president at the White House Wednesday as Republicans move forward with the funding plan, which could be voted on early next week. After the meeting, Rep. Lauren Boebert said they're ready to move forward with a continuing resolution, called a CR for short, so that the president's agenda can move forward. But other caucus members said they need to see the text first.\n\n\"Look, we haven't seen the final form of the CR,\" said Rep. Andy Harris. \"In concept, the president has said he needs this for his agenda. We support the president's agenda.\"\n\nJohnson told reporters Tuesday that he's hoping to release the text of the continuing resolution by the end of the week.\n\nIn recent years, funding the government has created a headache for Johnson and his predecessor, former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, because of the narrow GOP majority in the House and opposition to temporary funding measures by a group of conservative hardliners. The dynamic has repeatedly forced Republicans to rely on Democrats to keep the government funded, fueling frustration among members of the House GOP ranks.\n\nBut Democrats, now in the minority in both chambers and with few opportunities for leverage, are in a different position. As the Trump administration works to dramatically and quickly downsize large swaths of the executive branch, Democrats have been seeking guardrails on Mr. Trump's ability to withhold funding approved by Congress and are intent on including language in the funding measure. Without the guardrails, Democrats argue that the stopgap measure would give the administration more opportunities to cut federal programs.\n\nJohnson told reporters Tuesday that he thinks what Democrats are requesting is \"unconstitutional,\" saying \"this should be a conversation about numbers, and not about limiting the other branch of government.\"\n\nWithout support from Democrats, House Republicans must keep their conference in line to approve the stopgap measure. Johnson has touted the approach in recent days, which he billed as one that would keep the government open while House Republicans work to incorporate savings from the DOGE effort and revenue brought in by Trump administration policies. He noted on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" Sunday that the DOGE cuts wouldn't be included in the forthcoming continuing resolution, while promising a \"very different process\" on next year's funding.\n\nDuring the last funding fight in December, Johnson pushed for an extension until March to set Republicans up to reach an agreement on new spending bills with a GOP trifecta in Washington. And he noted at the time that House Republicans were aiming to resolve the government funding fight earlier in the year, before the March 14 deadline. But the existing dynamics have persisted, even with Republican majorities in both chambers.\n\nAmid the standoff and approaching deadline, Republicans and Democrats have begun blaming each other. While Republicans say Democrats are flirting with a shutdown with their demands, Democrats argue that the GOP majorities would be responsible for any possible shutdown, and they claim Republicans have left the negotiating table.\n\nSen. Patty Murray, the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, said Tuesday that she's urging Republican leadership to work on new, full-year funding bills and prevent a shutdown with a shorter continuing resolution. She stressed that Democrats \"cannot stand by and accept\" what she called a \"power grab CR that would help Elon take a chainsaw to programs that families rely on.\"\n\n\"I'm ready to pass a short-term CR immediately to take down the risk of a shutdown so that we can finish our negotiations and write our full-year spending bills, which is our job to do,\" Murray added.\n\nEven if House Republicans can approve the six-month funding measure along party lines, a 60-vote threshold in the Senate means the measure would require the backing of at least seven Democrats to be approved in the upper chamber. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, however, who has said \"Republicans are responsible for funding the government,\" called for collaboration on a solution.\n\n\"We believe, we've always believed, the only solution is a bipartisan solution,\" Schumer said.\n\n, and contributed to this report.",

        "full_text": "A terrorist from the Islamic State – Khorasan Province (ISIS-K), who was extradited to the United States in the early Wednesday morning hours, confessed to the FBI that he played key roles in the infamous bombing of Abbey Gate at the Kabul, Afghanistan airport that took the lives of soldiers and civilians, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. He also claimed taking part in a deadly attack on a concert hall in Moscow, and a blast targeting Canadian embassy security guards in Kabul.\n\nMohammad Sharifullah's capture in a joint raid between Pakistani intelligence and the Central Intelligence Agency was announced by President Donald Trump at a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night, revealing that the U.S. had captured Sharifullah, also known as “Jafar.” Trump also told the nation that Sharifullah is believed to be one of the ISIS-K terrorists responsible for the August 2021 Abbey Gate terrorist attack that killed 13 American troops during the bungled withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nJafar landed in U.S. custody at Washington Dulles International Airport and has an initial court appearance Wednesday in Alexandria, Virginia. New FBI court documents shed further light on the slew of attacks in which Sharifullah has claimed a role.\n\nSharifullah was read his \"Miranda rights\" by the FBI and he proceeded to tell them he was recruited into ISIS-K around 2016. The FBI said the terrorist was imprisoned in Afghanistan from approximately 2019 until two weeks before the Kabul airport attack. An ISIS-K suicide bomber named Abdul Rahman al-Logari — who had been freed by the Taliban from a prison at Bagram Air Base in mid-August 2021, mere weeks after the U.S. abandoned the base — has been identified as having carried out the suicide attack at Abbey Gate. The FBI said Sharifullah recognized Logari as an ISIS-K operative he had known while in prison.\n\nLead-up to the Kabul airport attack\n\nThe FBI said Sharifullah was contacted by another ISIS-K member upon being freed from prison in mid-August 2021 who linked Sharifullah up with the ISIS-K plot to attack U.S. forces at Hamid Karzai International Airport. The bureau said ISIS-K members provided Sharifullah with a motorcycle, funds for a cell phone, and instructions on using social media to communicate with them in the lead-up to the attack.\n\nSharifullah said he “was tasked with scouting a route near HKIA for an attacker,” the FBI said, and Sharifullah “conducted surveillance on a route, specifically checking for law enforcement and American or Taliban checkpoints.” The terrorist told his ISIS-K associates that the route seemed clear and that he didn’t believe Logari would be detected when approaching HKIA.\n\nThe Abbey Gate attack killed eleven Marines, one Army soldier, one Navy corpsman, and an estimated 170 Afghan civilians, while wounding dozens of other U.S. troops and scores of Afghans in the crowd, on August 26, 2021.\n\nPatel: \"The FBI will never forget\"\n\nGold Star family members of the fallen U.S. soldiers pleaded with the Biden administration for more answers about the attack, Fox News reported, including during a roundtable before the House Foreign Affairs Committee in 2023, where the Biden White House sought to place the blame for the debacle on the first Trump Administration.\n\nEarlier this year, the family members condemned the Biden administration for doing \"nothing but attempt to take victory laps and thumb their noses at the sacrifice our children made on that fateful day,\" and the families called upon the Trump administration to pursue answers. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said last week that \"we’re taking a very different view obviously than the previous [Biden] administration — and there will be full accountability.\"\n\nSharifullah has been charged with providing material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization resulting in death, and he faces a potential life sentence. FBI Director Kash Patel vowed that “the FBI will never forget the loss of these American heroes, we will continue to hunt down those who viciously murdered our warriors, we will find all responsible and bring them to justice.” Attorney General Pam Bondi said that “under President Trump’s strong leadership on the world stage, this Department of Justice will ensure that terrorists like Mohammad Sharifullah have no safe haven.”\n\nAnd CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Wednesday that “my second day on the job, I spoke with the head of Pakistani intelligence. I shared with him intelligence we had indicating that Jafar was located in the Afghan-Pakistan border region.”\n\nThen-President Joe Biden announced the unconditional withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in an April 2021 speech, setting the withdrawal deadline for the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attack. The Taliban conducted a rapid takeover of the country in the ensuing months and swept into the Afghan capital of Kabul on August 15, 2021. The chaotic and deadly non-combatant evacuation operation by the U.S. was conducted while the U.S. military relied upon a hostile Taliban to provide security outside the airport.\n\nTrump said Tuesday that \"we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity, and he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice.\"\n\nThe \"fake mastermind\"\n\nSarah Adams, a writer and an alum of the CIA who has investigated the Abbey Gate attack, argued on X that Trump was being misled and that Sharifullah was a “fake mastermind.” She contended that the Abbey Gate attack instead “had two joint Masterminds” neither of which were Sharifullah. She said that Sirajuddin Haqqani, the current Taliban interior minister and the leader of the terrorist Haqqani Network, and Sanaullah Ghafari, believed to be a former mid-level Haqqani commander and the current leader of ISIS-K were the \"real\" masterminds.\n\nMastermind or not, the FBI said Sharifullah further confessed to playing a role in the March 2024 attack by ISIS-K against the Crocus City Hall near Moscow, Russia, which killed approximately 130 people. The Biden State Department said it had collected intelligence indicating that ISIS-K was planning an attack in Moscow and contended that it had warned the Kremlin about it.\n\nSharifullah said he received an order from an ISIS-K senior leader to teach would-be attackers in Moscow on how to use AK-style rifles. He added that he later recognized two of perpetrators as men to whom he had provided the online firearms training.\n\nDeath at the Canadian embassy\n\nThe FBI said Sharifullah also confessed to a role in facilitating a June 2016 suicide bombing attack which intended to target U.S. Embassy personnel in Kabul but which actually killed more than ten guards tasked with protecting the Canadian embassy. Sharifullah said he conducted surveillance ahead of that attack and transported the bomber, who he said was named \"Irfan,\" to the site of the attack.\n\nAt the time, that suicide bomber was widely reported to have been part of the Taliban, and the Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid had even touted the deadly bombing on then-Twitter, saying it was carried out “against the forces of aggression” in Afghanistan.\n\nThe UN sanctions monitoring team said in a May 2020 report published by Security Council Report that some of the attacks claimed by ISIS-K may have arisen via “tactical accommodation” with the Haqqani Network. The UN team also said that some countries noted that most ISIS-K attacks include “involvement, facilitation, or the provision of technical assistance” by the Haqqani Network. The UN team also said it had “viewed communication intercepts in the wake of attacks that were claimed by ISIS-K that were traceable to known members of the Haqqani Network.”\n\nOne UN member state said in June 2021 that Ghafari’s ongoing relationship with the Haqqanis provided ISIS-K with “key expertise and access to [attack] networks.” The UN team said that some attacks by ISIS-K may have been “joint ventures” with the Haqqanis.\n\nNeither the FBI nor any of the involved governmental agencies have been able to fully answer the many unanswered questions raised by lawmakers about the attacks and withdrawal, but Sharifullah may very well provide answers — if they can be relied upon — as his case moves through the judicial system.",

FEMA claimed it rescinded the funds over concerns a violent gang had taken over a city shelter.\n\nFEMA approved and awarded the funds during the final months of President Joe Biden’s administration but didn’t disburse them until after Trump took office, the city said.\n\nCity lawyers argued the Trump administration’s gang concerns were a “hastily-constructed facade” and that its real goal was to thwart implementation of the congressionally-authorized shelter funding program.\n\n“Defendants’ money-grab — after FEMA review, approval, and actual payment, without notice or process of any kind — was, simply put, lawless,” the city argued in its lawsuit.\n\nAttorney Emily Hall, representing the US Government, told the judge during an hour of oral arguments on Wednesday that the money would be available once the lawsuit is fully adjudicated, unless Congress revokes it.\n\nJoshua Rubin, a lawyer for the city, told Rearden that it came as “a real shock to us” when the money was taken back.\n\nHe said the money was provided to house individuals who FEMA had decided could be in the country.\n\nRubin said he knew it was an “extraordinary request at the outset of the case” to ask that the funds be immediately restored, “but these are extraordinary circumstances.” He said it was unconstitutional that the money was taken back when Congress had appropriated it.\n\nThe judge, though, said in an oral ruling that the city had cited “no irreparable harm to warrant extraordinary relief.”",

        "full_text": "In an unprecedented move to funnel more public tax dollars toward groups that oppose abortion, Republican lawmakers in Missouri are advancing a plan to allow residents to donate to pregnancy resource centers instead of paying any state income taxes.\n\nThe proposal would establish a 100% tax credit, up from 70%, and a $50,000 annual cap per taxpayer. The result: Nearly all Missouri households — except those with the highest incomes — could fully satisfy their state tax bill by redirecting their payment from the state to pregnancy centers.\n\nThe move comes four months after Missouri voters reversed one of the nation’s strictest abortion bans, and just as clinics have begun performing the procedure again after overcoming Republican obstacles.\n\nSupporters of the bill, which last month cleared a key legislative hurdle in the state House, say it gives taxpayers more control over where their tax dollars go and allows them to support organizations that help pregnant women and provide alternatives to abortion. Alissa Gross, CEO of Resource Health Services, which runs four pregnancy resource centers in the Kansas City area, told the committee in written testimony that tax credits have led to a surge in donations to her organization and that a 100% tax credit could bring in even more.\n\n“Our ability to impact more men and women for life as well as build healthy families has been substantial,” she said.\n\nCritics argue the state’s support for pregnancy resource centers, also known as crisis pregnancy centers, diverts tax revenue away from essential services such as health care and public education and becomes a funding stream for anti-abortion advocacy. They say many centers do little to actually help women; instead, they say they merely discourage women from getting abortions.\n\n“A 70 percent tax credit with no cap was excessive. A 100 percent tax credit is absurd,” Katie Baylie, a lawyer and reproductive rights advocate based in the Kansas City area, wrote in testimony submitted to the committee. “It is an insult to Missourians that our lawmakers are spending time even considering this bill.”\n\nExperts in tax policy and philanthropy said a dollar-for-dollar tax credit — for any purpose — is rare and could be much costlier for the state than intended, especially if pregnancy centers actively promote it.\n\nThere is a big psychological difference for donors between a 100% tax credit and a 70% credit, the experts said. At 70%, donors still have to pay some taxes, but at 100%, there is no reason to make a donation less than their tax liability.\n\n“I could imagine a possibility where there’s a big publicity campaign by these centers, or a viral campaign, and massive numbers of conservative Missourians decide to effectively defund state government in favor of these pregnancy resource centers,” said David Gamage, a professor of tax law and policy at the University of Missouri law school.\n\nHowever, expansion of tax credits clashes with another Republican push to eliminate Missouri’s income tax altogether. Two proposals to replace it with a higher sales tax recently advanced in the state Senate, although it was unclear whether they could pass. If Missouri were to abolish state income taxes, tax credits would become meaningless.\n\nThe bill represents one more expansion of a measure Missouri lawmakers have been growing for several years. Until 2021, Missouri taxpayers who donated to pregnancy resource centers were able to claim a 50% tax credit for their donations, meaning for every $1,000 in donations, a taxpayer’s bill dropped by $500. That’s when an expansion approved by the legislature in 2019 took effect and raised the rate to 70%. That shifted more of the cost of those contributions to the state, since tax credits work by directly reducing the amount of money a taxpayer owes to the state. Unlike deductions, which lower taxable income, tax credits are a dollar-for-dollar reduction in tax liability. When these credits are redeemed, they prevent the state from collecting that revenue, effectively reducing the total income available for public services.\n\nThe legislature also removed a $3.5 million-per-year cap on the program and removed its expiration date.\n\nAt the time, the change drew little attention because it was tucked into the same legislation that created Missouri’s trigger law to ban abortion if Roe v. Wade were overturned — a move that dominated headlines. And there were few warnings about how much it could cost.\n\nThe bill’s official cost estimate, prepared by nonpartisan legislative oversight staff, projected only a modest increase in taxpayer expense. Raising the tax credit to 70% was expected to increase annual tax credits from $3.5 million to $4.9 million. That estimate assumed donations would remain steady.\n\nBut they didn’t. The program has grown significantly, with $11.8 million in tax credits authorized in the past year alone. Still, it remains a small fraction of Missouri’s overall budget; Gov. Mike Kehoe has proposed a $54 billion spending plan for next year.\n\nOnce again, legislative research is downplaying the potential impact on Missouri’s budget. The fiscal note for the bill accounts only for the jump from a 70% to a 100% tax credit, without considering the likely surge in donations that such an incentive would trigger — even though increasing giving is the entire point of the policy.\n\nThe note says that it was “unclear” whether the enhanced tax credit would encourage more people to contribute and claim the credit, which would lead to more foregone tax revenue for the state.\n\nThe legislative research staffer who authored the impact statement declined to comment, and the bill’s House sponsor, Rep. Christopher Warwick, did not respond to questions from ProPublica.\n\nWarwick, a Republican from Bolivar, in southwest Missouri, told the tax reform committee that his proposal empowers taxpayers to support important work without the state “trying to verify what programs work.” He said, too, that he would oppose requirements for pregnancy resource centers to report how they spend the money, saying he wanted to “limit the bureaucracy.”\n\nWarwick’s bill would also increase the tax credit for donations to maternity homes from 70% to 100% and for diaper banks from 50% to 100%. The state has not yet studied the impact of those changes.\n\nA matching bill has been introduced in the Senate but has not yet advanced.\n\nRep. Steve Butz, a Democrat from St. Louis, argued the tax credit would effectively shift charitable giving from individuals to the state.\n\n“This will be the fourth bill I’ve heard that will reduce revenue, which I guess is clearly your goal here — to reduce the revenue to the state,” Butz told Warwick during a legislative hearing on the bill. He argued that if donors receive a full tax credit for their contributions, they aren’t really giving their own money — rather, the state is effectively making the donation for them. “So I don’t know that I’d consider that much charitable giving.”\n\nIn an interview, Butz said he considers himself pro-life and has donated to pregnancy resource centers, receiving the 70% tax credit. However, he said he does not believe the program should take priority over others that receive less or no tax incentives for giving.\n\nMissouri’s approach to crisis pregnancy centers reflects a growing divide between red and blue states. While Republican-led states such as Florida, Texas and Tennessee have ramped up funding for pregnancy resource centers, states led by Democrats, including Massachusetts and California, have warned residents the centers mislead patients by posing as medical clinics while steering them away from abortion.\n\nMissouri is among the national leaders in per capita spending on pregnancy resource centers even before tax credits are factored in, according to data from states that fund them. Kehoe has proposed increasing direct state funding by almost 50% to more than $12 million in the fiscal year that starts July 1.\n\nIn a statement, Gabby Picard, communications director in Kehoe’s office, said the governor “is committed to supporting services that help women choose to carry their unborn child to term, which is why his budget recommends increased funding” for abortion alternatives, including pregnancy resource centers.\n\nMissouri was the first state to use tax credits to fund pregnancy centers, becoming a model for other states looking to support the anti-abortion movement. One public health expert who has tracked the impact of pregnancy centers said Missouri has been a leader and innovator in this effort. “What Missouri is proposing really makes them an outlier at the top of the game,” said Andrea Swartzendruber, an associate professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Georgia.\n\nWarwick’s initiative follows sweeping changes to Missouri’s abortion laws.\n\nIn November, voters approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to abortion and other reproductive health decisions, effectively nullifying a near-total ban that had been in place since 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe first abortion performed under the new amendment took place in Kansas City on Feb. 15, after a judge struck down restrictive licensing rules that had prevented providers like Planned Parenthood from resuming services in the state.\n\nIn response, Republican lawmakers have introduced a wave of bills aimed at limiting the amendment’s impact. Among the measures is another proposed constitutional amendment that would restrict abortion and ban gender-affirming care for minors — an effort to combine something that voters support with something they don’t in the hopes it’ll turn off abortion-rights supporters.\n\nSome abortion-rights advocates in the legislature see the expanded tax credit as part of a broader push by anti-abortion lawmakers stung by the repeal of the abortion ban. After the amendment passed, those legislators “needed some wins,” said Rep. Kemp Strickler, a Democrat from the Kansas City suburbs.\n\n“But even if the amendment had lost,” Strickler said, “they probably would have been coming forward with these kinds of things.”",

        "full_text": "Er ... what? Whatever happened to \"we don't negotiate with terrorists\"?\n\nCheck that -- we've been negotiating with terrorists since the early 1980s in Lebanon. But this doesn't make a lot of sense even apart from that, if Axios' Barak Ravid has it correct, and he's usually reliable. At the same time that Donald Trump argues to flatten Gaza and eject every resident within it, he has also authorized direct talks with Hamas to end the war and return the hostages -- at least nominally cutting Israel out of the process:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Trump administration has been holding direct talks with Hamas over the release of U.S. hostages held in Gaza and the possibility of a broader deal to end the war, two sources with direct knowledge of the discussions tell Axios.\n\nWhy it matters: The talks — held by U.S. presidential envoy for hostage affairs Adam Boehler — are unprecedented. The U.S. had never before engaged directly with Hamas, which it designated a terrorist organization in 1997.\n\nBoehler has a broad range as part of that portfolio, and for obvious reasons. \"Hostage affairs\" will inevitably require some contact with non-state actors, especially in that part of the world. However, contact with Hamas is particularly toxic in the political sense and has been ever since Rob Malley got exposed for engaging Hamas prior to coming aboard Barack Obama's first presidential campaign. Given Trump's hawkish approach to the Gaza war up to now, it doesn't make a lot of sense in the first-blush sense.\n\nPerhaps Trump is playing for effect? A little 3D chess in the Middle East for the sake of our Abraham Accord partners? If so, maybe the purpose is to get Hamas to reject an offer direct from the Americans about the American hostage they hold:\n\nZoom in: The talks have focused in part on the release of U.S. hostages, which is within Boehler's remit as hostage envoy.\n\nBut they have also included discussions of a broader deal to release all remaining hostages and reach a long-term truce, the sources say. No deal has yet been reached.\n\nNo deal will ever be reached, because there is no deal to be had for a lasting peace with Hamas. They are not interested in lasting peace. They want to annihilate Israel, and will only offer taqqiya in the short term while plotting annihilation at the next possible opportunity. In the meantime, they use these kinds of diplomatic initiatives to split Israel from its allies in the West and stall for time. They know how to play 3D chess too:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHamas has been stalling for four days to prevent Israel from pushing it to extend a hostage deal. The initial phase of the ceasefire and hostage deal began in mid-January, a day before the inauguration of US President Donald Trump. That deal was successful and saw hostages released by Hamas. However, the deal ended on March 1, and since then, Hamas has demanded that Israel move to phase 2 of the ceasefire deal.\n\nIsrael’s leaders have opposed phase 2 since the ceasefire began. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other officials have rejected the idea of ending the war and leaving the Philadelphi corridor in southern Gaza. However, Israeli officials also are unclear on when and if they will return to fighting in Gaza. Hamas now believes its long-term strategy has been successful.\n\nHamas believes that it can stall for long enough and call Israel’s bluff about having the “gates of hell” open if Hamas doesn’t buckle. Hamas also believes the Trump administration will not let “hell break loose” in Gaza. Why is Hamas so optimistic? It believes that Israel doesn’t really want to return to fighting. It knows the Trump administration has told Israel that Jerusalem can do whatever it wants.\n\nIf they have direct contact with the Trump administration, they will interpret that as weakness rather than resolve. And in fact, it looks as though Hamas has already taken that message:\n\nHamas believes it will be able to keep long-term control of Gaza. It says it won’t hand over its weapons or give in to a new Egyptian-led proposal for Gaza. It also rejects Trump's idea of re-settling Gaza. Hamas believes Israel is bluffing about returning to war. It also knows that Israel doesn’t want the Palestinian Authority to run Gaza. Hamas knows that if there is a vacuum in Gaza, it will fill it as it has done for the last decades. ...\n\nWhy is Hamas not being flexible? It doesn’t feel pressured.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf they are engaging with the US side directly, no wonder.\n\nOn the other hand, Trump just told Egypt to pound sand on their Gaza-reset plan:\n\nThe White House has rejected an Arab plan for rebuilding the Gaza Strip, an early indication of the strength of President Trump’s commitment to positions he has staked out on contentious foreign-policy issues.\n\nArab governments have scrambled to come up with a plan after Trump laid out a proposal for the U.S. to take over the territory and redevelop it as an international destination after clearing out its Palestinian residents. The Arab proposal nodded to the president’s vision of a “Riviera of the Middle East,” calling for the eventual development of beachfront resorts.\n\nBut the White House shot down the proposal, saying the extent of the destruction in Gaza made keeping Palestinians in the enclave unworkable. Critics of the plan also said it failed to spell out how it would disarm Hamas, the U.S.-designated terrorist group that led the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks on Israel that left 1,200 dead and triggered the war.\n\nThe rejection makes clear that Trump won’t easily give up on an idea that has been criticized by governments around the world and surprised some of his aides and own party. It is also a sign of the challenges facing countries from Canada to Ukraine in trying to steer Trump to more palatable outcomes in disputes of their own.\n\nWhat sense can be made of this? The most cynical take is that Trump wants to take credit for ending wars, even if the wars actually don't end. That was the sotto voce message from Volodymyr Zelensky last week, for which he's now apologizing: Trump was only buying a cessation, after which the West would lose interest. Getting Hamas to release the rest of the hostages in exchange for a return to the status quo would certainly fit that assessment, especially when it comes to Hamas, which has violated every cease-fire it has ever signed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe more generous theory: Trump is offering a Godfather move, essentially making Hamas an offer it can't refuse -- in the hopes that it will. In the movies and the book, the line \"I'll make him an offer he can't refuse\" was a signal that all hell would break loose otherwise. If Hamas remains intransigent, Trump can then say, \"We tried, and now all hell will break loose.\" That would certainly accelerate matters towards his own Gaza reclamation plan and mark an end to the Doha Billionaire Boys Club that Obama allowed in his second term.\n\nWhich is it? It's hard to tell, perhaps by design. The fact that it's leaked out leads me to lean toward the more generous theory, as does Trump's flat rejection of the Egyptian plan. But even if that's the intent, getting on the dance floor to do the Hamas Hokey Pokey rarely works out well for anyone, and it encourages other groups to hike pressure for that level of engagement down the road. \"We don't negotiate with terrorists\" is still the best policy, even if no one's following it these days.\n\nUpdate: This suggests that the more generous theory was the correct choice:\n\n“Shalom Hamas” means Hello and Goodbye - You can choose. Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you. Only sick and twisted people keep bodies, and you are sick and twisted! I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job, not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don’t do as I say. I have just met with your former Hostages whose lives you have destroyed. This is your last warning! For the leadership, now is the time to leave Gaza, while you still have a chance. Also, to the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD! Make a SMART decision. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW, OR THERE WILL BE HELL TO PAY LATER!\n\nDONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds like the gloves may be coming off. Let's see if Hamas tries a little more Hokey Pokey.\n\nUpdate: I overlooked one other ultimatum -- that Hamas 'leadership' leave Gaza. Perhaps the rank and file terrorists will capitulate if the remaining leadership decides to go into exile, but it seems more likely that they would seize power themselves ... or get fragged by civilians who may want a future without Iran's proxy army as their tyrant overlords.\n\nUpdate: An important point from Duane:\n\nTrue enough. Either Hamas has to act, or Trump has to act now. His previous red line was given before he took office, so he had a small out if he wanted to use it. Not this time.",

        "full_text": "(NewsNation) — The mayors of four sanctuary cities appearing before the Republican-led Committee On Oversight and Government Reform on Wednesday could be risking the loss of billions in federal funding for what GOP leaders refer to as a lack of cooperation with federal immigration enforcement efforts.\n\nThe committee’s chairman, U.S. Rep. James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, maintained state and local governments that refuse to comply with immigration enforcement “should not receive a penny of federal funding.”\n\nThe threat to withhold funding from cities like Chicago, Denver, New York and Boston, the four cities whose mayors are appearing before the committee, has also been floated by President Donald Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan.\n\nHoman said the lack of cooperation puts Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at risk and puts local neighborhoods in those cities in danger.\n\n“Sanctuary cities want to keep locking us out of jails, (and) they force us into neighborhoods to find the bad guys,” Homan told reporters Tuesday. “Many times, they’re with others, others who aren’t a criminal priority but are in the country illegally; they’re coming too.”\n\nHow sanctuary cities could lose funding\n\nThe federal scrutiny of sanctuary cities has put Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, Denver Mayor Mike Johnston, New York Mayor Eric Adams and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu in the crosshairs.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has already sued the state of New York and the city of Chicago, alleging that the cities have obstructed the federal government from enforcing immigration laws. Shortly after Trump took office, the Department of Justice directed federal prosecutors to investigate whether local officials should face legal action for resisting federal immigration laws.\n\nBesides the two lawsuits, Bondi issued a memo in early February stating that sanctuary jurisdictions will not have access to federal funds from the DOJ.\n\nIn addition, Bondi stated that the DOJ would pause the distribution of all funds until a review could be completed and would terminate all agreements that violate the law.\n\nThe memo said sanctuary jurisdictions should not have access to DOJ federal grants. The memo also threatened to pause funding to nongovernmental organizations that “support and provide services to removable or illegal aliens.”\n\nAccording to the Center for Immigration Studies, the Department of Justice provided $1.56 billion in funding to sanctuary cities.\n\nChicago’s Johnson said having federal funding pulled would “undermine all of the investments we have made thus far.” He said that the city has spent more than $20 billion in new investments that contribute to the overall safety of Chicago.\n\nDenver’s mayor said that losing federal funding would “dramatically weaken public safety” and added it would keep the city from repairing broken-down bridges, enrolling kids in pre-school and providing medical care to veterans.\n\nIn addition, Trump’s transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, has threatened to move federal funding away from sanctuary cities. That could mean billions of dollars that could be withheld from those cities and states that have sanctuary policies in place that prohibit local police and law enforcement agencies from assisting with federal immigration enforcement.\n\nThe New York Times reported that the DOT sends billions of dollars to states and local governments each year for the funding of highways, public transit systems, airports, bridges and other projects.\n\nDespite the threats to strip sanctuary cities of federal funding, NewsNation political contributor Christopher Hahn said any funding withholding will likely lead to a lengthy legal battle that could reach the U.S. Supreme Court. Homan said that the disbursement of federal funding cannot be dependent on which political party is occupying the White House without Congress acting.\n\nHahn said before the hearing the four mayors should be ready to walk into what is expected to be a “very hostile” environment and defend the work their cities have done with the migrant community. He said that in each case, the mayors in each of the cities have committed to helping federal immigration officials deport dangerous criminals.\n\nBut rather than focus on what these cities are doing, Hahn said Republicans are focused on the “show business” aspect of Homan’s mass deportation efforts. He said it’s up to the mayors on Wednesday to ignore the hostility and stick to their gameplan of defending their cities.\n\n“(Republicans) have these ideas, and what’s happening is that their ideas are actually hurting the average American,” Hahn said. “Forget the immigrants. The average American is going to start to see increased prices on a lot of things and immigration is part of that.”\n\nFederal focus remains on sanctuary cities\n\nIn announcing Wednesday’s hearing with the four mayors, the Committee On Oversight and Government Reform included a nearly three-minute video on social media, targeting the four cities.\n\nIn a statement, Comer referred to those mayors as “pro-illegal alien mayors” and said all four have “implemented reckless, illegal policies that shield criminal aliens from federal immigration enforcement and endanger public safety.”\n\nIn response, Wu called the video “pretty dramatic” and said the video was “amusing to see so much effort going into hyping up the hearing. There are important topics we need to talk about.”\n\nOf the four mayors, only Adams has said that he would show cooperation with ICE and has signed an executive order allowing ICE agents to work on Rikers Island to help identify violent migrant criminals.\n\nIn announcing Wednesday’s hearing last month, Comer said that “President Trump and his administration are rightfully taking action against sanctuary cities.”\n\nComer previously said that “sanctuary mayors owe the American people an explanation for city policies that jeopardize public safety and violate federal immigration law” by releasing dangerous criminals into the streets.\n\nHoman has made previous visits to Chicago and New York, where highly publicized ICE raids took place. He also recently targeted Boston, saying he was “bringing hell with him” as his focus on noncooperative cities continues.\n\nDespite the two filed lawsuits and threats of having federal funding withheld, the mayors who will go before the congressional committee Wednesday remain committed to protecting their respective cities’ sanctuary status.\n\n“We are not going to be intimidated by those acts of terror that radically shift our way of living,” Johnson, Chicago’s mayor, told WTTW News. “That’s what individuals who stoke fear into people want to see happen.”\n\nTrump’s threats to go after officials who do not comply with federal immigration enforcement have also drawn the attention of migrant advocacy groups. Eskinder Negash, the president and CEO of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, said that “punitive measures” like the threats are counterproductive and unjust.\n\n“We should remain committed to advocating for policies that prioritize compassion and the shared prosperities of our communities,” Negash said.",

        "full_text": "After Elizabeth Holmes lost her last-ditch effort to overturn her 2022 fraud conviction by a federal appeals court on Monday, Feb. 24, the former Theranos founder responded to the decision from behind bars.\n\n“I am more determined than ever to fight for my freedom,\" Holmes says, writing via email from a federal prison in Texas. \"And I know that when the truth finally comes out I will be proven innocent.\"\n\nHolmes, who founded the billion-dollar blood testing company at the age of 19 in 2003, was convicted of three counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud over the collapse of her company. She was convicted alongside her former business and romantic partner Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani. The appeal of his conviction, which resulted in a prison sentence of 13 years, was also rejected in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in San Francisco the same day. The two are still ordered to pay $452 million in restitution.\n\nIn the opinion filed in court last week, three judges ruled that the issues Holmes raised about her trial — and the grounds on which she sought her sentence be overturned — were not valid. The ruling bookends a years-long Silicon Valley drama over the blood testing startup that took the industry by storm with Holmes’ appeal and $9 billion Theranos valuation. The company collapsed after its testing technology was exposed as a failure, a scandal that inspired books like journalist John Carreyrou's Bad Blood, the Hulu limited series The Dropout and podcasts.\n\nNow the 41-year-old mother of two small children, wears drab khaki prison garb, with her blonde hair pulled back, bare makeup and a silver cross around her neck— speaking in a voice notably softer than the throaty baritone she was known for.\n\n“I’m not the same person I was back then,” said Holmes in PEOPLE's February 2025 cover story, who pleaded not guilty at her trial and maintains her innocence today, albeit while vaguely acknowledging “there are things I would have done differently” on her path to lockup.\n\n“It’s surreal. People who have never met me believe so strongly about me. They don’t understand who I am. It forces you to spend a lot of time questioning belief and hoping the truth will prevail. I am walking by faith and, ultimately, the truth. But it’s been hell and torture to be here.”\n\nHolmes began serving her 11-year sentence (reduced to nine for good behavior) in May 2023 at Federal Prison Camp Bryan in Bryan, Texas. Her listed release date at the Federal Bureau of Prisons is currently March 19, 2032.\n\nHolmes asked the court to toss out her conviction and grant a new trial, arguing that prosecutors presented key testimony during the four-month trial from Theranos’ final lab director that was “infected with error.”\n\nProsecutors used the lab director, Kingshuk Das, as a scientific expert on Theranos’ blood testing device called the Edison, but Holmes’ attorneys argued that he was never properly vetted by the judge as an expert.\n\nThe Justice Department countered that Das wasn’t providing an expert opinion, but rather testifying about what he saw at the company while he worked there and relayed to his boss Holmes at the time. The judges' opinion held that the former employees spoke from their own experiences, and not as experts.\n\nWhile “some aspects of the testimonies veered into expert territory,” read part of the opinion, “any error was harmless.”\n\nThe judges also dismissed Holmes’ claims that a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services report, which was presented in court during trial, misled the jury. Holmes also claimed the district court violated her rights when they denied her access to cross-examine, but the opinion held that limiting that access was justifiable.\n\nNeama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor and attorney, told PEOPLE this denial likely dooms Holmes's chances of having her conviction reversed.\n\n\"This is likely the end of the road for Holmes. She gets one appeal as of right, and this was it,\" Rahmani said, adding that while there may be options for other appeals, \"only a small percentage\" of those result in even a hearing.\n\nAfter her appeal was denied, prosecutors declined to comment to PEOPLE. Her defense has not responded for comment.\n\nAs for Holmes, she's still processing the downfall that wiped away her entire fortune and she considers her trial and conviction in a San Jose courtroom in 2022 to be a miscarriage of justice.",

FROM SICARIO TO SIN NOMBRE TO THE MARKSMAN, ALL WITH VARYING DEGREES OF REALISM AND ACCURACY, ILLUSTRATING THE LONG RUNNING TENSIONS AT OUR SOUTHERN BORDER.\n\nOF COURSE YOU DON’T HAVE TO LOOK ANY FURTHER THAN TODAY’S HEADLINES FOR THE LATEST ON THIS DECADES OLD ISSUE. BUT NOW, WITH A NEW ADMINISTRATION IN THE WHITE HOUSE, THE POTENTIAL FOR SOMETHING WE’VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE EXISTS; REGULAR AMERICAN TROOPS GOING AFTER MEXICAN CARTELS. AND THAT’S THE SUBJECT OF THIS WEEK’S DEBRIEF.\n\nONE OF THE MANY EXECUTIVE ORDERS SIGNED BY PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP SINCE RETAKING THE OVAL OFFICE CALLED FOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO LABEL MEXICAN DRUG CARTELS AS FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS–FTOs.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT IS MOTIVATED BY THE RISE IN OPIOID AND FENTANYL RELATED DEATHS LARGELY ATTRIBUTED TO THE CARTELS’ SMUGGLING OPERATIONS.\n\nSECRETARY OF STATE MARCO RUBIO DID LABEL 8 MEXICAN CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS–INCLUDING THE TREN DE ARAGUA GANG AND THE SINOLA CARTEL– AS FTOs AFTER THE DEPARTMENT’S BUREAU OF COUNTERTERRORISM SHOWED THE GROUPS WERE ENGAGING IN TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, WHICH ARE DEFINED AS PREMEDITATED, POLITICALLY MOTIVATED VIOLENCE PERPETRATED AGAINST NONCOMBATANT TARGETS BY SUBNATIONAL OR CLANDESTINE GROUPS.\n\nBUT JUST BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES NOW OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZES THE CARTELS AS TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS–DOESN’T MEAN A FULL-SCALE U-S INVASION TO ROOT OUT MEXICAN CARTELS IS GOING TO HAPPEN.\n\n[Jon Molik, Army Intelligence Officer]\n\n“Yeah, I think it was really the message that was most important when it came to targeting or labeling these cartels FTOs.”\n\n[Ryan Robertson]\n\nJON MOLIK IS AN ACTIVE-DUTY U-S INTELLIGENCE OFFICER.\n\n[Jon Molik, Army Intelligence Officer]\n\n“I mean, they’re already targeted with some pretty significant law enforcement authority. The Drug Enforcement Administration works very hard on the border and in other places to curb the drug smuggling from said cartels and Homeland Security Investigations does as well, the FBI. You know, there are already a lot of laws on the books dealing with what are traditionally called transnational criminal organizations, TCOs. And so there’s a bit of an increase in financial authority, financial investigative authority. You can seize some real estate property. can seize financial assets and stuff. And you can break financial transactions between US citizens and those cartels. But there isn’t a huge leap, if you will. It’s more about messaging.”\n\n[Ryan Robertson, host of Weapons and Warfare]\n\n“If we take those gloves off and this becomes a kinetic fight, you know, let’s push things out to the right. What would that look like? Is it SOF units? Is it HIMARS on the Rio Grande? What, what would a kinetic fight with the cartels look like?”\n\n[Jon Molik, Army Intelligence Officer]\n\n“Yeah. So again, assuming the diplomatic efforts fall through and this ends up being something that is kinetic. I would say it’s not the latter, more the former in that being special operations activity, you know, south of the border. if we wanted to get involved in that. But I would say that’s something that already kind of happens in a law enforcement capacity. So I think it would be more of that. it would look a lot like, in my estimation, it would look a lot like what we do with foreign governments across the world that are allies with the United States, and that is training and bolstering and equipping those that are already there. So, and that’s really the ultimate purpose of special operations forces, at least some of the groups, is to train other militaries. That’s what the Green Berets do in particular.”\n\n[Ryan Robertson]\n\nGREEN BERETS LIKE ERIC BROWN–WHO SPENT MORE THAN 20 YEARS WITH THE ARMY’S SPECIAL FORCES.\n\n[Eric Brown, Former Green Beret]\n\n“You don’t wanna solve a problem for another country. You wanna give the resources and capabilities to that country for them to solve that problem.”\n\n[Ryan Robertson]\n\nBROWN SAYS IF THE CARTELS DO FIND THEIR WAY ONTO THE U-S STATE DEPARTMENT’S FTO LIST–THEN NEW POTS OF MONEY ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO CARRYOUT AND EXPAND OPERATIONS.\n\nSO, MORE INTELLIGENCE GATHERING, MORE TRAINING OF LOCAL FORCES, MAYBE SOME ELITE U-S SOLDIERS ON THE GROUND CARRYING-OUT HIGH VALUE MISSIONS. BUT BOTH BROWN AND MOLIK SAY A FULL ON, HEAD-TO-HEAD FIGHT BETWEEN THE CARTELS AND CONVENTIONAL U-S FORCES IS NOT REALISTIC.\n\n[Eric Brown, Former Green Beret]\n\n“I don’t think they have close air support capabilities yet. I don’t think they have F-35s and F-16s and C-130, you know, Spectre gunships, gunships dropping bombs. I could be wrong, but I mean, they do have the ability to do that with drones of dropping ordnance. But yeah, I think it’d be more of a clandestine approach.”\n\n[Ryan Robertson, host of Weapons and Warfare]\n\n“Right? Because pulling in like, you know, those more exquisite assets like a, you know, a ghostrider gunship or something like that, obviously, that would take a lot of coordination with the Mexican government as well. And like you said, the stomach for that. I mean, there could be–that would be a full scale war. There are going to be casualties and you know, impacts of that kind of operation. So, yeah, I think, you know, obviously I’m going to agree with you. You’re the expert, right? I think it probably would be more clandestine type approaches, but walk me through what that would look like. I mean, it’s, you know, special forces going in, teaching native populations, you know, how to, how to conduct warfare, but there’s also probably going to be some smaller squads, you know, doing some ninja type stuff in the middle of the night, right?”\n\n[Eric Brown, Former Green Beret]\n\n“Yeah, I like that analogy. Ninja squads. You better watch out, somebody in the government might take that and name a ninja squad. Yeah, if you’re training, let’s say, an elite force with the Mexican military to go head on and hit those strategic targets. But if you do have, let’s say, what we did in Afghanistan and Iraq, right, was the HVT, a high value target, that you can get permissions and authorities to do a kill-capture mission. That’s when you would bring in the force that does that for the America side, where you gain that intelligence, you infiltrate you know, clandestinely at night or whatever the time that they’re not expecting it and you come off the truck or the air, you know, air platform and you execute a target and then fly back, either killing or capturing. But like you said, you have to have the, you know, that’s when America and Mexico have to high five and, and agree on that because, no one wants our ninjas to come into their country, cause they’re sovereign, right? We wouldn’t want Mexico to have a ninja squad to come into America to execute what they deem a high value target.”\n\n[Ryan Robertson]\n\nAPART FROM NINJA SQUADS CARRYING OUT CLANDESTINE MISSIONS ON HIGH VALUE TARGETS–BROWN SAYS THE U-S COULD DECIDE TO USE DRONES, LIKE AN MQ-9 REAPER–TO TAKE OUT CERTAIN CARTEL MEMBERS–SORT OF LIKE HOW TRUMP ORDERED THE STRIKE ON QASSEM SOLEMIENI–AN IRANIAN TERRORIST LEADER WHO WAS BLOWN UP WHILE IN IRAQ.\n\n[Eric Brown, Former Green Beret]\n\n“When we did that to him, I mean, Iraq got mad, but nothing happened.”\n\n[Ryan Robertson]\n\nWHEN IT COMES TO USING REAPERS TO TAKE OUT DRUG FACTORIES THOUGH, MOLIK SAYS THE JUICE MAY NOT BE WORTH THE SQUEEZE.\n\n[Jon Molik, Army Intelligence Officer]\n\n“In terms of kinetic response; using platforms like the Reaper, which has that capability, that’s all about tactics. What I mean by that is to say, how effective would it be to conduct targeted strikes against, say, drug labs that are being operated within one cartel? It’s likely going to be just as effective as going after IED locations, facilitation locations within Afghanistan. I mean, it would have an immediate impact and then someone’s gonna build a new drug house and it’s gonna move down the road and go somewhere else. So I don’t know if the United States would be interested in getting involved in some whack-a-mole with all of these, yeah, all of these MQ9s in their kinetic capacity. That costs a lot of money and how effective could it really be?”\n\n[Ryan Robertson]\n\nINFILTRATING THE CARTELS AND TAKING OUT THE WHOLE OPERATION SO IT CAN’T RECONSTITUTE WOULD BE ONE WAY OF DEALING WITH THE CARTELS…BUT PROTECTING THE IDENTITIES OF ANY AMERICAN’S INVOLVED IN THOSE OPERATIONS WOULD BE VITAL. BECAUSE UNLIKE FIGHTING THE TALIBAN OR ISIS, THERE IS A REAL RISK OF RETALIATION FROM THE CARTELS AGAINST SOLDIERS’ FAMILIES. THE CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE OBVIOUSLY VERY WELL FUNDED AND OPERATE VAST NETWORKS–SO IF A SOLDIER’S IDENTITY IS DISCOVERED, THE CARTELS ABSOLUTELY HAVE THE MEANS TO ACT ON THAT INFORMATION.\n\nBUT THERE AGAIN, DOING SO MAY ACTUALLY PUT THE CARTELS IN A MORE PRECARIOUS POSITION WITH THE U-S MILITARY THAN THEY ALREADY ARE.\n\n[Jon Molik, Army Intelligence Officer]\n\n“The cartels are a little different than other organizations we’ve dealt with throughout the world. Other organizations are looking at potentially becoming nation states, taking control of land from other areas. And that’s not what the cartels want. The cartels are like gangs and organized crime in the United States. They want to make money. And the only way to make money is if nobody is paying attention to them. And so if they conducted some type of operation so drastic, like killing innocents with RPGs across the border, you’re going to bring the full-fledged might of the United States potentially against your operations. And now you can’t make money.”\n\n[Ryan Robertson]\n\nSO, TO RECAP–WHILE LABELING MEXICAN DRUG CARTELS AS FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS DOES PUT THEM IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS HAMAS, ISIS, AND BOKO HARAM… IT DOESN’T MEAN THE U-S WILL FIGHT THEM THE SAME WAY.\n\nIT DOES MEAN THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE IS PUTTING A LOT MORE SCRUTINY ON THOSE ORGANIZATIONS AND IS WILLING TO PUT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TOWARDS TAKING THEM DOWN.",

        "full_text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is granting a one-month exemption on his stiff new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers, as worries persist that the newly launched trade war could crush domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe pause comes after Trump spoke with leaders of the “big 3” automakers, Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, on Wednesday, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.\n\nAsked if 30 days was enough for the auto sector to prepare for the new taxes, Leavitt said Trump was blunt with the automakers seeking an exemption: “He told them that they should get on it, start investing, start moving, shift production here to the United States of America where they will pay no tariff.”\n\nTrump had long promised to impose tariffs, but his opening weeks in the White House involved aggressive threats and surprise suspensions, leaving allies unclear at what the U.S. president is actually trying to achieve.\n\nBased off various Trump administration statements, the tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China imposed on Tuesday are about stopping illegal immigration, blocking fentanyl smuggling, closing the trade gap, balancing the federal budget and other nations showing more respect for Trump.\n\nAll of that has left Canada, a long-standing ally, determined to stand up against Trump with their own retaliatory tariffs, rejecting a White House overture to possibly reduce some of tariffs imposed on Tuesday.\n\n“We are not going to back down,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford said after speaking with the Canadian prime minister. “We will not budge. Zero tariffs and that is it”\n\nFord told The Associated Press that the auto sector in the United States and Canada would last approximately 10 days before they start shutting down the assembly lines because of the tariffs.\n\n“People are going to lose their jobs,” he said.\n\nAfter the White House announced the one month reprieve, shares of big U.S., Asian and European automakers jumped as much as 6%.\n\nBut pausing the 25% taxes on autos and auto parts traded through the North American trade pact USMCA would only delay a broader reckoning to take place on April 2, when Trump is set to impose broad “reciprocal” tariffs to match the taxes and subsidies that other countries charge on imports.\n\nThe U.S. automaker Ford said in a statement: “We will continue to have a healthy and candid dialogue with the Administration to help achieve a bright future for our industry and U.S. manufacturing.”\n\nGM in a statement thanked Trump “for his approach, which enables American automakers like GM to compete and invest domestically.”\n\nStellantis also thanked Trump for the one-month exemption, saying it “strongly” supported “his determination to enable the American automotive sector to thrive.”\n\nOther industries are also likely to seek exemptions from the import taxes.\n\n“A number of industries have reached out to us to ask us for exemptions to the tariffs,” Vice President JD Vance said Wednesday.\n\nThe White House repeatedly insisted that it would not grant exemptions and the sudden turnaround reflects the economic and political problems being created by Trump’s day-old tariffs. While the Republican president sees them as enriching the United States, his plans to tax imports have alienated allies and caused anxiety about slower economic growth and accelerating inflation.\n\nThe U.S. president engaged in a phone call on Wednesday with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, as U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had suggested that the administration was looking to meet Canada and Mexico “in the middle.”\n\nBut Trudeau refused to lift Canada’s retaliatory tariffs so long as Trump continues with his new taxes on imports from Canada, a senior government official told The Associated Press. The official confirmed the stance on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.\n\n“Both countries will continue to be in contact today,” Trudeau’s office said.\n\nThe prospect of a trade war appears to be an ongoing feature of the Trump administration. In addition to his upcoming reciprocal tariffs that could strike the European Union, India, Brazil, South Korea, Canada and Mexico, Trump wants to tax imports of computer chips, pharmaceutical drugs and autos. He also closed exemptions on his 2018 steel and aluminum tariffs and is investigating tariffs on copper as well.\n\nTariffs are taxes paid by importers in the countries receiving the goods, so the cost could largely be passed along to U.S. consumers and businesses in the form of higher prices. In his Tuesday night speech to a joint session of Congress, Trump tried to minimize the financial pain as a “ little disturbance.”\n\n“It may be a little bit of an adjustment period,” he said after claiming that farmers would benefit from reciprocal tariffs on countries that have tariffs on U.S. exports. “You have to bear with me again and this will be even better.”\n\nTrump has predicted that tariffs will lead to greater investment inside the U.S., creating factory jobs and boosting growth in the long term.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump put 25% taxes on imports from Mexico and Canada, taxing Canadian energy products such as oil and electricity at a lower 10% rate. The president also doubled the 10% tariff he placed on China to 20%.\n\nThe administration has claimed that the tariffs are about stopping the smuggling of drugs such as fentanyl, with aides asserting that this is about a “drug war” rather than a “trade war.” U.S. customs agents seized just 43 pounds (19.5 kilograms) of fentanyl at the northern border the last fiscal year.\n\nTrudeau said on Tuesday that his country would plaster tariffs on over $100 billion (U.S. dollars) of American goods over the course of 21 days, stressing that the United States had abandoned a long-standing friendship.\n\n“Today, the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same time, they are talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying, murderous dictator. Make that make sense,” Trudeau said on Tuesday.\n\nMexico indicated it would announce its own countermeasures on Sunday.\n\nBeijing responded with tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of U.S. farm exports. It also expanded the number of U.S. companies subject to export controls and other restrictions by about two dozen.\n\n“If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end,” China’s embassy to the United States posted on X on Tuesday night.\n\nIn response to China, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends” that the United States is “prepared” for war against the world’s second largest economy.\n\n“Those who long for peace must prepare for war,” Hegseth said Wednesday morning. “If we want to deter war with the Chinese or others, we have to be strong.”\n\nLeavitt is one of three administration officials who face a lawsuit from The Associated Press on First- and Fifth-amendment grounds. The AP says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Alexa St. John in Detroit contributed reporting.

        "full_text": "The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5–4 on March 4 that the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) wastewater discharge permitting system violates federal law.\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett wrote a dissenting opinion that was joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nThe nation’s highest court ruled that the EPA must provide specific effluent limitations to wastewater facilities and the governmental bodies that operate them. Effluent is liquid waste or sewage released into a sea or river.\n\nSan Francisco argued in the appeal that the EPA imposed overly vague limitations on how much pollution may be present in wastewater discharged by water utilities. The city stated that the regulations made it difficult to know if its wastewater systems were in compliance.\n\nThe EPA grants permits to local governments and water management authorities under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) to limit the amount of pollution flowing into bodies of water.\n\nIn court documents, San Francisco stated that the EPA directs cities not to pollute water bodies “too much” but does not provide a specific limitation, and this opens the door to uncertainty and makes it hard to comply.\n\nInstead of telling the city “how much it needs to control its discharges to comply with the Act,” the EPA’s “generic prohibitions leave the City vulnerable to enforcement based on whether the Pacific Ocean meets state-adopted water quality standards,” according to the city.\n\nSan Francisco argued that it was unfair to hold it responsible for polluted Pacific Ocean beaches near the city because the pollution may have come from outside sources.\n\nThe EPA stated that the city’s wastewater system cannot cope with runoff during storms, leading to pollution being released into the ocean.\n\nThe city stated that it was facing potentially billions of dollars in fines for violating its permit.\n\nAfter San Francisco challenged the permit, the EPA’s Environmental Appeals Board rejected the challenge in December 2020.\n\nIn July 2023, a divided U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected San Francisco’s appeal and affirmed the EPA’s power to specify “general narrative prohibitions” on discharges under the Clean Water Act (CWA).\n\nUnder the Clean Water Act, the agency may issue limitations when it is uncertain that the effluent limitations in the permit are adequate to protect water quality, he said.\n\nIn the majority opinion, Alito wrote that “‘end-result’ requirements” in permits “make a permittee responsible for the quality of the water in the body of water into which the permittee discharges pollutants.”\n\n“When a permit contains such requirements, a permittee that punctiliously follows every specific requirement in its permit may nevertheless face crushing penalties if the quality of the water in its receiving waters falls below the applicable standards,” he wrote.\n\nHowever, the effluent-limiting provisions of the Clean Water Act do not allow the EPA “to include ‘end-result’ provisions in NPDES permits.”\n\n“Determining what steps a permittee must take to ensure that water quality standards are met is the EPA’s responsibility, and Congress has given it the tools needed to make that determination. If the EPA does what the CWA demands, water quality will not suffer,” Alito wrote.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the ruling of the Ninth Circuit.\n\nBarrett, who dissented in part, wrote in her opinion that San Francisco’s argument that the EPA lacks statutory authority to impose conditions on the discharge of pollutants into the ocean is “wrong.”\n\nThe Clean Water Act requires the EPA “to impose ‘any more stringent limitation’ that is ‘necessary to meet ... or required to implement any applicable water quality standard.’”\n\n“Conditions that forbid the city to violate water quality standards are plainly ‘limitations’ on the city’s license to discharge,” Barrett wrote.\n\nThe new ruling is the EPA’s fourth loss at the Supreme Court since 2022.",

        "full_text": "While the internet has made accessing information and updates on what is happening in the world extremely easy, it has also facilitated the proliferation of fake news. Over the past decades, fake news has thus become a heated topic of debate, with some social media platforms introducing measures aimed at curbing online misinformation.\n\nResearchers at PSL University and University of Zurich recently set out to investigate people's ability to correctly identify both true and false news, by reviewing previous psychology and behavioral science studies. The findings of their meta-analysis, published in Nature Human Behavior, suggest that most people are good at identifying fake news, while a good portion of people tend to be skeptical of news that is true.\n\n\"In May 2021, Jan Pfänder, who led the study, took a course on meta-analysis and wanted to do a meta-analysis on news judgment,\" Sacha Altay, senior author of the paper, told Medical Xpress.\n\n\"At the time, I found the idea interesting but didn't see much potential. A year later, in light of academic debates about whether skepticism towards true news is a greater issue than gullibility towards false news, I saw an angle: the data Jan started collecting could not only tell us whether people can tell true from false news, but also whether people are more skeptical of true news than they are gullible of false news.\"\n\nWhen Altay and Pfänder first started conducting their meta-analysis, they observed that many past studies gathered evidence suggesting that people are quite good at distinguishing between true and false news, with the rejection of true news being more common than the acceptance of false news. Nonetheless, many academics were not convinced by these findings and public discourse continued to emphasize people's misinformation.\n\n\"We thus decided to systematically investigate these apparent trends to establish whether they are real or not, and whether they could be caused by some methodological artifacts, such as the type of scales used to measure the accuracy of the news or the news selection process itself,\" explained Altay.\n\n\"We conducted a systematic literature review and a pre-registered meta-analysis of all the experiments exposing people to true and false news and asking them to rate the accuracy of the news.\"\n\nAltay and Pfänder reviewed several past studies, which included a total of 194,438 participants based in 40 different countries across six continents. The findings of their meta-analysis appeared to confirm earlier results, suggesting that people are very good at discerning between true and false news.\n\n\"A large majority of people (~80%) can discern true from false news,\" said Altay. \"The implication is that crowdsourced fact-checking initiatives have a lot of potential: we should find ways to harness collective intelligence when it comes to rating the quality of information online.\"\n\nWhile their findings suggest that most people can accurately judge the veracity of news, they also showed that people are slightly better at spotting false news than true news. In other words, most of the people who took part in the studies appeared to be better skilled at rating false news as false than rating true news as true.\n\n\"A small majority of people show this trend (59%),\" said Altay. \"The implication of this finding is that we should focus more on increasing the acceptance of true news. Currently, a lot of efforts are dedicated to making people skeptical of (false) news, however, our data shows that there may be more room to increase the acceptance of true news than to reduce the acceptance of false news.\"\n\nThe recent meta-analysis run by Altay and Pfänder aligns with previous findings, thus suggesting that people are better at identifying false news than public opinion might think. The researchers are now planning to carry out further studies to assess the potential of various strategies for improving people's ability to tell false and true news apart.\n\n\"As part of our future research, we will do another meta-analysis, this time focusing on interventions aimed at improving people's ability to discern true from false news,\" added Altay. \"The goal is to measure how effective they are and under what conditions.\"\n\n© 2025 Science X Network",

        "full_text": "China has set an annual growth target of “about 5 percent”, promising to make domestic demand its main economic driver as an escalating trade war with the United States hit exports.\n\nThe headline growth figure announced by Premier Li Qiang at an annual Communist Party conclave on Wednesday also included a rare rise in fiscal funding, allowing China’s budget deficit to reach 4 percent this year as it battles stuttering employment for young people, low consumer demand and a property sector debt crisis.\n\nUnder the plans, some 12 million new jobs will be created in Chinese cities as Beijing pushes for 2 percent inflation this year.\n\n“Budget deficit ratio from 3 percent to 4 percent doesn’t seem much, but that’s the highest that has been set in three decades. So the government is committing to spending more,” Al Jazeera’s Katrina Yu said, reporting from Beijing.\n\nThe Chinese government also pledged to make domestic demand the “main engine and anchor” of growth, adding that Beijing should “move faster to address inadequate domestic demand, particularly insufficient consumption”.\n\nIn a rare move, Li said China would hike its fiscal deficit by one percentage point, something that analysts have said will give Beijing more latitude to tackle its economic slowdown.\n\nAddressing nearly 3,000 members of the National People’s Congress, Li in his 55-minute talk acknowledged both international and domestic challenges.\n\n“An increasingly complex and severe external environment may exert a greater impact on China in areas such as trade, science, and technology,” the 32-page report said.\n\n“Domestically, the foundation for China’s sustained economic recovery and growth is not strong enough. Effective demand is weak, and consumption, in particular, is sluggish.”\n\nDefence budget hiked\n\nChina also said in a draft budget that defence spending would rise 7.2 percent this year as it rapidly modernises its armed forces in the face of regional tensions and strategic competition with the US.\n\nSince Xi Jinping became president and commander-in-chief more than a decade ago, China’s defence budget has ballooned to 1.78 trillion yuan ($245bn) this year from 720 billion yuan in 2013.\n\n“President Xi Jinping has made it very clear that he wants to modernise China’s military by the year 2035 and a lot of that money will go towards military technology, better missiles, better submarines and missile surveillance technology,” Al Jazeera’s Katrina Yu said.\n\nAt the same time, the Chinese military is trying to improve combat readiness through more rigorous training and drills, according to official reports – many of which involve Taiwan scenarios and territorial claims in the South China Sea.\n\nBeijing considers Taiwan part of its territory, but the Pacific island has had an independent government since 1949. Xi has repeatedly said he does not want to postpone unification indefinitely – and would use force, if necessary.\n\nChina remains the world’s second-largest military spender behind the US, whose proposed military budget for 2025 is $850bn.",

        "full_text": "The Palm Beach Post fired its editorial page editor after the Florida paper ran a cartoon on the war in Gaza that local Jewish groups slammed as antisemitic.\n\nTony Doris, 67, who worked at the Gannett-owned broadsheet for more than 20 years, was let go last month following the backlash.\n\nThe syndicated cartoon ran in January and showed two Israeli soldiers rescuing a hostage held captive by Hamas with the caption: “Some Israeli Hostages Are Home After Over a Year of Merciless War.”\n\nThe soldiers tell the hostage “watch your step” as the three figures walk over a pile of bodies with the label “over 40 thousand Palestinians killed.”\n\nDoris, who is Jewish, claimed the illustration was simply anti-war.\n\n“I fully support Israel’s right to exist,” Doris told Stet News, a nonprofit news group in Palm Beach that earlier reported his firing.\n\n“I think you can feel that way and still be open to discussion of the issue of violence that has taken place there.”\n\nGannett declined to comment on Doris’ ouster.\n\n“The cartoon did not meet our standards,” Lark-Marie Anton, a Palm Beach Post spokesperson, told The Post in a statement. “We sincerely regret the error and have taken appropriate action to prevent this from happening again.”\n\nThe cartoon immediately stirred controversy in the posh community, leading the Jewish Federation of Palm Beach County to buy a full-page ad in the following week’s Sunday Palm Beach Post denouncing the decision.\n\nIn the ad, the nonprofit argued the cartoon trivialized hostages’ suffering and “spread dangerous antisemitic tropes, including the false and inflammatory accusation of bloodlust.”\n\nSenior editors at Gannett took action after the ad ran — suspending Doris and meeting with leaders from the federation, including president and chief executive Michael Hoffman.\n\nDuring the meeting, the Gannett editors apologized for running the cartoon and discussed ways to promote healthy dialogue around issues important to the area’s big Jewish community, Hoffman told the New York Times.\n\nA week later, Doris said a senior editor fired him for violating company policy, though the editor did not specify which policy he breached.\n\nDoris said he was not paid any severance.\n\n“I think it speaks to a misunderstanding or failure to engage with the mission of an editorial page,” he told the Times.\n\nJeff Danziger, the political cartoonist behind the image that stoked uproar, has penned several anti-war drawings throughout his career.\n\nHe told the Times the cartoon was not antisemitic, but “simply a case of, ‘This war’s gone on long enough.'”\n\n“I’m a Vietnam veteran, and I think that I know what I’m talking about — at least from the standpoint of war being bad,” said Danziger, who served as an intelligence officer in the Army and has a Jewish father.",

        "full_text": "A coalition of 21 Democratic attorneys general sued Thursday to block the Trump administration from gutting the Department of Education, arguing that Congress created the Cabinet-level agency and only Congress may abolish it.\n\nThe lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts came two days after Education Secretary Linda McMahon announced that the department’s staff would be cut by about 2,183 employees for a 50% reduction in force.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James called the staffing cuts “reckless and illegal.”\n\n“Today I am taking action to stop the madness and protect our schools and the students who depend on them,” she said in a Thursday press release.\n\nPresident Trump campaigned on a promise to eliminate the department, calling it “a big con job.” The attorneys general accused him of exceeding his authority.\n\n“The Department is an executive agency authorized by Congress, with numerous different laws creating its various programs and funding streams,” said the release. “The coalition’s lawsuit asserts that the executive branch does not have the legal authority to unilaterally incapacitate or dismantle it without an act of Congress.”\n\nThe department began operations in 1980 after President Carter signed into law the Department of Education Organization Act. Critics blasted the move as a sop by the president to the National Education Association in exchange for its campaign endorsement.\n\nRepublicans have sought to eliminate the department since President Reagan took office in 1981, but Mr. Trump’s 50% reduction in force represents the most dramatic step in that direction.\n\nRepublicans argue that the $268 billion department is inefficient, bloated and unnecessary, given that states and local governments are in charge of building and funding schools. Democrats counter that the department provides critical resources.\n\n“This administration may claim to be stopping waste and fraud, but it is clear that their only mission is to take away the necessary services, resources, and funding that students and their families need,” Ms. James said in a Thursday statement. “Firing half of the Department of Education’s workforce will hurt students throughout New York and the nation, especially low-income students and those with disabilities who rely on federal funding.”\n\nPrograms run by the department serve “nearly 18,200 school districts and over 50 million K-12 students attending roughly 98,000 public schools and 32,000 private schools,” said the Democrats in a statement.\n\nSchool districts in New York received $6.17 billion, or $2,438 per student, from the department in Fiscal Year 2024. Republicans argue that the funding comes with strings, such as requiring schools to adopt diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\n\nThe department said Tuesday that it will continue to fulfill its statutory obligations despite the staffing cuts, including student loans, Pell Grants, funding for special-needs students, grant-making and formula funding, but the Democrats were leery.\n\n“The administration’s layoff is so massive that ED will be incapacitated and unable to perform essential functions,” said the Democratic attorneys general in a press release.\n\nThe Democratic attorneys general joining Ms. James represent the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe department’s reduction in force included 600 employees who voluntarily retired or resigned. About 1,400 will be placed on administrative leave starting Friday.\n\nMs. McMahon said the workforce reductions reflect the department’s “commitment to efficiency, accountability, and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents, and teachers.”\n\n“I appreciate the work of the dedicated public servants and their contributions to the Department,” she said in her Tuesday statement. “This is a significant step toward restoring the greatness of the United States education system.”\n\nThe Education Department is the third-youngest of the Cabinet-level departments, older only than Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs.\n\n• Stephen Dinan contributed to this story.",

        "full_text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that Russia agrees in principle with the United States' ceasefire proposal, but key terms still need to be negotiated. He stressed that any agreement should lead to lasting peace and address the root causes of the conflict.\n\nPutin pointed out that Ukrainian troops remain encircled in their last foothold in Russia's Kursk region, and it must be determined whether they will surrender before the ceasefire takes effect.\n\nSpeaking to reporters before his meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, President Donald Trump reiterated his call for Russia to agree to a 30-day ceasefire with Ukraine.\n\n\"You don't want to waste time with a ceasefire if it's not going to mean anything. So we're saying, 'This is what you can get. This is what you can't get,'\" Trump said.\n\n\"Now we're going to see whether or not Russia is there and if they're not, it will be a very disappointing moment for the world,\" he added.\n\nLater, appearing with Rutte in the Oval Office, Trump called Putin's remarks \"promising but incomplete.\"\n\nThe ceasefire proposal, presented by U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff during negotiations in Moscow, was already accepted by Ukraine in talks held in Saudi Arabia earlier this week.\n\nThe diplomatic effort coincided with a Russian claim that its troops have driven the Ukrainian military out of a key town in Russia's Kursk border region, where Moscow has been trying for seven months to dislodge Ukrainian forces from their foothold.\n\nOn Thursday, Putin also emphasized the need to establish a mechanism to monitor potential violations of the truce and raised concerns about whether Ukraine might use the 30-day ceasefire to mobilize troops and rearm.\n\n\"We agree with the proposals to halt the fighting, but we proceed from the assumption that the ceasefire should lead to lasting peace and remove the root causes of the crisis,\" Putin said.\n\nPutin observed that while the U.S. appears to have persuaded Ukraine to accept a ceasefire, Kyiv's motivation likely stems from the battlefield situation. He pointed out that Ukrainian forces that entered the Kursk region are on the verge of being completely encircled in the coming days.\n\n\"Under these conditions, I believe it would be beneficial for Ukraine to secure a ceasefire for at least 30 days,\" he said.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, a senior Kremlin official rejected the idea of a temporary ceasefire, saying Russia was only interested in a long-term resolution of the Ukraine conflict, Russian media reported.\n\nBrian Taylor, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, told Newsweek via email: \"It's important to listen carefully to what Putin is saying. He supported the idea of a ceasefire in general, but then proceeded to stress the need to address the 'root causes' of the conflict. To Putin, the 'root cause' of the conflict is Ukraine's desire to be an independent country and choose it's own path in domestic and foreign policy. Further, he pointed to 'nuances' and proceeded to ask at least sixteen questions about the details of any ceasefire agreement. Putin's answer seems carefully crafted to sound like a 'yes' to Trump but be a 'no' in practice, unless Ukraine is forced to submit to Russia's demands.\"\n\nYuri Ushakov, an aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin, told Russia-1: \"We believe that our goal is a long-term peaceful settlement. We strive for this, a peaceful settlement that takes into account the legitimate interests of our country, our well-known concerns. It seems to me that no one needs any steps that imitate peaceful actions in this situation.\"\n\nWhite House national security adviser Mike Waltz said in a statement Tuesday: \"The Ukrainian delegation today made something very clear, that they share President Trump's vision for peace, they share his determination to end the fighting, to end the killing, to end the tragic meat grinder of people.\"\n\nUkraine President Volodymir Zelensky said in a video address on Sunday: \"We hope for results, both in bringing peace closer and in continuing support.\"\n\nWitkoff is set to meet with Putin on Thursday night in Moscow.\n\n\"The meeting between Witkoff and President Vladimir Putin will take place in a closed format this evening,\" Ushakov told the Russian state-owned news outlet Izvestia.\n\nThis story includes reporting from the Associated Press.\n\nUpdate 3/13/25, 12:58 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.\n\nUpdate 3/13/25, 12:22 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.\n\nUpdate 3/13/25, 1:26 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.\n\nUpdate 3/13/25, 2:03 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information and remarks by Trump.\n\nUpdate 3/13/25, 2:23 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information remarks.",

        "full_text": "Some academic institutions are finally facing a long-overdue reckoning after refusing to enforce the law (and their own policies) in the face of systemic abuses and lawlessness from pro-Hamas mobs. Jewish students have been threatened, attacked, harassed, and even prevented from attending classes or walking freely on their own campuses. Many of these episodes arguably or incontrovertibly constitute civil rights violations, on top of all the other chaos and dysfunction. One of the worst hotbeds of this disgraceful lawlessness has been Columbia University of the Ivy League, which now stands to lose hundreds of millions in taxpayer-funded grants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat bitter, richly-deserved reality is reportedly starting to set in:\n\nOne wonders if Columbia 'leadership' regrets taking this advice from Chuck Schumer:\n\nSenate majority leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) reportedly told Columbia University administrators to ignore the backlash they were receiving over the school’s handling of antisemitism on campus earlier this year, according to a new report from the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. Text messages included in the 300-page report reveal Schumer told then-university president Minouche Shafik that the school’s “political problems are really only among Republicans” and advised that its leaders should just “keep heads down” until the controversy came to an end.\n\nOops. Now the Trump administration is in charge and that plan has worked out very, very badly for Columbia. Other schools seem to be frantically trying to adjust to the new status quo, in which rampant anti-Semitism and pro-Hamas mobs won't be indulged by the federal government any longer:\n\nIt's amazing what threatened funding can do to light a fire under craven, gutless college administrators, who have previously feared their student and faculty mobs more than anything else. Amid some overdue accountability, Politico served up this pathetic headline:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Twitter/X 'Community Note' is helpful here:\n\nThe groups at issue are not “anti-war,”as this post claims. They call for violence explicitly — “violence is the only path forward.” Their most common phrase is: “We support liberation by any means necessary, including armed resistance.”\n\nAs I pointed out, these are neither \"anti-war\" nor \"protests.\" They are law-breaking mobs of Jew haters and terrorist supporters. They are not against war. They actively support violence and are rooting for Hamas in the war Hamas started. Put another way, they are very pro-war, so long as the Jews die and the Jewish state does not successfully defend itself. As for the deportation controversy involving a former Columbia grad student, I'll leave you with this juxtaposition:\n\nMany of those expressing outrage that this Hamas supporter may be deported have said nothing in defense of the Americans butchered and kidnapped by Hamas. Indeed, many of these same people tacitly or expressly supported the butchery and hostage-taking. I'm open to reasoned legal arguments about the case, which is why I'd recommend this piece by longtime federal prosecutor Andy McCarthy, who examines the facts and the law -- and argues in favor of deportation.",

It’s the first watchlist of the year.\n\nClaiming the U.S. was “once a global champion for democracy and human rights,” CIVICUS said Trump’s attempts to remake the federal government in his vision and remove the U.S. from global participation have raised concerns that it is infringing on democratic freedoms.\n\nThe U.S. joins the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan, Chile, Slovakia and 37 other countries on the list of countries with “narrowed” civic freedoms.\n\n“This is an unparalleled attack on the rule of law in the United States, not seen since the days of McCarthyism in the twentieth century,” Mandeep Tiwana, the interim co-secretary-general of CIVICUS, said in a release.\n\n“Restrictive executive orders, unjustifiable institutional cutbacks, and intimidation tactics through threatening pronouncements by senior officials in the administration are creating an atmosphere to chill democratic dissent, a cherished American ideal,” Tiwana added.\n\nCIVICUS’s “narrowed” category means people in the country can exercise civil freedoms but there are occasional violations of those rights. It is the second-highest rating tier after “open.”\n\nThe organization pointed to Trump’s mass firing of federal workers and replacing civil servants with loyalists as actions that could “severely impact constitutional freedoms.”\n\nTrump has carefully selected people who have proven deep loyalty to him to serve in powerful positions – regardless of experience or expertise.\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk, a “special government employee” with no official title, has assisted Trump in drastically reducing the federal workforce as they seek to cut spending by flagging departments, agencies or policies they believe are wasteful, abusive or fraudulent.\n\nAs a result, it has essentially stripped the U.S. Agency for International Development of its authority to provide humanitarian aid and assistance, as well as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau of its ability to enforce regulations that protect consumers from fraud or unfair practices.\n\nThrough executive orders, Trump has sought to consolidate power in the executive branch, making it easier for him and his allies to monitor and control departments and agencies to ensure they are only carrying out Trump’s agenda.\n\nThat includes ceasing all diversity, equity and inclusion policies, cracking down on pro-Palestinian student protests and providing assistance to undocumented immigrants.\n\n“The Trump administration seems hellbent on dismantling the system of checks and balances, which are the pillars of a democratic society,” Tiwana said in the press release.\n\nMonday’s list is not the first time the U.S. has been downgraded on CIVICUS’s watchlist. The country’s status was downgraded to “obstructed” in 2020 after CIVICUS found the Trump administration repressed mass protests.",

        "full_text": "“We have a serious problem in this country, which is that the American Bar Association, our major university law schools, and our major law firms have become an instrument of the hard Left,” deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said in a recent television interview, adding that “big law” has attempted “to turn law into an instrument of political repression for too many years.”\n\nThe ABA, established in the late 1800s, has grown into a sprawling organization that touts a membership of over 400,000 legal workers. It claims to be the “national voice of the legal profession,” weighing in on nominations of federal judges, engaging in litigation, and influencing hiring processes in other areas of the legal industry. A siloed-off part of the ABA handles law school accreditation, setting standards for universities and sparking controversies when those standards wade into political territory.\n\nSen. Mike Lee (R-UT), an outspoken legal voice in Congress, blasted the ABA this week as a “radical left-wing advocacy group.” Lee joined a handful of his Republican colleagues in writing a letter to the ABA’s president condemning the organization for embracing “woke initiatives,” including its heavy use of diversity, equity, and inclusion in many facets of its work.\n\nJudicial nominees\n\nThe Republicans, most of whom are on the panel that vets judicial nominations, said they would no longer consider the ABA’s ratings of prospective judges, which they said functioned as mere “endorsements” for Democratic-aligned nominees. Since the Eisenhower administration, the ABA has typically been given a heads-up on candidates for the federal bench and evaluated them as unqualified, qualified, or well qualified.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have boasted in the past about the ABA’s positive evaluations of their preferred candidates, such as Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, who received the highest rating the organization gives. But numerous conservative appointees have also received negative or mixed evaluations.\n\nThe GOP’s grievances with the ABA date back decades. The George W. Bush administration ended the practice of giving the ABA a first look at nominees, setting off a pattern in which Democratic administrations brought the practice back and the first Trump administration halted it again. The ABA has maintained that it will rate the nominees regardless of whether it is given early access to them.\n\nThe Republican senators called on Trump to stop referring to the ABA for the nomination process again — and if the past is any indication, Trump may be receptive to their request.\n\n‘Alienation of many conservatives’\n\nRight-of-center lawyers, such as George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, have said the ABA’s membership is diminished despite the organization still doing “many admirable things.”\n\n“Part of that decline may reflect the ideological bias of the organization,” Turley told the Washington Examiner. “The ABA once eschewed taking positions on political or ideological issues. It now regularly weighs in on such issues and is viewed as an overwhelmingly liberal organization.”\n\nThe ABA promotes Democratic-aligned viewpoints, such as “LGBTQ+” initiatives, support for abortion access, and DEI.\n\n“There are good-faith disagreements over constitutional interpretations, but the ABA often speaks for the members on adopting positions with its largely liberal leadership,” Turley said. “The result has been the alienation of many conservative, libertarian, and moderate lawyers.”\n\nSouth Texas College law professor Josh Blackman has frequently made similar observations and has urged the ABA to elevate members to its internal committees who span the ideological spectrum.\n\n“As the ABA drifts further and further away from the regulation of the legal profession, and focuses more and more on achieving progressive societal goals, the organization’s mandate dissolves,” Blackman warned in 2023.\n\nTrump administration\n\nTrump’s recently confirmed attorney general, Pam Bondi, has also taken aim at the ABA.\n\nBondi wrote a warning letter last month to its Council of the Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar, a powerful part of the ABA that operates independently of the rest of the organization and is the sole body to dole out law school accreditations.\n\nThe council has “for years” imposed “unlawful race and sex discrimination” on law students and staff “under the guise of ‘diversity’ mandates,” Bondi said. She said that while she was glad the section’s Standard 206, which requires schools’ “commitment to diversity,” had recently been suspended, it should be repealed entirely.\n\nMore broadly, the Trump administration is seeking out entities in the legal industry with Democratic ties, a move that comes as Trump has torn into lawyers working to help his political enemies or hinder his efforts to reshape rapidly and slim down the federal government through mass firings, abrupt contract terminations, and spending freezes.\n\nTrump signed executive orders stripping two major law firms of security clearances, Perkins Coie, which aided former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, and Covington & Burling, which Politico reported has been helping former Trump prosecutor Jack Smith. Individual lawyers have also drawn Trump’s wrath and been told they have lost security clearances, including prominent Democratic lawyer Norm Eisen and longtime lawyer Mark Zaid, who has represented clients in national security lawsuits across the political spectrum for years. Some of the lawyers and firms on Trump’s target list have already signaled they are pushing back on the president through lawsuits.\n\nTrump himself has not directly addressed the ABA’s role in judicial nominees, but the organization’s statement last week signaled it is displeased with the new administration.\n\nThe ABA’s president wrote that he is seeing from the Trump administration “wide-scale affronts to the rule of law itself, such as attacks on constitutionally protected birthright citizenship, the dismantling of USAID and the attempts to criminalize those who support lawful programs to eliminate bias and enhance diversity.”\n\nTRUMP SUSPENDS SECURITY CLEARANCES FOR LAWYERS WHO AIDED JACK SMITH\n\nWhen asked for comment on Republicans’ criticisms of the ABA, an organization spokesman pointed to the ABA accreditation council’s letter responding to Bondi.\n\nIn it, the council said its controversial Standard 206 “has been suspended and is not being enforced.” The council also reiterated that the section of the ABA that deals with accreditation is walled off from the rest of the ABA. The ABA has not responded to the GOP senators.",

        "full_text": "SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah will become the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, despite widespread opposition from dentists and national health organizations.\n\nRepublican Gov. Spencer Cox said he would sign legislation that bars cities and communities from deciding whether to add the mineral to their water systems.\n\nFluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.\n\nGovernment researchers have found that community water fluoridation prevents about 25% of tooth decay.\n\n“We’ve got tried and true evidence of the safety and efficacy of this public health initiative,” said American Dental Association President Brad Kessler, of Denver. Cavities could start emerging in children within months or years of Utah stopping fluoridation, Kessler said.\n\nThe ban comes weeks after federal health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has expressed skepticism about water fluoridation, was sworn into office.\n\n“It's not a bill I care that much about,” Cox added, “but it's a bill I will sign.”\n\nUtah lawmakers who pushed for a ban said putting fluoride in water was too expensive. Its Republican sponsor, Rep. Stephanie Gricius, acknowledged fluoride has benefits, but said it was an issue of “individual choice” to not have it in the water.\n\nCox said that like many people in Utah, he grew up and raised his own children in a community that doesn’t have fluoridated water — or what he called a “natural experiment.”\n\n“You would think you would see drastically different outcomes with half the state not getting it. We haven’t seen that,” Cox said in a weekend interview with ABC4 in Salt Lake City. “So it’s got to be a really high bar for me if we’re going to require people to be medicated by their government.”\n\nAlready, some cities across the country have gotten rid of fluoride from their water, and other municipalities are considering doing the same. A few months ago, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate fluoride in drinking water because high levels could pose a risk to kids’ intellectual development.\n\nA Utah teenager who urged lawmakers to pass the bill described suffering a medical emergency when the fluoride pump in Sandy, Utah, malfunctioned in 2019, releasing an excessive amount of the mineral into the drinking water. The fluoride sickened hundreds of residents and led many in Utah to push for its removal.\n\nIt’s rare to find high levels of fluoridation in water, according to the National Institutes of Health. The agency said it’s “virtually impossible” to get a toxic dose of fluoride from water with standard levels of the mineral.\n\nKessler said the amounts of fluoride added to drinking water have been reduced over time and are below levels considered problematic.\n\n“The science proves that it is effective at reducing cavities with little to no risk of other problems,” he said.\n\nHe added that a ban in Utah could have a domino effect with other legislatures being encouraged to follow suit with fluoride bans in their states.\n\nOpponents warned it would disproportionately affect low-income residents who may rely on public drinking water having fluoride as their only source of preventative dental care. Low-income families may not be able to afford regular dentist visits or the fluoride tablets some people buy as a supplement in cities without fluoridation.\n\nFluoridation is the most cost-effective way to prevent tooth decay on a large scale, said Lorna Koci, who chairs the Utah Oral Health Coalition.\n\nUtah in 2022 ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents that receive fluoridated water, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About two in five Utah residents served by community water systems received fluoridated water.\n\nIn February, the city council in Riverton, a Salt Lake City suburb, unanimously passed a resolution to remove fluoride from the city’s public water systems. Voters in Brigham City, 59 miles (95 kilometers) north of the capital city, struck down by a large margin a measure in 2023 that would have removed the mineral from its public water supply.\n\nOut of the 484 Utah water systems that reported data to the CDC in 2024, only 66 fluoridated their water, an Associated Press analysis showed. The largest was the state’s biggest city, Salt Lake City.\n\nRodney Thornell, president of the Utah Dental Association, began practicing dentistry in a Salt Lake City suburb before the city added fluoride to its water. His adult patients who grew up locally continue to get lots of cavities but younger patients who grew up with fluoride in the water get fewer, he said.\n\n“If we’re going to keep eating sugar, we need fluoride.” Thornell said, noting that Utah residents consume more than the national average of candy and sugary drinks.\n\n___\n\nBrown reported from Billings, Montana.",

        "full_text": "Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, dressed in fatigues, visited a command post near the front in Kursk late Wednesday to cheer on his military’s ejection of Ukrainian forces from much of the territory they had been occupying in the Russian border region.\n\nThe Russian leader’s pointed visit came a day after a U.S. delegation met in Saudi Arabia with Ukrainian officials, who agreed to a 30-day cease-fire in the war. American officials planned to take the proposal to Mr. Putin, who has previously said he is not interested in a temporary truce.\n\nDressed in a green camouflage uniform, Mr. Putin sat at a desk with maps spread out in front of him, according to photos released by the Kremlin. He appeared with Russia’s top military officer, Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov.\n\nIn video footage released by Russian state media, Mr. Putin praised the Russian military formations that had taken back much of the territory captured by Ukraine in the Kursk region. He called on the troops to seize the territory for good from Ukrainian forces, who have been occupying portions of the Russian border region since last summer. Kyiv had hoped to use the territory as a bargaining chip in peace talks.\n\nThe Russian leader also demanded that Ukrainian forces taken prisoner in the region be treated and prosecuted as terrorists under Russian law. General Gerasimov said more than 400 Ukrainian troops had been captured in the operations.\n\n“People who are on the territory of the Kursk region, committing crimes here against the civilian population and opposing our armed forces, law enforcement agencies and special services, in accordance with the laws of the Russian Federation, are terrorists,” Mr. Putin said.\n\nHe added that “foreign mercenaries” do not fall under the Geneva Convention governing the treatment of prisoners of war. The conflict, which began with Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, has drawn foreign fighters. This month, Russia sentenced a 22-year-old British man who had volunteered for the Ukrainian Army to 19 years in prison on terrorism and mercenary charges, after his capture in the Kursk region last year.\n\nRussian forces stepped up an offensive to push Ukrainian troops out of the region this week, as Kyiv reeled from the Trump administration’s decision last week to freeze U.S. intelligence and military assistance to Ukraine after an explosive confrontation in the Oval Office between President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.\n\nBy then, Russian forces were already well on their way to taking back Sudzha, the main population center in the Kursk region that was captured by Ukraine last year.\n\nFor months, Ukraine’s occupation of Russian territory has been a sore point for Moscow, which bolstered its forces with North Korean soldiers in an attempt to take back the land.\n\nRussian officials boasted of a breakthrough attack in Kursk last Saturday, when, they said, some 800 fighters traveled about 10 miles through a disused gas pipeline to carry out a surprise attack on the Ukrainian rear.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ukraine’s top military commander, Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky, said in a statement that Ukrainian forces would be moving to “more advantageous positions” if necessary and would “hold the line in the Kursk region for as long as it remains reasonable and necessary.” He added, “In the most difficult situations, my priority has been and remains the preservation of Ukrainian soldiers’ lives.”\n\nMr. Putin has said that any temporary cease-fire or truce will only provide an advantage to Ukrainian forces, who are on the back foot on the battlefield and could use the reprieve to replenish personnel.\n\nRussia has demanded a broader security agreement backed by the West, including a guarantee that Ukraine will not be admitted to the NATO military alliance, as well as other commitments that risk eroding Ukraine’s sovereignty.\n\n“We do not need a truce,” Mr. Putin said during his annual news briefing in December. “We need peace: a long-term and lasting peace with guarantees for the Russian Federation and its citizens.”\n\nMarc Santora contributed reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine.",

This will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S.,\" Trump said on Truth Social.\n\nOn Tuesday, the European Commission, the executive body of the EU, announced it was retaliating against U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum by lifting the suspension on previous levies on U.S. goods, including whiskey, and imposing new ones. Those changes will take effect in April.\n\n\"The European Union must act to protect consumers and business.

        "full_text": "Trump pledges to match EU and Canada's retaliatory tariffs\n\n7 days ago\n\nNatalie Sherman\n\nBusiness reporter, BBC News\n\nUS President Donald Trump has pledged to impose more tariffs after his latest move to introduce import taxes on steel and aluminium entering the US prompted retaliation from the European Union (EU) and Canada.\n\nTrump said that \"of course\" he would respond to the countermeasures, repeating his warning to reveal \"reciprocal\" tariffs next month on countries around the world.\n\n\"Whatever they charge us with, we're charging them,\" he said.\n\nThe threat marked a further escalation of a trade war which has rattled financial markets amid concerns over the impact on the economies and consumers in many countries around the world, including the US.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump moved forward with a plan to widen US tariffs on steel and aluminium, imposing a blanket duty of 25% and ending exemptions that the US had previously granted for shipments from some countries.\n\nThat followed an order earlier this month that raised levies on Chinese imports into the US to at least 20%.\n\nTrump has also threatened tariffs - which are taxes applied to goods as they enter a country - on a range of more specific items, including copper, lumber and cars.\n\nLeaders in Canada and Europe called the new metals taxes unjustified and struck back with their own tariffs on a range of US products.\n\nOther countries that are key US suppliers of metals, including the UK, Australia, Mexico and Brazil, held off on any immediate retaliation.\n\n\"Like everybody else, I'm disappointed to see global tariffs in relation to steel and aluminium but we will take a pragmatic approach,\" said UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.\n\n\"We are...negotiating a deal which covers and includes tariffs if we succeed. But we will keep all options on the table.\"\n\n'Bad for business, worse for consumers'\n\nCanada said from Thursday it would start charging a 25% tax on nearly C$30bn ($20bn; £16bn) worth of US products, including steel, computers and sports equipment.\n\nPrime Minister-designate Mark Carney said he was ready to negotiate a renewed trade deal with Trump, as long as there was \"respect for Canadian sovereignty\".\n\nThe EU said it would raise its levies on up to €26bn ($28bn; £22bn) worth of US goods, including boats, bourbon and motorbikes, from 1 April.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the response was intended to be \"strong but proportionate\" and added that the EU stood \"ready to engage in a meaningful dialogue\".\n\n\"Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business and worse for consumers,\" she said, warning the economic disruption put jobs at stake and would send prices higher.\n\n\"Nobody needs that – on both sides, neither in the European Union nor in the United States.\"\n\nTrump had said he wants to boost US steel and aluminium production in the longer run, but critics say in the immediate term the taxes on imports of the metals will raise prices for US consumers and dent economic growth.\n\nMajor packaged food makers including Quaker Oats and Folgers coffee asked Trump for targeted exemptions from tariffs on imports such as cocoa and fruit, according to a letter seen by Reuters.\n\nPepsiCo, Conagra and J M Smucker, also requested the president exempt ingredients not available from US sources in the letter, which was sent by the trade group the Consumer Brands Association.\n\nCoffee, oats, cocoa, spices, tropical fruit and tin mill steel, used for some food and household goods, are among the imports listed as unavailable domestically, Reuters reported.\n\nThe import taxes are also expected to reduce demand for steel and aluminium that is not made in the US - a blow to makers of the metals elsewhere.\n\nThe EU estimated that the latest US tariffs affect about 5% of its total exports to the US, while the US is the destination for roughly 90% of Canada's steel and aluminium exports.\n\nShares in the US were mixed on Wednesday, after two days of sharp decline. The Dow closed down 0.2%, while the S&P 500 ended nearly 0.5% higher and the Nasdaq jumped 1.2%.\n\nIn an appearance at the White House with the Irish prime minister, Taoiseach Micheál Martin, Trump said he did not plan to back down from his trade fight, saying he was \"not happy\" with EU trade policies.\n\nHe cited concerns about legal penalties it has imposed on Apple and rules he claimed put US farm products and cars at a disadvantage.\n\n\"They're doing what they should be doing perhaps for the European Union but it does create ill will,\" he said.\n\nRepeating his threat to hit European cars with tariffs, he added later: \"We're going to win that financial battle.\"",

        "full_text": "Donald Trump has a gift for inheriting valuable things. And the economy of January 2025 was no exception.\n\nWhen the president took office, stock values were hitting record highs, unemployment was hovering near historic lows, and consumer confidence was stable. Wall Street expected that business conditions would only improve. Among investors, conventional wisdom held that Trump was serious about corporate tax cuts — but not about launching an unprovoked trade war against America’s closest allies (a proposition too pointless and self-destructive to be sincere).\n\nTimes have changed. Contrary to corporate America’s wishful thinking, Trump has made good on his promise for large tariffs on Chinese goods, steel and aluminum from all countries, and many Mexican and Canadian imports, triggering retaliatory tariffs from America’s trade partners. Largely as a result of these developments, US stock markets forfeited six months of gains in three weeks, while consumer confidence fell precipitously. All this has led countless Americans to ask whether their economy is headed for a recession (Google searches for that word have skyrocketed since the beginning of March).\n\nThere is no certain answer to that question. Economic forecasters generally believe that the risk of a US downturn in 2025 has risen sharply over the past month, but still remains unlikely. What’s left of Wall Street’s optimism rests on a simple truth: Trump (almost certainly) has the power to stabilize the economy whenever he pleases by merely abandoning his most arbitrary and haphazard trade policies. But betting on the president’s prudence seems only a little safer than investing in his memecoin.\n\nWhy Wall Street is increasingly worried about the risk of a recession\n\nThe probability of a US recession has risen in recent weeks, according to major US banks. JPMorgan Chase now pegs the risk of a 2025 economic downturn at 40 percent, up from 30 percent at the start of the year. Goldman Sachs raised its own recession probability from 15 percent to 20 percent last week.\n\nEven if the US does not enter a proper recession — which is defined as six months of declining economic activity — the outlook for economic growth has soured, according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve, Morgan Stanley, and other analysts.\n\nTrump’s trade policies are the primary cause of such darkening forecasts.\n\nLarge and perpetually shifting tariffs hurt the economy in multiple ways. Tariffs are a tax on foreign-made goods paid by importers — such as retailers or manufacturers — who tend to pass their heightened costs onto consumers. This effectively reduces Americans’ purchasing power. According to one estimate from the Peterson Institute, if Trump’s tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada were to be fully implemented, and left in place, they would cost the typical US household $1,200 a year.\n\nWhen Americans make less money, they tend to reduce their spending on goods and services. And when consumer demand declines, businesses often lay off workers, who must then reduce their own spending — a dynamic that can yield a self-reinforcing, recessionary cycle.\n\nTrump has mitigated his tariffs’ impact on consumers by repeatedly pausing them, or adding temporary exemptions for certain goods. Yet the fact that the president’s trade policy is constantly changing creates its own problems.\n\nEconomic uncertainty is bad for investment. As harmful as Trump’s tariffs are, if businesses knew they would be permanent, then some might invest in new US factories or mines that wouldn’t have been financially viable under conditions of free trade. By contrast, if no one can be sure that Trump won’t roll back those tariffs tomorrow then investing in such factories would be perilous. Uncertainty therefore leads many investors and companies to delay investment until long-term economic conditions become clear. And a pullback in investment reduces demand in the economy, thereby increasing the risk of recession.\n\nThese factors lay the groundwork for a stock market selloff. But that sell-off was accelerated by the president’s nonchalant attitude toward falling equity values. For months, financial analysts had assumed that the stock market boasted a veto over Trump’s most ill-advised economic policies: Given the president’s past enthusiasm for bragging about record stock prices, many believed that Trump would roll back his tariffs in response to any sustained drop.\n\nBut over the past week, the president and his advisers have signaled the opposite: That they are comfortable with inducing economic pain in the immediate term, for the sake of realizing their broader ideological goals. Asked about whether he expected a recession this year, Trump told Fox News last Sunday that he didn’t like to “predict things like that” but “there is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big. … And there are always periods of, it takes a little time.”\n\nAlthough Trump has been the primary driver of declining investor sentiment, he is not the sole cause of economic concern. The economy of January 2025 was broadly considered strong. But it had some vulnerabilities. Years of inflation had eroded Americans’ savings, causing some to fall behind on their loans. Credit card delinquencies and late payments on auto loans both rose in the final quarter of last year. And the labor market has shown some signs of slackening, with the percentage of Americans who say they can only find part-time work rising and the typical number of weekly hours worked falling to its lowest point since June 2010.\n\nThe Trump-induced stock market collapse risks exacerbating these sources of economic strain, since affluent households often pare back spending when the value of their stock portfolios declines.\n\nThe risk of a downturn is rising, but the odds are still low\n\nAll this said, there’s reason to think fears of an imminent recession have been overhyped. One source of such anxieties is the Atlanta Fed’s GDP forecast, which turned negative in recent weeks. But the Fed’s model is highly volatile, and its current projections are largely informed by data from early this year, particularly a 0.2 percent decline in consumer spending during January.\n\nBut there’s reason to think that this dip reflected fleeting headwinds. After all, much of the country experienced major winter storms in January, while southern California was devastated by wildfires. These natural disasters surely kept many Americans away from retailers, restaurants, and other businesses.\n\nIt is true that consumer sentiment has fallen precipitously in recent months, in response to the public’s anxieties over Trump’s tariffs. But such surveys have not been very predictive of consumers’ actual spending habits in recent years.\n\nMeanwhile, the US economy continued adding jobs in February and unemployment remains low by historical standards. One of the government’s gauges of inflation also came in unexpectedly low Wednesday, showing that consumer prices were only 2.8 percent higher in February 2025 than they were one year earlier. If inflation continues to decline, then the Federal Reserve may feel comfortable cutting interest rates, which would make it easier for consumers to spend and businesses to invest.\n\nTrump could stabilize the economy if he wanted to\n\nWhile the US economy isn’t devoid of complicated challenges, Trump could all but eliminate the threat of a recession anytime he wishes. All he needs to do is rescind his unpopular and arbitrary tariffs.\n\nDoing so would not undermine any of the president’s more respectable economic goals. Putting 25 percent tariffs on industrial inputs made in Canada and Mexico is not beneficial for American manufacturing, but harmful to it. And alienating core US allies does not bolster our nation’s national security but jeopardizes it.\n\nGoldman Sachs’s belief that the risk of a recession is only 20 percent hinges on Trump’s responsiveness to deteriorating economic conditions: The fact that “the White House has the option to pull back if the downside risks begin to look more serious” tempers the bank’s anxiety.\n\nPerhaps, if stocks remain depressed — while unemployment climbs — the president will decide to prioritize Americans’ economic well-being over his own ideological hobby horses. But I’m not sure that I’d put money on it. And a growing number of investors seem to feel the same.",

        "full_text": "Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino.\n\nWith the Republican-controlled Congress moving forward with President Donald Trump’s call to extend the 2017 individual tax cuts, Democrats and Republicans are spinning the facts about who would benefit. Several Democrats have framed the tax cuts as exclusively benefiting billionaires, while Trump has suggested everyone in America would see a tax cut.\n\nOn average, taxpayers in every income group would get some tax relief. But not everyone. In all, about two-thirds to three-quarters of taxpayers would get a tax cut, according to independent analyses. Also, the cuts skew in favor of wealthy Americans, who would see more tax relief not only in the dollar amount but as a percentage of income, on average. But again, the wealthy wouldn’t be the only ones to benefit.\n\n(For clarity, people would experience an extension not as a tax cut but as the absence of a tax increase if the provisions were allowed to expire.)\n\nSome economists also warn that if the GOP plan includes spending cuts to Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits (or food stamps), lower-income Americans would, on net, fare worse, even with the tax cuts.\n\nIn order to pass the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act with a simple majority in the Senate, Republicans had to use a process called reconciliation — which means the law could not add to the deficit after 10 years. To meet that requirement, most of the individual tax cuts are set to expire at the end of 2025.\n\nThe 2017 law lowered marginal tax rates, increased the standard deduction and eliminated the personal exemption, increased the child tax credit, limited deductions for state and local taxes as well as mortgages and home equity lines of credit, and increased the threshold for estate taxes, among other measures.\n\nRepublicans are turning to reconciliation again to extend the tax cuts beyond this year. On Feb. 25, House Republicans took the first step in doing that. They narrowly passed a budget resolution that would allow for $4.5 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years and $2 trillion in spending reductions over the same time period.\n\nThe resolution didn’t specify what spending cuts would be made, but there’s little doubt Medicaid would face cuts under the framework, as we’ve explained. Both houses of Congress need to agree on a budget resolution before any specific spending reductions would be proposed.\n\nWho Benefits from Tax Cut Extension?\n\nWhen the TCJA passed in 2017, the expiring nature of some of the tax cuts led to the oft-repeated, but misleading talking point from Democrats that the top 1% would get 83% of the tax cuts under the new law. As we wrote, that was only true when or if the individual tax provisions expired. (The top 1% would still benefit from the remaining provisions, such as a reduction in the corporate tax rate.)\n\nNow, some Democrats are claiming or suggesting that if the individual tax cuts are extended — as the Republican budget blueprint seeks to do — mostly or only the wealthiest Americans would benefit.\n\nIn her response to Trump’s address to Congress on March 4, Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin said, “President Trump is trying to deliver an unprecedented giveaway to his billionaire friends. He’s on the hunt to find trillions of dollars to pass along to the wealthiest in America.”\n\nIn an interview on CNBC on Feb. 25, Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone went further, wrongly claiming that the “average person” would not benefit from the tax cuts included in the Republican budget plan.\n\nPallone said the Republican tax plan “basically, you know, just helps the very wealthy and large corporate interests.” Advocating allowing the tax cuts to expire, Pallone added, “I don’t think that the average person benefits from this tax cut.”\n\n“The bottom line is the Republicans are doing nothing to try to provide any kind of tax cut or help for the average American,” Pallone said. “It’s all about corporate interests, large corporate interests, billionaires. That’s what this is all about.”\n\nTrump framed the tax cuts much differently in his address to Congress on March 4.\n\n“The next phase of our plan to deliver the greatest economy in history is for this Congress to pass tax cuts for everybody,” Trump said. “They’re in there, they’re waiting for you to vote.”\n\nAn Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center analysis of extending all of the TCJA tax cuts concluded that “on average, all income groups would get a tax cut.”\n\nContrary to Pallone’s claim about the “average person” not benefiting from the extension of TCJA tax cuts, the average taxpayer — defined as the middle 20% of income earners (those earning between $65,100 and $116,400) — would see an average tax cut of $1,030 in 2027, or about 1.3% of after-tax income.\n\nA spokesman for Pallone noted that the average tax cut for someone making under $50,000 would be $273, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, while the average tax cut for a taxpayer making over $1 million would be $78,717. That wealthy taxpayers would derive more benefit is clear, but most “average” taxpayers would derive some benefit from the tax cuts. The spokesman noted that the tax cuts would not be enough to offset the impact of potential spending cuts to Medicaid and other programs.\n\nThat taxpayers in every income category would see tax cuts was echoed in an analysis by the Tax Foundation.\n\n“Making all the expiring provisions permanent, including the estate and business provisions, would increase after-tax incomes by 2.9 percent on average in 2026,” Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy with the Tax Foundation’s Center for Federal Tax Policy, told us via email. “The top quintile would see a 3.3 percent increase on average, while the bottom quintile would see a 2.8 percent increase on average. So while the policies would provide a larger increase in after-tax income to higher income taxpayers, they also provide tax cuts to taxpayers across the income spectrum.”\n\nAnd contrary to Trump’s statement, his tax plans would not result in tax cuts for everybody.\n\nOverall, about three-quarters of households would get a tax cut, while about 10% would get a tax increase, according to the Tax Policy Center analysis. The percentage of winners and losers would vary by income category, TPC found: “About 86% of middle-income households would get a tax cut” while “about 13% would see their taxes rise.” Among the top 1%, “taxes would fall for about 81%, while they’d rise for 19%.”\n\nThat’s only for an extension of the TCJA tax cuts, and Trump has also proposed eliminating taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. But as Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told us via email, “almost nobody benefits from tax-free tips” and “tax free Social Security benefits go almost entirely to high-income retirees (since those with low-incomes already pay no tax on their benefits).”\n\nThe Tax Foundation estimates that making the expiring individual provisions of the TCJA permanent would translate a tax cut for 62% of tax filers, including for 84% of middle income Americans.\n\nAddressing the House GOP Issues Conference on Jan. 27, Trump said that “we want to keep people’s taxes low and actually make them lower. And that’s not just rich people, that’s everybody. It’s frankly proportionately the lower scale much more so than a higher scale.”\n\nHowever, wealthy earners would get an outsized share of tax benefits. TPC estimated that households making over $450,000 (the top 5% of households) would be the income group getting the largest percentage of benefits from extending the tax cuts: just over 45%. Moreover, higher earners would see a higher percentage tax cut than middle- and lower-income Americans. The tax cuts would average 3.2% of after-tax income for the top 1% of households, compared with 1.3% for the middle 20% of households.\n\nIn that same address, Trump falsely claimed that if the TCJA tax cuts were not permanently extended, “you’re going to have about a 60% tax increase.” The TPC estimates that an extension of the tax cuts would reduce the average tax rate by about 1.4 percentage points in 2027.\n\nIn the weekly House Democrats’ press conference on Feb. 25, Democratic Rep. Brendan Boyle said the deep spending cuts proposed in the Republican resolution were being made “to partially pay for trillions of dollars in tax cuts, most of which go to the richest 1% of Americans.”\n\nHis point about the share of benefits going to the top 1% is a bit exaggerated. While the tax cuts are tilted toward the wealthy, the richest 1% — households earning over $1 million — would get 23.5% of the benefits from the tax cuts in 2027 — so not most, according to the TPC. Nonetheless, more than half of the benefits would go to the top 10% that year.\n\nIn its analysis of the House Republican plan, the Penn Wharton Budget Model reached similar conclusions on the distributional effects of the tax cuts on a conventional basis (before the economic impact of the tax cuts are factored in).\n\n“On a conventional basis in 2026, the first 80 percent of the income distribution receives about 29 percent of the total value of the proposed tax cuts while the top 10 percent of the income distribution receives about 56 percent of the value,” Kent Smetters, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, told us via email. He noted that, “under current law, the top 10% of the income distribution pays about 70% of all federal taxes.”\n\nPWBM also considered the results if the tax cuts are paid partially through cuts to Medicaid and SNAP.\n\nIf cuts are made to those programs, “then lower income households are worse off,” Smetters said, though he noted that “those decisions have not been made yet.”\n\nAs we said, it’s unknown whether the House budget resolution will move forward and what specific spending cuts lawmakers will ultimately propose.\n\nGiven the disproportionate effect Medicaid and SNAP cuts would have on lower-income households, “Even with economic growth, lower income households are worse off if mandatory spending cuts, still to be decided under budget reconciliation, are allocated to programs like Medicaid and SNAP,” the PWBM analysis concluded.\n\nMany Democrats — including former President Joe Biden — had also hoped to extend the tax cuts, but only for those making under $400,000 a year. In a House Rules Committee hearing on Feb. 24, Rep. Jim McGovern, the ranking Democrat on the committee, offered several amendments to cap the extension of tax cuts at various income levels — first for those making under $400,000 per year, then at $1 million, then at $100 million, then $1 billion per year. All were rejected along party lines.",

        "full_text": "Given the many global challenges it is tackling, “nobody wants the State Department to be in a position where USAID was, where it had difficulty operating,” the official insisted. (I granted the official and others interviewed anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue.)\n\nFor Rubio, though, the fight over the future structure of the State Department isn’t just about protecting America’s ability to engage in diplomacy. It’s about protecting what power he has in the Trump administration.\n\nThis is, after all, a team of many rivals. Rubio is the chief U.S. diplomat, but an array of other Trump appointees are competing to shape the administration’s foreign policy, from Musk to multiple special envoys. As Musk eyes his department, Rubio has realized he needs to both draw lines and walk some very fine ones.\n\nIt doesn’t help that Rubio’s past foreign policy views have frequently clashed with Trump’s vision. It means Rubio is now taking stances at odds with his reputation, such as slamming the foreign minister of Poland this week.\n\n“He’s in this awkward situation,” said Gerald Feierstein, a former career diplomat who served as U.S. ambassador to Yemen. “He’s doing things that he fundamentally believes are bad policy and bad steps. He’s got to go along with it because Musk and Trump are standing between him and his higher ambition of being president.”\n\nI did not expect to write this often about Rubio (this is my third column on him in two months), and he is far from the only Cabinet member dealing with blowback from moves made by Musk and his aides. But Rubio is drawing unusual interest because USAID’s brutal takedown was so early in Trump’s term, because of the national security implications of slashing the State Department and because he’s already seen as one of the weaker Trump appointees.\n\nTo remedy the last perception, Rubio has taken advantage of what the secretary of State’s perch offers — not the least of which is access to a ready press pool — to show he can score wins for Trump.\n\nHe’s deeply involved in talks about ending Russia’s war on Ukraine; he has pushed, with some success, Panama to distance itself from China amid Trump’s threats of a Panama Canal takeover; and he has helped enforce Trump’s immigration crackdown. Already, he’s spent a significant amount of time on the road, carrying the Trump banner everywhere from the Munich Security Conference to Israel.\n\nAt times, Rubio has seemed out of place.\n\nHis couch-sinking silence as Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy helped inspire a “Saturday Night Live” parody. Still, Rubio has tried to dispel suspicions that he disagrees with Trump, going on television repeatedly to defend positions he would never have taken when he was a senator.\n\nRubio has even publicly supported dismantling USAID. But he didn’t have much say in it. By the time Rubio was named USAID’s acting administrator, Musk, DOGE and Trump political appointee Pete Marocco had largely unraveled the institution.\n\nIt was Rubio, though, who took much of the resulting heat from Capitol Hill, the courts and his own workforce, even as he never gained control of the USAID situation. (He did, however, protect some programs, saving about 400 that DOGE wanted to cut.)\n\nThe State Department is different — and Rubio is less willing to sacrifice it the way he did USAID.\n\nRubio agrees, in principle, with major changes, including staff reductions and closing some diplomatic facilities. But he wants to restructure the department in a way that satisfies Trump and keeps Musk at bay but safeguards his main base of power. If he lets Musk and DOGE eliminate huge chunks of State without a serious strategy, he will only weaken the department and himself. Foreign officials trying to understand Trump administration dynamics are among those watching closely and asking people like myself if Rubio is the best point of contact.\n\n“Rubio wants to be a diplomat,” the person familiar with the situation said. “Everything DOGE does creates problems for him in terms of diplomacy.”\n\nAlthough lists of consulates to close and staffers to fire have been circulating for weeks, Rubio still hasn’t acted, frustrating Musk.\n\nSome Rubio aides and people at the National Security Council tried last week to push out Marocco, who is not in DOGE but is a lead figure in dismantling USAID. Rubio, however, sided with other senior administration officials who wanted to keep Marocco, according to the person familiar with the situation.\n\nThe official close to Rubio denied there was any such attempt. Marocco’s team emailed me a statement from him in which he called Trump and Rubio “historic patriots” and said it was the “honor of a lifetime” to serve the pair to “reform and realign foreign assistance,” but he did not address questions about his job.\n\nThe official further urged patience — a hard ask of U.S. diplomats who fear for their jobs and livelihoods.\n\n“Good, substantive reforms take time,” the official said. “The president’s been pretty clear that there need to be significant changes in the way that the federal government is organized. I think every Cabinet secretary is going about that in their own specific way to make sure those changes are smart, they stick and that core capabilities and functions are retained.”\n\nThe State Department declined to comment, but a senior official there stressed that Musk and Rubio have a “great relationship” and are working together “to correct the failures of the last administration.”\n\nMusk did not respond to my request for comment.\n\nTrump is trying to appease all sides. During last week’s meeting, he told Cabinet members they get to run their agencies but also said Musk would serve as an enforcer to ensure cuts take place.\n\nThe president also has insisted that Rubio and Musk get along just fine. “ELON AND MARCO HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP. ANY STATEMENT OTHER THAN THAT IS FAKE NEWS!!!” Trump posted this weekend on Truth Social.\n\nRubio and Musk are now trying to publicly show that’s true.\n\nRubio used social media to thank DOGE for slashing USAID’s programs, to which Musk replied that it was “good” working with Rubio. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt noted to reporters that the pair attended dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Saturday.\n\nAnd Rubio and Musk took to social media this weekend to gang up on Radosław Sikorski, the foreign minister of Poland, a U.S. ally.\n\nAfter Musk said that Ukraine’s front line could collapse if he turned off his Starlink satellite services, Sikorski noted that his country was paying for those services and might have to find other providers if they were turned off.\n\nRubio dismissed Sikorski as “making up” the threat and told him to “say thank you” for Starlink. Musk piled on: “Be quiet, small man.”\n\nPerhaps beating up on common enemies — a group that these days includes U.S. allies — is the glue that will bond Rubio and Musk together going forward.\n\nThat said, the secretary of State has some tough choices ahead as he restructures his department. He has managed to slow-roll Musk on that front for now, but we’ll see how long the forced bonhomie lasts.",

        "full_text": "Say what you will about Donald Trump, nobody can argue that he doesn’t possess an amazing superpower. Actually, he has several superpowers, but his most powerful may be the ability to convince his opponents to defend the least popular possible positions just because he supports them. Not just contrary positions, not just positions that reasonable people can disagree with, but insanely unpopular positions that all normal people look at and are repelled by. There’s not a garbage hill they won’t choose to die on. It’s an incredibly useful superpower to have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, the most recent one is the 80/20 polling proposition against men pretending to be women and being allowed into women’s intimate spaces to steal their athletic achievements. What lunatic would possibly take the position that it’s OK for some dude with the whole sausage store swinging to walk into your daughter’s locker room and expect to be called Martha? Well, it’s not just one lunatic. It’s a whole party of lunatics. This is a sacred Democrat belief, maybe its most sacred belief. Just the other day, every single Democrat senator voted to continue this nonsense. But in the real world, eight out of 10 normal people understand that it’s insane, and the other 20%, probably half of them, don’t agree with the majority because they can’t wrap their minds around the fact that it’s actually happening.\n\nOf course, Trump opposes it, and of course, he rubbed it in their faces at that glorious not-State of the Union address the other night. Naturally, the Democrats highlighted their embrace of this bizarre, creepy fringe belief system right in front of 36 million Americans. It’s no wonder that 76% of the people who watched the thing supported the president. Politically, it’s just insane to draw the battle lines about weirdos and perverts, but the Democrats do it. It kind of tells you what their main constituency is – weirdos and perverts and the SSRI-ridden, Chardonnay wine Munchhausen Mommies that love them.\n\nEmbracing it makes absolutely no sense politically unless their entire focus is maintaining their psychotic leftist activist base. And, of course, their entire focus is maintaining their psychotic leftist activist base. You might think they would reach out in a systematic way to normal people, and some have tried. Gavin Newsom, the guy whose unalloyed support for kiddie castration and against penis-free female environments helped make California the sexual confusion capital of America, recently went on with Charlie Kirk and hinted that, well, you know, maybe it’s kinda unfair to let some hairy ape pretending to be a ballerina win the gold medal in a girl track meet. Don’t get the idea that he is actually going to do anything about it. California is still a gender freak state where every pervert is a king, and every normal person is liable to be leered at in the locker room – and, in his trash state, if you complain that some dude in a skirt is drooling over you while you slip on your panties, you’re a hate criminal. Other Democrats have realized that this is electoral cyanide, and they’ve tried to thread the needle by suggesting that maybe local governments should decide whether the perverts rule or not. They don’t think that about anything else, like abortion, just this, and they don’t really think it. If they get federal power back, you can be sure that the full force of law will come down in support of weirdo transvestites getting a free pass at exposing themselves to little girls.\n\nTrump is somehow able to maneuver them into being all for such loathsome demographics as federal workers. Yeah, Americans feel sorry for the kind of person who tells them they can’t sign their VA form in blue ink. Not a lotta sympathy there. And Americans seem to like the idea of cutting government waste. Sure, the Democrats insist that we’re about to launch a Third World genocide by refusing to fully fund Ecuadorian transgender mime troupes, but normal people look at that and hear that it’s being cut, and they think it’s a good thing. This is because it is, objectively, a good thing. To support this stuff is, objectively, an insane thing.\n\nNow, it’s not crazy in the sense that doing so does support the Democrat position that all normality and civilization must be overthrown in favor of the bizarre, creepy freak show utopia that they hope to impose upon us. It’s insane because it’s electoral poison. Look at what happened to Kamala Harris when she got up there and had to try and tap dance about subsidizing illegal alien transsexual surgeries. It’s hard to explain this sort of stuff, and it should be hard because this sort of stuff is stupid and horrific. A few Democrats understand that this stuff repels normal people. That’s their problem. And that’s Trump’s edge.\n\nWhat’s the latest? Some Third World Muslim scumbag terrorist-lover who somehow got into our country and somehow got into one of our allegedly prestigious schools is using that as a base to demand the murder of Jews and everybody else. Remember – they don’t just want to stop killing all the Jews. They want to kill you and me, too. They will tell you that if you listen, and thanks to the fact that we have broken the gatekeeping model of the regime media, conservative media, and social media can now tell you. You can go read what this scumbag’s positions are. He wants October 7 all over the world. That means you and your kids and your sons and your daughters are being raped and murdered on videotape for the delight of Third World semi-humans. Yeah, we’re totally morally obligated to let this creature onto our soil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s been said before: The Constitution is not a suicide pact.\n\nNow, the reasonable position among Americans is that this kind of walking, talking pile of refried goat excrement shouldn’t be anywhere near our country. It’s not a matter of free speech. You don’t get to come here and start setting up your garbage revolution. Do the Democrats agree with that view? No. They’re perfectly happy to let the genocidal jihadi to do his thing. In this monster, they have finally found some “free speech” they’re concerned with protecting. They were never concerned with free speech on campus when it was conservatives trying to speak freely. They were never concerned when the federal government launched a pogrom against normal Americans who went to protest a bogus election and dared to walk through the Capitol that they own. Even now, Democrats are positively gleeful that Elon Musk’s participation in our government is being met by leftist-funded terrorists burning down Tesla stores. But this Hamas-sucking mutant who literally wants to murder you and your entire family? No, he’s got to be here. He’s got to get a free megaphone. He has every right to come here and destroy our country and kill your kids. Because of reasons and shut up, fascist.\n\nThat’s the Democrat position. But why do they hold such a manifestly politically unpopular position? Because that’s what the black, shriveled heart of the Democrat Party believes. And also because Donald Trump feels differently. One thing is for certain – Donald Trump’s superpower is in full effect, and right now, he’s laughing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow Kurt on Twitter @KurtSchlichter.

        "full_text": "Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced Wednesday that the agency will take 31 “historic actions” to roll back the Biden administration’s climate agenda in line with President Donald Trump’s executive order to “Unleash American Energy.”\n\n“By overhauling massive rules on the endangerment finding, the social cost of carbon and similar issues, we are driving a dagger through the heart of climate-change religion and ushering in America’s Golden Age,” Zeldin stated in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nZeldin said the actions will lower costs for things like purchasing a car, heating homes and operating businesses. Among the regulations Zeldin said the EPA would reconsider are the “illegal” Clean Power Plan 2.0., the endangerment finding, the electric vehicle mandate, and rules regarding particulate matter.\n\n“Today marks the death of the Green New Scam. The EPA recognizes that environmental protection and economic prosperity aren’t mutually exclusive goals,” Zeldin wrote in the Journal.\n\nHe also said the EPA would remain committed to a mission of protecting the environment, but not by shutting down power plants. Rather, he said, the EPA would protect the environment by making energy production cleaner and more efficient.\n\nBy reducing the regulatory impediments to industry, Zeldin said in an announcement posted on X, jobs would be created, especially in the auto industry.\n\n“From the campaign trail to day one and beyond, President Trump has delivered on his promise to unleash energy dominance and lower the cost of living. We at EPA will do our part to power the great American comeback,” Zeldin said.",

        "full_text": "Archimedes Banya will allow trans people at its monthly ladies-only and men-only nights, in a reversal of a recent policy that drew criticism and an investigation.\n\nThe full-nude Russian bathhouse in the Bayview announced the change Wednesday. The spa now asks attendees of its “Special Women’s Night” event “to keep their genitals covered” to respect the religious and cultural beliefs of women “who feel most comfortable in a space without visible genitals.”\n\n“We have come to the realization that the present moment is a critical time in history when people of transgender identity are in need of an abundance of support for their rights and freedoms,” the spa’s statement said.\n\nThe bathhouse’s policy is to be “inclusive of all people of transgender identity, for all women’s nights and men’s nights, provided that the person’s gender identity conforms to the night in question.”\n\nArchimedes Banya recently updated its policy for gender-specific nights to exclude trans people. The language on the ladies-only event listing initially said that only “BIOLOGICAL WOMEN” would be allowed, before being updated to “sex assigned at birth.”\n\nThe city’s Human Rights Commission last week began investigating the bathhouse for excluding trans people two days a month.\n\nResponses to the policy were mixed, with some saying the change was necessary for religious inclusivity. Banya staff defended the decision to exclude trans people and clarified that trans women would be allowed on a second women’s night.\n\nIn the statement Wednesday, the bathhouse said it stands by its original aim of supporting “the freedom and autonomy of women whose religious practices require a more restricted environment.”\n\n“We intended to provide this support as well as to provide inclusiveness of trans community members, by welcoming those of transgender identity on both inclusive women’s night and almost every other day of each month,” the spa said. “We see now that the word ‘almost’ in ‘almost every other day of the month’ is an opportunity to go further to support the transgender community.”",

        "full_text": "The founder of a women-only gym has found herself at the center of a social media storm—with both critics and supporters—after she walked-back her initial plans to include trans-female clients.\n\nNatalee Barnett, a 25-year-old fitness influencer from the U.K. with hundreds of thousands of followers across various platforms online, has been updating her \"nataleebfitness\" fans for years about her plan to open her own gym. She is currently preparing to open a venue in London called \"The Girls Spot\" catering specifically for women.\n\nFour years ago, in 2021, Barnett posted on X (formerly Twitter) to confirm that trans-women would also be welcome when she opened. However, on Sunday, she released a video statement on X saying her soon-to-open gym is now only \"for biological women.\" Her lengthy explanation, watched by more than 32 million viewers and shared more than 15,000 times, has been greeted with a mix of both fury and praise from X users.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to Barnett via her Instagram page seeking further information and comment on the furor.\n\nThe episode comes amid an increasingly bitter cultural debate about the rights of transgender people in society, particularly relating to their inclusion in women's sports and women-only spaces. Trans athletes, such as the swimmer Lia Thomas, have been accused of \"stealing\" podium wins from cisgender women who have not undergone male puberty. While Thomas's competitor-turned-activist Riley Gaines has also said that women being forced to change alongside transgender athletes who have male genitalia constitutes a form of sexual abuse.\n\nPresident Donald Trump recently enshrined his stance on the debate in law, by signing an executive order barring transgender female athletes from competing in women's or girls' sporting events.\n\nThe U.K. has been riven by similar debates about the role trans athletes should play in women's sport, so Barnett's gym has now found itself in the eye of the storm.\n\nBarnett revealed on X on February 2 that her long-time goal of opening a women's gym was set to become a reality this year. She shared photos of her posing outside The Girls Spot alongside an X post from 2021 when the then-21-year-old first outlined her plans to open her own gym.\n\nHowever, another post she shared in 2021 has also received renewed attention.\n\nFour years ago, Barnett had written that, \"respectfully, if you have a problem with trans women attending my gym then you can find another gym to train at. I have discussed this several times before, trans women are women and also a minority that need to be protected. Please keep your transphobia away.\"\n\nBut in an X post this weekend, the gym owner explained that she had changed her mind about the admittance of trans-women, writing: \"Addressing my tweet from 2021. The Girls Spot operates as a female-only gym for biological women, tackling harassment, sexual assault & violence that women face inside the gym. The tweet circling was made 4 years ago and I was in the very early stages of creating a concept.\"\n\nShe also attached a video in which she spoke directly to the camera to explain her reasoning. She told viewers the gym was designed to be a safe space for women who often suffer from sexual harassment at mixed gyms.\n\nShe also said she has now had several years to work out exactly what she wants her venue to provide, saying that \"the meaning of The Girls Spot gym is now entirely different.\" She added: \"Whilst we are a gym, inside we are focusing on self defense classes, Muay Thai, boxing classes, as well as workshops and activations around PCOS [polycystic ovary syndrome] and training on your menstrual cycle, all of which occur to biological women.\"\n\nAddressing my tweet from 2021.The Girls Spot operates as a female-only gym for biological women, tackling harassment, sexual assault & violence that women face inside the gym.The tweet circling was made 4 years ago and I was in the very early stages of creating a concept. pic.twitter.com/R4i6iUCMLA\n\nLater in the video, she stressed: \"We do believe that everybody deserves a safe space and there are many gyms that are starting to have mixed cubicles in changing rooms so that individuals can feel safer and more included in these environments. But The Girls Spot gym as a standalone is a female-only gym because it is imperative that I stick to the vision and the mission and ensure that these women feel safe.\"\n\nA follow-up X post added: \"I believe trans women and other individuals deserve safe spaces too, that hasn't changed.\"\n\nBarnett's decision on the membership of her gym sparked both delight and despair among internet commentators.\n\nOne X user, whose profile said she is an \"adult human female,\" said: \"THANK YOU for standing up for biological women and girls this way. May your business thrive.\"\n\nBut another commentator, whose profile says they are \"nonbinary writer,\" said: \"I hope your gym fails honestly. How you creating a 'safe space' but excluding the most vulnerable? (sic)\"\n\nAnd others questioned how Barnett would enforce her policy and wondered who would be affected by that.\n\nOne X user, who described themselves as a 23-year-old \"fat\" person, said: \"how do you intend to police that in a way that is not incredibly invasive?\"\n\nWhile another added: \"what do the logistics ACTUALLY look like ? checking private parts at the door ??? when muscular c!s [cisgender] women who don't look 'woman enough' want to come what then ? when those women experience discrimination from other women trying to transinvestigate, what then ?? as a business woman, i'm interested to see how you imagine this working.\"\n\nBarnett has set up a pink-themed website for The Girls Spot, which is set to open in the spring. Would-be clients are invited to sign up to the waiting to list to \"become a founding member,\" where they can \"feel safe, protected, and inspired to thrive in a space built just for you.\"",

        "full_text": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said that the government will deport lawful permanent residents who support Hamas and came to the U.S. as students with an intent “to rile up all kinds of anti-Jewish student, antisemitic activities,” referencing the Palestinian rights protests at universities in 2024.\n\n“And if you end up having a green card – not citizenship, but a green card – as a result of that visa while you’re here and those activities, we’re going to kick you out. It’s as simple as that. This is not about free speech. This is about people that don’t have a right to be in the United States to begin with,” Rubio said on March 12, 2025.\n\nThat policy has now ensnared Mahmoud Khalil, a recent graduate of Columbia University and a leader in the Palestinian rights protest movement at the school. Khalil, a Palestinian who was born in Syria, faces deportation after he was arrested on March 8, 2025, in New York City. The Department of Homeland Security said that the secretary of state had determined Khalil’s presence or activities in the country posed “serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”\n\nKhalil entered the U.S. on a student visa in 2022. In 2024, he received a green card and became a lawful permanent resident – meaning he has the legal right to work and stay in the U.S. There are an estimated 12.8 million lawful permanent residents in the country.\n\nKhalil’s lawyers say that his arrest and pending deportation are unconstitutional.\n\nIn many respects, the rights of lawful permanent residents and citizens are similar. Yet citizens and lawful permanent residents do not enjoy equal status under the law.\n\nThe Supreme Court and other courts recognize that lawful permanent residents have First Amendment rights to free speech.\n\nYet the Supreme Court upheld deporting lawful permanent residents in the 1950s based on their political activity, in particular membership in the Communist Party.\n\nSo, while lawful permanent residents may not be criminally prosecuted for their political speech or activity, what they say or write may well affect their ability to remain in the U.S., if the government determines that they are a security risk.\n\nI’m a scholar of immigration law. Here are three major differences between the rights of citizens and lawful permanent residents.\n\n1. Limited political rights\n\nLawful permanent residents are people born in other countries who can legally work and live in the U.S. for as long as they like. They may enlist in the U.S. armed forces, apply to become U.S. citizens, and are legally protected against discrimination by private employers.\n\nStates also generally cannot discriminate against lawful permanent residents – though states may require certain groups of people, such as teachers or police, to have U.S. citizenship.\n\nBetween 1820 and 1920, noncitizens routinely participated in different aspects of government, including voting, holding office and jury service in many states and territories.\n\nThese days, states and the federal government generally allow only citizens to serve on juries, hold political positions and vote. With a few exceptions, such as voting in some local elections, permanent residents are not able to do any of these things.\n\n2. Limited public benefits\n\nThe distinction between noncitizens and citizens extends to other areas of life, such as public benefits.\n\nThe Supreme Court has frequently stated, “In the exercise of its broad power over naturalization and immigration, Congress regularly makes rules that would be unacceptable if applied to citizens.”\n\nIn practice, this means that the federal government – and to a much lesser extent, states – do not offer public benefits, such as Medicaid and other kinds of government support, to lawful permanent residents and other noncitizens on the same basis as citizens.\n\nFor example, lawful permanent residents must generally wait five years before becoming eligible for certain programs intended to support low-income people, such as Supplemental Security Income and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\n\n3. Reversal of immigration status\n\nFinally, unlike citizens, lawful permanent residents can lose their legal immigration status.\n\nCongress has enacted many grounds for deporting a noncitizen, or stopping them from entering the country.\n\nSome courts have found that the U.S. government can deport a lawful permanent resident because of national security or terrorism concerns, even if the person has not committed a crime.\n\nThe Trump administration argues that they can deport lawful permanent residents like Khalil under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, which states that a lawful permanent resident can be deported if the secretary of state has reasonable ground to believe that this person “would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”\n\nThe Trump administration had initiated deportation proceedings against Khalil on this ground.\n\nU.S. law also provides that any non-citizen can be deported if the secretary of state and the attorney general jointly determine that the person is associated with terrorism, or poses a threat to the U.S. In addition, the law says an immigrant can be deported if they “endorse or espouse terrorist activity or persuades others” to endorse or espouse terrorist activity or support a terrorist organization.\n\nStill, lawful permanent residents are entitled to certain basic rights, such as retaining a lawyer to represent them in administrative hearings and court before they are deported.\n\nBy contrast, the U.S. government cannot deport a U.S. citizen for any reason. However, sometimes U.S. citizens are deported by mistake.\n\nIndeed, the Supreme Court has found that while it is constitutional to execute a military member for desertion in wartime, it would be cruel and unusual punishment to deprive them of citizenship.\n\nLegal grounds for deporting noncitizens\n\nThere have been few recent court cases testing the scope of deporting lawful permanent residents on national security grounds based on pure speech.\n\nIn 1999, the Supreme Court ruled that if a person is deportable, they are deportable – even if there is some other reason that motivated the government’s deportation proceedings, such as a suspicion that the non-citizen is involved with crime or terrorism.\n\nThe Supreme Court also then held that the government could deport non-citizens for technical visa violations, even if the case was based on the government’s belief that the non-citizens were associated with a terrorist group.\n\nThere is also some precedent arguing that deportation based on “adverse foreign policy consequences” is too broad and nonspecific to be constitutional.\n\nIndeed, Marianne Trump Barry, the sister of the president, held this opinion when she was a federal judge in the mid-1990s. But Samuel Alito, then an appeals court judge, overturned Barry’s ruling on procedural grounds in 1996.\n\nFor its part, the Supreme Court has occasionally held that very broad and indeterminate deportation grounds are “void for vagueness,” meaning so sweeping and imprecise that they are unconstitutional.",

        "full_text": "A federal judge on Wednesday halted parts of President Donald Trump’s executive order that targeted a Democratic-linked law firm.\n\nUS District Judge Beryl Howell sided with the firm Perkins Coie, which represented Hillary Clinton in 2016 and has been involved in election litigation that Trump opposed.\n\nHowell granted the firm’s request for a temporary restraining order for some sections of Trump’s order. The parts being blocked include its limitations on government contracts with clients of the firm and the potential restrictions it puts on the firm’s employees, such as bans on hiring those employees for government positions or barring their access to federal buildings.\n\nThe executive order, Howell said as she read her opinion in court for more than 30 minutes, is “a punishment for a singled-out entity being disloyal.”\n\nWhen “the Queen of Hearts yells ‘off with their heads’ for her subjects,” Howell added, that “cannot be the reality we are living under.”\n\nThe judge, an appointee of President Barack Obama, said the case also touches on larger tests of Trump’s executive authority. The executive order, she said, is an unconstitutional use of “taxpayer dollars and government resources … to pursue a personal vendetta.”\n\n“The president is certainly entitled to his own beliefs, entitled to his own causes, and entitled to his own dislikes,” Howell said. But the president cannot “bring the federal government down on his political opponents … as he has done here.”\n\n‘Chilling effect’ to legal system\n\nThe judge also said she was blocking much of Trump’s order because of the economic harm it would cause to the law firm — and the intimidating message it sent across legal industry.\n\nHowell said the order was an “extreme, unprecedented effort” and had an effect of “blizzard proportions across the legal profession.”\n\nDelivering her decision from the bench, Howell said the justice system depends on zealous advocates on all sides being able to argue for their clients.\n\n“The chilling effect of this executive order, 14230, threatens to significantly undermine the integrity of our entire legal system,” she said.\n\nDOJ argues Trump should be trusted without question\n\nThe ruling came at the end of a hearing where the top aide to the attorney general argued that the president should be trusted without question if he wants to blacklist or sanction businesses or people as he sees fit across the country.\n\nThe argument from Chad Mizelle, the chief of staff to Attorney General Pam Bondi, is one of staggering presidential power.\n\nHowell was flabbergasted by Mizelle’s argument, saying it sent “chills down my spine” to hear the president could bar all government business with a particular company or person. Howell compared that type of decision by the president to Treasury Department economic sanctions that are decided by the Office of Foreign Assets Control related to national security.\n\n“Your view is, ‘Don’t be chilled, judge. You can just trust the president to draw the right line, and yes, he has that power?’” Howell asked. “And that’s the government’s position here?”\n\n“100 percent,” Mizelle said. “The president has every right to take that action.”\n\nMizelle also argued the courts shouldn’t be able to limit the president’s authority, especially as he decides upon lawyers’ security clearances or other access questions related to national security.\n\nPerkins Coie’s lawyer Dane Butswinkas, however, said that the national security argument is a red herring, and the Trump administration’s approach refers to “a different Constitution from the one I’m familiar with.”\n\nThe firm says the order will cause top clients to drop its lawyers, and ultimately “will spell the end of the law firm,” Butswinkas said. “The president is punishing this law firm” for defending free speech.\n\nHe said that Justice Department prosecutors have canceled meetings with Perkins Coie lawyers, hurting their ability to represent clients in ongoing legal matters.\n\nHowell also said she was blocking Trump’s order because it appears to violate several Constitutional protections, including the right for defendants to choose their lawyers, and the First Amendment right to petition the government. Perkins Coie also had no warning of the executive order or chance to oppose it before the White House issued it last Thursday, violating their due process, the judge added.\n\nCNN’s Emily R. Condon and Hannah Rabinowitz contributed to this report.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.",

        "full_text": "Overwhelming majorities of Los Angeles County voters support strengthening building codes and imposing greater restrictions on home construction in high-risk areas following January’s devastating Palisades and Eaton fires, according to a new poll from the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies, co-sponsored by The Times.\n\nEighty percent of those polled backed tougher building codes to make homes more fire resistant even if doing so added to costs. Seven out of 10 wanted more regulations to curb homebuilding in wildfire-prone neighborhoods.\n\n“This is a huge event in L.A. history,” said Mark DiCamillo, poll director at UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies. “It’s having a major effect on what people think needs to be done in terms of making housing safer.”\n\nAlmost 13,000 households were displaced by the two fires, which destroyed structures on 56% of properties in Pacific Palisades and nearly half of those in Altadena.\n\nEven though implementing more robust building codes and restrictions on growth could affect Palisades and Altadena homeowners directly, voters polled in those communities supported both ideas by wide margins.\n\nBacking for stronger building codes in the Palisades and Eaton fire zones, 85% and 82% respectively in favor, eclipsed support from those outside the areas. For homebuilding limits, 65% of voters in the Palisades fire zone were supportive, as were 61% of those surveyed in the Eaton area.\n\nThese two issues are weighing heavily in Tracey Alexander’s mind as she decides whether to rebuild the home she lost in the Palisades fire.\n\nAlexander and her husband have lived for nearly three decades in the Palisades’ Alphabet Streets, a mostly flat residential area with smaller lots than in the hills. She said that she and all her neighbors would want to build back with more fire safe materials, but no one knew how much more expensive that would be. The other question she’s wrestling with is more existential.\n\n“Part of it is the economics of rebuilding,” Alexander said. “Part of it is, ‘Do I want to live in a fire zone?’ That’s something that is hard to analyze.”\n\nState and local officials have yet to decide if there will be any building code changes for rebuilt homes. Current codes for new and rebuilt properties in high-risk fire zones require significant measures, including ignition-resistant materials and multipaned or window upgrades.\n\nThe Berkeley IGS poll found broad backing for a number of policy ideas, including those that would increase taxes to pay for fire protection and build higher-density housing in urban areas.\n\nThe most popular proposal, with 84% support, was for policymakers to prioritize assistance for low- and middle-income families displaced by the fires. Pacific Palisades had some of the highest home values in Los Angeles, and those in Altadena were above the county’s median. But that’s not always indicative of fire victims’ economic status. In many cases, homes worth more than $1 million prior to the fires were purchased for less than half that amount decades ago. Additionally, a quarter of the homes lost were apartments, other multifamily housing or mobile homes.\n\nNearly two-thirds of voters polled wanted to provide greater funding for city and county fire departments even if that meant raising taxes. Voters were more evenly divided, 46% support versus 43% opposed, about the idea of creating a tax structure that would require those living in high-risk fire areas to pay more for public services.\n\n“Right now, the priority for Los Angeles residents is fire protection,” DiCamillo said. “If they’re going to support tax hikes, that’s the area.”\n\nTo compensate for restricting homebuilding in fire-prone communities, county voters backed greater production of high-density housing in urban areas, with 55% support compared to 30% opposition.\n\nThe twin findings — restraining construction in riskier neighborhoods and promoting it in safer ones — mirror prior surveys.\n\nA 2019 Berkeley IGS poll saw support from three-quarters of California voters, including 79% in L.A. County, for imposing limits on growth in wildfire areas. A poll last year from the Los Angeles Business Council Institute found 81% of city voters backed speeding approvals for apartment buildings with some affordable housing near public transit and existing high-density, urban areas.\n\nMost policy proposals did not see significant splits among age, race, gender or other demographic factors, though there were large partisan differences in the level of support for many ideas. Still, a majority of GOP voters — traditionally leery of regulation — surveyed also backed strengthening building codes and imposing more restrictions on development in high-risk neighborhoods.\n\nOne policy idea that voters disliked in the poll was allowing insurance companies to increase their rates if it enables them to offer fire coverage more broadly. More than half of those surveyed were opposed to the idea, compared to 39% in support.\n\nInsurance coverage has emerged as one of the highest-profile issues in the immediate wake of the fires. Last month, state Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara turned down a 22% emergency rate hike proposed by State Farm General, California’s largest home insurer, as the company and others have questioned whether they will remain in the state due to risks.\n\n“I can imagine insurance rates are going to be near the top of voters’ minds when it comes to cost and affordability of living in California,” DiCamillo said. “That’s where the resistance really is coming from.”\n\nThe Berkeley IGS poll was conducted online in English and Spanish on Feb. 17-26 among 5,184 registered voters in Los Angeles County. The survey’s estimated margin of error is 2 percentage points, and larger for demographic subgroups.",

The synthetic opioid drug is wrapped in foil, sealed in plastic, then dropped with an oily splash into the petrol tank of the trafficker's nondescript car.\n\nJay, not his real name, had crossed earlier from the US to this cartel-run safe house on the Mexican side of the border. The house looks like any other in this neighbourhood. We are told to drive in quickly and an iron gate closes firmly behind us. They don't cook the drug here, but still they are wary of attracting attention. The men all speak in hushed voices and work quickly.\n\nTheir lethal business has become the centre of a global economic dispute. The White House has used fentanyl smuggling through US borders as a key justification for raising tariffs on other nations. US President Donald Trump has also vowed to \"wage war\" on the drug cartels.\n\nThe BBC gained rare access to a cartel's operation along the border and travelled to the US to meet their ultimate customers, to see if the international row was doing anything to halt the illegal flow of narcotics.\n\nThe men we meet at the safe house are foot-soldiers of a well-known cartel. Two of them loading the car admit to fleeting moments of remorse. But when I ask the man packing the drugs into the fuel tank if he feels guilty about the deaths the pills cause, he sniggers. \"We have family too, of course we feel guilty. But if I stop, it's going to continue. It's not my problem,\" he tells me with a shrug.\n\nThe men keep their faces covered while they remove the back seat of the car to gain access to the tank, taking care not to spill petrol. The smell inside the car could alert customs officers on the other side of the border that the fuel tank has been tampered with.\n\nThe light green pills, 5,000 in total and marked with an M, are packed tightly - a fraction of what Jay says he sells every week in LA and across the American northwest.\n\n\"I try to get 100,000 pills a week, every week,\" the softly spoken dealer tells me. \"I don't send them in one vehicle. I try to spread it in different cars. That way I minimise my risk of losing all my pills.\"\n\nA 25% tariff on all goods from Mexico was introduced in response to what President Donald Trump said was the unacceptable flow of illegal drugs and illegal immigrants into the US. Some of those tariffs have since been delayed until 2 April.\n\nDefeating the fentanyl trade is one of President Trump's top policy goals, but Jay doesn't rate his chances.\n\n\"Last time he was in office, he tried to do the same thing, and it never happened. There's always going to be a demand. And where's the biggest demand? United States, lucky for us. We're here in the border,\" says Jay with a smile.\n\nThere is so much of the drug flowing into the US, most of it coming from Mexico, that according to Jay the price he sells it for in LA has fallen from about $5 or $6 per pill a year ago, to $1.50 now (£1.16).\n\nMexican police say cartels switched in a big way to fentanyl, which is 50 times more potent than heroin, because unlike other opiates - which are made from the opium poppy - it is completely synthetic and much easier to make and transport.\n\nFentanyl's strength and addictiveness has left a deep scar on American society: drug overdoses kill more people in the US than guns or car crashes. Fatalities have started to decline, perhaps due in part to the greater availability of Naloxone, a drug that reverses the effects of overdoses of opioids. But the latest figures are still stark: 87,000 overdose deaths (mostly from opioids) from October 2023 to September 2024, down from 114,000 the year before.\n\nIn an attempt to stave off punitive tariffs from the White House, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has pledged to send 10,000 National Guard troops to the border. The government has made more than 900 arrests since October in Sinaloa, a major drug trafficking hub. Back in December, Mexico announced its biggest ever fentanyl seizure in the state: more than a tonne of pills. In fact, the country has seized more fentanyl in the past five months than it did in the previous year.\n\nMexico has also made it harder to import a key ingredient of fentanyl from China, prompting cartels to reduce the strength of each pill - and, in the process, making them less deadly.\n\nAnd at the end of February, 29 senior drug cartel figures were handed over to the United States, including members of five of the six Mexican crime syndicates that President Trump's administration recently designated as terrorist organisations.\n\nPresident Sheinbaum also said she had agreed to the CIA increasing surveillance drone operations over Mexican territory in search of fentanyl drugs labs, after the media revealed the covert missions.\n\nJay acknowledges the dangers of his trade to himself and his customers, but is untroubled.\n\n\"They always try to blame us, that we are the ones that are poisoning American citizens. But they're the biggest users.\"\n\nHe coolly insulates himself from responsibility and guilt for the deaths his drugs cause. He claims not to know anyone who has died using his product. \"I only deal with other suppliers,\" he tells me.\n\nThe cartels mostly use American citizens to courier their drugs across the border, as they are less likely to be stopped by US Customs and Border Protection. The driver, who goes by the name Charlie, has a US passport. He, too, is mostly indifferent to the suffering the fentanyl epidemic has caused.\n\n\"I need the money,\" he says. When I ask him how many times he has made the drugs run, he replies: \"Too many.\" (I later learn that the 5,000 pills in the fuel tank made it across the border without incident.)\n\nPresident Sheinbaum has also recently emphasised the demand side of the crisis, saying the US fentanyl crisis began with the legal but \"irresponsible approval\" of painkillers, such as OxyContin, starting in the late 1990s. \"The US government should take responsibility for the opioid-consumption crisis that has caused so many deaths,\" she said at a daily news conference.\n\nOn the other side of the border is Derek Maltz, who has spent a lifetime in US drug enforcement. He has been made the interim leader of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and spoke to me just before his appointment.\n\n\"The Mexican cartels need to know that we're coming down there,\" he tells me. \"We're going to have aggressive operations to go after you and your business because you are killing our American kids at record levels and it's not going to be tolerated.\"\n\nMr Maltz agrees, though, that targeting the cartels alone will not solve the opioid crisis. \"The cartels are very bad guys,\" he tells me. \"They're transnational criminals. They're narco-terrorists. However, there is a bad demand problem in America, we have to address why our population is turning to drugs for help.\"\n\nIn Philadelphia's Kensington neighbourhood - dubbed the largest open-air drugs market on the US east coast - Rosalind Pichardo of Operation Save Our City is on to her second Bible. She records in the book's back pages the number of times she has reversed an opioid overdose using the quick-acting drug Naloxone.\n\nFor the past six years, the figure totals 2,931. She flicks through the pages and that number written in red comes alive with the memories of the individuals she saved, and the ones she lost.\n\nShe begins to list: \"Male in his 60s… male 30s… female in her 30s, very thin, no hair.\" Beside each name in this roll-call of fentanyl victims, is the number of doses of Naloxone - sold under the name Narcan - she used to attempt to revive people.\n\nMs Pichardo, who runs a drop-in centre called Sunshine House, operates what she calls a \"no-judgement zone\". She bristles at the terms like \"addict\", \"junkie\" or \"zombie\", which have been used to describe the people of her neighbourhood. Instead, she calls everyone \"sunshine\".\n\nSome she doesn't remember; others she will never forget.\n\n\"Look at this one, seven years old, two Narcans,\" she points out. Ms Pichardo had been called to a neighbour's house where a woman was holding in her arms a child who had turned blue. Ms Pichardo went inside and the girl was placed on the floor, but as she entered the child's father ran upstairs carrying a bag. \"I'm thinking if that was my child, I'd be running to help the child,\" she recalls.\n\nAt first, she thought it might be epilepsy, but she spotted drug scales and plastic baggies on a nearby table. The kid's dad was a drug dealer; the seven-year-old had been poisoned by his stash and overdosed. \"I was livid,\" she says.\n\nThose two doses of Narcan were enough to save the child's life.\n\nOn another page, a woman, six months pregnant, two doses of Narcan. She also survived.\n\nIn Kensington, drugs are cheap and plentiful, and people shoot up in the open. As she walks the neighbourhood, Ms Pichardo finds people passed out on the pavement, a woman in a stupor with her trousers down, a man lying prone next to a metro turnstile, another man in a wheelchair, his eyes closed and money in his hands.\n\nHe, like a growing number of opioid users, has had a limb amputated. A new drug on the street, the animal tranquilliser Xylazine, is being mixed with fentanyl. It leads to open wounds which become infected. The air is rank in places.\n\nJohn White is 56 years old, and for 40 of those years he has struggled with addiction. At Sunshine House, Ms Pichardo serves him a bowl of homemade soup.\n\n\"I've been in this city all my life,\" he says. \"The fentanyl and opioid epidemic is the worst I've ever seen. Fentanyl will get you so hooked that you have to get more. So they put it in everything.\"\n\nMr White had a fentanyl overdose after smoking a joint laced with the drug: it is being added to all kinds of illicit drugs, including heroin, cocaine and marijuana.\n\nMs Pichardo holds out little hope that even if the fentanyl trade is cut off from Mexico, it will improve people's lives in Kensington.\n\n\"The problem that we have with the war on drugs is - it didn't work then [and] I don't believe it's going to work now,\" she explains.\n\nWhen the supply of one drug is cut off, another replaces it, she says. \"Once there was heroin, now there's no more. Now there's fentanyl. When there's no fentanyl, now it's going to be Xylazine. So it's like they'll find a way to keep people addicted so that people can make money off of people, off the suffering of people,\" says Ms Pichardo.\n\nDirectly across from Sunshine House, a young woman is found collapsed on the pavement, her body splayed across the concrete: she's unresponsive. Ms Pichardo is quickly on the scene, her medical kit by her side, yet again administering Naloxone. The woman is eventually revived - she will survive.\n\nRoz Pichardo returns to Sunshine House, another life saved and another digit to be added to the back pages of her tattered Bible.\n\nTop picture: Darren Conway, BBC",

        "full_text": "(NewsNation) — A judge heard arguments Wednesday about the arrest of a former Columbia University student who helped lead pro-Palestinian protests on campus.\n\nMahmoud Khalil, born in Syria and raised in a Palestinian refugee camp, holds legal permanent resident status in the United States. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested Khalil on Saturday and transferred him to a detention center in Louisiana.\n\nKhalil will remain detained in Louisiana until at least next week following the initial court hearing in New York on Wednesday over the Trump administration’s plans to deport him for his role in campus protests against Israel.\n\nThe hearing focused on jurisdictional issues after Khalil, 30, was moved to the detention center in the South.\n\nGovernment attorneys want his case decided in New Jersey or Louisiana, while his lawyers seek to return it to New York and have him released under supervision.\n\nKhalil’s wife, a U.S. citizen who is eight months pregnant, attended the hearing. His legal team claims they have been unable to contact him since his detention and later accused the administration of violating his free speech rights.\n\nThe hearing is the first challenge to President Donald Trump’s January executive order prohibiting antisemitism on college campuses and using that as justification for deportation.\n\nAccording to Khalil’s lawyer, Amy Greer, ICE officers said his student visa was revoked under Trump’s executive order. When Khalil showed them he was not in the country on a student visa but rather as a legal permanent resident, the officers said that was also revoked, Greer said.\n\n“I think we ought to get them all out of the country,” Trump said about Khalil’s arrest Tuesday. “They’re troublemakers, they’re agitators. They don’t love our country. We ought to get them the hell out. I think that guy — I heard his statements too. They were plenty bad, and I think we had to get him the hell out of the country.”\n\nTrump’s border czar Tom Homan, on a Wednesday trip to the New York state Capitol, said Khalil was arrested because there are “limitations” to free speech.\n\n“I hear freedom of speech, freedom of speech, freedom of speech. Can you stand in a movie theater and yell ‘fire’? Can you slander somebody verbally? Free speech has limitations,” Homan said.\n\nKhalil’s lawyer argues that ICE’s actions violate his First Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nA federal judge in Manhattan blocked Khalil’s deportation earlier this week. Khalil is a green card holder, which allows him due process rights under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nWhat did Mahmoud Khalil do during the Columbia protests?\n\nKhalil finished his requirements for a Columbia master’s degree in December.\n\nColumbia became the center of a U.S. pro-Palestinian protest movement that swept across college campuses nationwide last year and led to more than 2,000 arrests.\n\nHe acted as a spokesperson for Columbia protesters and hasn’t been charged with a crime. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that the administration moved to deport him under a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that gives the secretary of state the power to deport a noncitizen on foreign policy grounds.\n\nCan ICE take away Mahmoud Khalil’s green card?\n\nKhalil was one of the most visible activists at Columbia University’s pro-Palestinian rallies in 2024. The Department of Homeland Security has accused him of “leading activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.”\n\nThe agency is sanctioned to initiate deportation proceedings against green card holders for a broad range of alleged criminal activity.\n\nBut according to immigration experts, the detention of a legal permanent resident who has not been charged with a crime marked an extraordinary move with an uncertain legal foundation.\n\n“I would gather that anyone that has a political view or has protested and also has a green card would be nervous,” Rosanna Berardi, managing partner at Berardi Immigration Law, told NewsNation.\n\n“If this is any indication of the administration’s position on green card holders that their own agency vetted at a super-high level and gave a green card … and this is the behavior of the administration, I would be gravely concerned,” Berardi said.\n\nNewsNation has reached out to Khalil’s lawyer, the Justice Department, DHS and Columbia University for comment but has not yet heard back.\n\nMahmoud Khalil case first ‘of many to come’\n\nTrump himself said Khalil’s arrest was the first of many during his second term. The administration is not only targeting students who participated in protests but also the universities themselves.\n\nThe Department of Education sent letters to 60 universities warning they were under investigation for alleged antisemitic discrimination and harassment for allowing pro-Palestinian protests to occur on school grounds.\n\nFollowing the letters, the University of California, Los Angeles — the site of a large pro-Khalil protest Tuesday — announced it is starting a new initiative to combat antisemitism on campus.\n\nThe Trump administration has already canceled $400 million worth of grants to Columbia University as of Friday. The school’s response to pro-Palestinian protests on its New York City campus was explicitly cited as the reason behind the funding changes.\n\nHarvard University announced a faculty and staff hiring freeze Monday due to “substantial financial uncertainties driven by rapidly shifting federal policies.”\n\nDetaining of Columbia grad is suppression of First Amendment: Geraldo Rivera\n\nGeraldo Rivera argued that moving Khalil to Louisiana reveals the government’s true motives in the case.\n\n“The fact that they secreted him off to Louisiana, of all places, in the dark of night really reveals the motive of ICE and the federal agents — they want to silence this person,” Rivera said.\n\nRivera also acknowledged concerns about antisemitism on college campuses since October 7, calling it a “vile kind of confrontation” and “harassment of Jewish students.” However, he characterized the government’s handling of Khalil’s case as “ham-handed” and problematic.\n\n“This really looks bad. It looks as if they’re trying to suppress his First Amendment rights,” Rivera said.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters that Khalil’s case is “not about free speech.”\n\n“This is about people that don’t have a right to be in the United States to begin with. No one has a right to a student visa. No one has a right to a green card,” Rubio said.\n\nRivera pushed back, saying there’s “absolutely zero evidence that this particular person screamed anything at anybody, blocked anybody from anything, behaved in any way that would violate either local laws or federal law.”\n\nRivera, who identified himself as a supporter of Israel, said, “I’m a Zionist, but still, I’m also an American, and I’m proud of my Constitution, and I abhor this attempt to silence this person.”\n\n“If you’re so confident in your case, why is he in Louisiana?” Rivera asked. “What connection does this case add to Louisiana other than the fact that you want to inconvenience anyone who wants to talk to him and keep him in isolation?”\n\nNewsNation’s Damita Menezes and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

        "full_text": "Authored by Paul D. Thacker via The DisInformation Chronicle,\n\nI had the pleasure of being contacted by Reuters Fact Check last week, with a demand that I explain and justify a headline on a story I wrote about COVID vaccines. I immediately started laughing.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, I should probably explain Reuters Fact Check first.\n\nReuters Fact Check is one of the many disreputable fact-check organizations that Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg cut ties with in January because, in his words, “The fact checkers have been too politically biased and destroyed more trust than they created, especially in the US.” At the time, Zuckerberg cut financial links with Reuters Fact Check and about two-thirds of the entire fact checking industry.\n\nZuckerberg began to change his tune about fact checking last May after House Republicans released Meta’s internal communications. Zuckerberg and other Meta executive were exposed complaining in texts and emails that the Biden White House pressured them to censor COVID topics, and they discussed fact checkers falsely labeling some posts as false.\n\nReuters launched their fact checking initiative in partnership with Meta back in 2020, claiming in a press release, “Reuters has a superior track record in sourcing, verifying and clearing user-generated content for distribution to thousands of clients globally and we are best placed in using our in-house expertise to fact check social media content.”\n\nWell, not really. Like all the fact check organizations, Reuters fact checks narratives, not facts. But before getting into any details, let’s wind the clock back to 2022 when Dr. Kerryn Phelps testified before the Australian Parliament about her COVID vaccine injury.\n\n“Regulators of the medical profession have censored public discussion about adverse events following immunisation,” Phelps testified, “with threats to doctors not to make any public statements about anything that ‘might undermine the government’s vaccine rollout’ or risk suspension or loss of their registration.”\n\nLaying out the details of how the COVID vaccine harmed her and her wife, Phelps explained that medical professionals dismissed vaccine injury, a point driven home by the venue for her testimony: an Australian government inquiry, not on vaccine injury, but on Long COVID. Phelps’ credentials made it hard for fact checkers and pharma friendly reporters to shoot her down. She is a conjoint professor at the NICM Health Research Institute, the first woman elected president of the Australian Medical Association (AMA), and a former member of the Australian Parliament.\n\nWhat became clear at the time, however, is that people injured by the COVID vaccine would only be taken seriously if they discussed their symptoms as a type of Long COVID. A group of Australian patients injured by the COVID vaccine called COVERSE submitted testimony to Australian Parliament that adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines could be mistaken for Long COVID, given significant overlap in symptoms.\n\nThis second point was further underlined in Brianne Dressen’s book Worth a Shot?: Secrets of the Clinical Trial Participant Who Inspired a Global Movement. Dressen recounts participating in a U.S. COVID vaccine clinical trial only to be vaccine injured. Some of her story was documented in a Science Magazine article on the NIH’s investigation of COVID vaccine injuries.\n\nDressen later founded the advocacy group, React 19, for patients harmed by COVID vaccine, and describes in her book how many vaccine injured patients are misdiagnosed with Long COVID.\n\nDressen is also one of the 28 authors on the preprint I covered that discussed patients who had been harmed by the COVID vaccine: “Yale Researchers Find COVID Spike Protein in Blood 709 Days After Vaccination, Positing Millions of Long COVID Patients May Actually Be Vaccine Injured.”\n\nMy headline triggered an anonymous writer for Reuters Fact Check to contact me demanding an explanation:\n\nThe senior authors of the paper and independent experts we consulted all refuted that claim, saying there is no such evidence or conclusion in the study.\n\nWe wanted to offer you the opportunity to comment on whether you stand by your article and, if possible, to point us to any evidence in the paper that supports your assertion.\n\nI started laughing at first, as Reuters Fact Check has a tattered history with numerous fact checks undermined by scientific research as well as the very Yale study they were citing and that I had reported on. Here’s how I responded to Reuters in email:\n\nMY EMAIL TO REUTERS:\n\nReuters Fact Check falsely asserted, “The mRNA instructs cells to make the [spike] protein and is broken down by the body shortly thereafter” although the new study found “spike in circulation up to 709 days after vaccination.” When does Reuters Fact Check plan to correct this falsehood in accordance with what is reported in this new study?\n\nReuters Fact Check asserted, “There is no proof that spike proteins created in response to mRNA vaccines are harmful to the body.” However, the new study reported:\n\nInteraction with full-length S, its subunits (S1, S2), and/or peptide fragments with host molecules may result in prolonged symptoms in certain individuals. Recently, a subset of non-classical monocytes has been shown to harbor S protein in patients with PVS. Further, biodistribution studies on mRNA–LNP platforms in animal models indicate its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, and the local S expression could result in neurocognitive symptoms.\n\nWhen does Reuters Fact Check plan to correct this falsehood in accordance with what is reported in this new study?\n\nI spoke for several hours on background with one of the paper's 28 authors, so who is Reuters Fact Check speaking with?\n\nDid you notice that each time I caught Reuters with a fake fact check, their mistakes always favored the pharmaceutical industry? Well, Reuters Fact Check never responded to me. Instead, Reuters posted a fake fact check that never bothered to quote anything I sent them. Nor did Reuters go back and correct their fake fact checks from the past. And their fake headline attacked something that was never claimed.\n\nNobody I’m aware of, nor anyone I have spoken with thinks “Long COVID is a vaccine injury” as Reuters falsely contends. But with tens of millions of Americans reported to have Long COVID, some subset of these patients are likely vaccine injured.\n\nReuters Fact Check simply made up a claim, debunked it, and proclaimed victory. This is exactly how another former Meta fact checker, Leadstories.com, behaved when they did a fake fact check of a BMJ investigation that exposed problems with Pfizer’s COVID clinical trial.\n\nI spoke to Dr. Danice Hertz, another of the study authors, to get her views on fake fact checks and why so many medical professionals have politicized the issue of vaccines. “Up until this moment, vaccine injury was not acknowledged,” Hertz told me. “And there’s been a concerted effort to cover it up.”\n\nA couple weeks after Zuckerberg cut ties in January with biased fact checkers like Reuters, he sat for an interview with Joe Rogan and complained that Meta was pressured to censor anything on vaccine side effects.\n\n“Who’s pressuring you take down things that talk about vaccine side effects,” Rogan asked.",

        "full_text": "“Our caucus is unified” on such a measure to “keep the government open and give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan legislation that can pass,” Mr. Schumer said in a brief statement from the floor.\n\nThe announcement left congressional leaders without a clear path to avert a shutdown that would begin at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday should Congress fail to act by then to extend federal funding. Senate Republicans would need the support of at least eight Democrats to overcome procedural hurdles and bring a spending measure to a final vote. Just one, Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, has so far declared he would vote to break any filibuster.\n\nThe standoff puts Senate Democrats at risk of being blamed for any shutdown even as they complain about Trump administration disruptions to federal agencies. But they are under pressure from House Democrats and activists to stand against Mr. Trump and Elon Musk as they lead an effort to dismantle broad swaths of the federal bureaucracy, in some cases in direct defiance of Congress, which holds the power of the purse.\n\nWith two days left before the shutdown deadline, there is still time for a reversal by Democrats. But most of them have heaped criticism on Republicans’ stopgap spending measure, arguing that it would give Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk too much leeway to continue their unilateral efforts to slash government employees and programs.\n\nRepublicans, who control both chambers, have shown no willingness to compromise with Democrats on the spending measure. And even if they agreed to, changing the House bill or approving a different one would require the House to return and vote again, which is highly unlikely. Republican leaders deliberately adjourned the chamber on Tuesday night and left town after passing the spending legislation, known as a continuing resolution, to effectively force the Senate to accept it.\n\nThe private meetings this week have laid bare a major dilemma for Democrats as they wrestle with how to respond to the Republican legislation. Senators said they had two unappealing alternatives. They could oppose the G.O.P. plan and potentially take the blame for a damaging federal shutdown or surrender to Mr. Trump and incite the wrath of Democrats demanding that their representatives thwart the White House at every turn.\n\n“There are really only two options,” said Senator Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats. “One is to vote for a pretty bad C.R., or the other is to vote for a potentially even worse shutdown. It is a very tough choice.”\n\nEven as Mr. Schumer declared his party’s opposition, Democrats privately continued to deliberate over a way to avoid a shutdown without appearing to capitulate to Mr. Trump. Some suggested allowing the stopgap spending bill to move forward as long as Republicans agreed to give them a chance to revise it on the Senate floor. That would afford Democrats the chance to make their political case against the measure and show that they were fighting it, even if their proposals for changes ultimately failed.\n\nBut as House Democratic leaders gathered for a retreat in Virginia on Wednesday, they pleaded with their Senate counterparts to follow their lead and oppose the government funding bill outright.\n\nRepresentative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, called the measure “a power grab that further unleashes and entrenches Elon Musk’s efforts.” He applauded his caucus for sticking together on Tuesday in voting against it and sending a clear message of repudiation for its policies on the House floor. All but one Democrat opposed the measure in the House.\n\nIn the Senate, virtually all Democrats are opposed to the stopgap bill, which cleared the House largely along party lines on Tuesday. They view it as an abdication of congressional power and a woefully inefficient way of funding the government while providing Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk more opportunity to slice into federal agencies. They also noted that it broke from an earlier bipartisan deal on both domestic and military spending.\n\n“Instead of writing a bill that gives our communities what they need, they wrote a bill that turns many of our accounts into slush funds,” said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. The bill, she added, “gives the final say over what gets funding to two billionaires who don’t know the first thing about the needs of our working families.”\n\nShe and her fellow Senate Democrats would much prefer to pass the individual spending bills that have been negotiated between the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Appropriations Committees. But House Republicans pulled back from those talks in favor of the decision to freeze most funding through Sept. 30, leaving only two remaining possibilities: blocking the spending bill or approving it.\n\nSenator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, said Democrats should not give in “just because the House decided to leave town on a Tuesday night.”\n\n“That doesn’t mean the Senate shouldn’t be a deliberative body,” he added.\n\nDespite their opposition to the spending plan, top Democrats are leery of forcing the government into a shutdown, fearing the political blowback after years of castigating Republicans for shutdowns.\n\nIn addition, Democrats worried that a shutdown would play into the hands of Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk, empowering them to keep hollowing out federal agencies. Democrats also argued that it remained unclear how any shutdown would end once it began. And they conceded that it could undercut their criticism of the Department of Government Efficiency as an out-of-control buzz saw shredding the government, if they were the ones refusing to extend funding for federal agencies.\n\nRepublicans were already trying to take advantage of their predicament.\n\n“If I listen to our colleagues across the aisle, they claim to have a lot of concern for the federal workers that depend on government funding,” said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas. “So I find interesting that so many of them in the House cast a vote that would put thousands, even hundreds of thousands, of federal workers out of work.”\n\nRelenting to Republicans was certain to inflame House Democrats and advocacy groups who were demanding that Senate Democrats remain united against the legislation.\n\nMore than 150 progressive and environmental groups on Wednesday sent Senate Democratic leaders a letter urging them to “stand strong until Musk and Trump stop their illegal actions to dismantle key federal programs.”\n\nAt least one Democrat said causing a shutdown would clear the way for additional harm.\n\n“If any of those groups want to shut the government down, I would disagree with them,” Mr. Fetterman said. “It wasn’t that long ago that we were lecturing Republicans who were threatening to shut the government down. Now I think we are in the same situation.”\n\nDemocrats have excoriated Republicans, saying they acted irresponsibly in shuttering federal agencies in past funding fights.\n\nMr. Schumer and his fellow Democrats did prompt a shutdown in 2018 as they sought to win protections for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children. But they capitulated after a brief weekend closure, when lawmakers concluded that the strategy was backfiring and angering the public.\n\nThey have sought to make certain they were not blamed in any government funding lapses since then.\n\nAnnie Karni contributed reporting from Leesburg, Va.\n\nThe suit accused employees of Southwest Key, which has worked with the federal government for more than two decades, of exploiting “children’s vulnerabilities, language barriers and distance from family and loved ones” from 2015 through at least 2023, including President Trump’s first term.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi, in the statement, blamed the Biden administration’s immigration policies for enabling the abuses.\n\n“Under the border policies of the previous administration, bad actors were incentivized to exploit children and break our laws: this ends now,” Ms. Bondi said, adding, “securing our border and protecting children from abuse are among the most critical missions of the Department of Justice and the Trump administration.”\n\nAnais Biera Miracle, a spokeswoman for Southwest Key, maintained the nonprofit denied the claims of abuse. She said it was “pleased” that the Justice Department had dropped the case in its entirety, and that charges cannot be refiled.\n\n“There is no settlement or payment required,” Ms. Miracle said in an email. “We are glad this matter is now concluded.”\n\nAbuse and harassment were also alleged to have taken place during President Trump’s first term, including during his policy of family separation, which forced thousands of additional minors into federal custody. In a complaint filed in July, federal prosecutors reported that Southwest Key employees subjected minors to threats of violence to prevent them from reporting rape, solicitations of sex and entreaties for nude photographs, among other inappropriate conduct and abuse for at least eight years, across three presidential administrations.\n\nAt the time the complaint was filed, the H.H.S., which assumes responsibility for housing children who arrive at the southern border unaccompanied by parents or legal guardians, continued to place minors at shelters run by Southwest Key even as prosecutors asked that the nonprofit face penalties and that it pay damages to the victims.\n\nThe decision appears to conclude a gradual reversal of fortune for Southwest Key, which has worked with the federal government for more than two decades, operating more than 25 shelters across Texas, Arizona and California. It has been awarded more than $6 billion in federal funds since 2007. After the H.H.S. announced that it would review its grants to Southwest Key, Ms. Miracle, the spokeswoman, said that the government had frozen funding and put in place a stop placement order on Southwest Key shelters, forcing the nonprofit to furlough about 5,000 employees.\n\nHousing underage migrants for the federal government has been a financial boon for contractors like Southwest Key, whose award money more than doubled during the family separation policy overseen by Mr. Trump in 2017 and 2018. It was one of several providers that cashed in as the administration scrambled to find shelter for more than 5,000 children forced into federal custody, turning the care of migrant children into a billion-dollar business with little transparency.\n\nThe New York Times revealed in 2018 that Southwest Key had funneled government money through a web of for-profit companies to convert public funds into private money for the organization and pay top executives millions of dollars. Shortly after, the Justice Department opened an investigation into possible financial improprieties. Southwest Key also began an internal inquiry, and high-level executives, including its founder and chief financial officer, eventually resigned.\n\nThe complaint filed by the Justice Department last year disclosed that Southwest Key had documented dozens of cases of abuse reported by children, the majority of whom were 13 to 17 and came from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. But Southwest Key’s employees did not report abuse they had observed or knew of, or any violations of policies intended to protect minors.\n\nBy one account, a worker who sexually abused three girls ages 5, 8 and 11 threatened to kill their families if they told. In another case documented by Southwest Key, a supervisor deliberately changed shifts to be alone with a teenage girl he repeatedly raped, abused and threatened. At night, he would enter her bedroom and those of others in violation of Southwest Key’s policies. The girl was transferred to a different shelter after she reported the abuse.\n\nAt the time, a spokeswoman for Southwest Key said that the complaint did not “present the accurate picture of the care and commitment our employees provide to the youth and children,” and that the company remained focused on “the safety, health and well-being” of the children at its shelters.\n\nThe subpoena requested testimony and evidence from the hotel related to “an alleged violation” of federal immigration law. It asked the hotel for the names of entities and individuals responsible for the “funding and management of the illegal immigrant/migrant shelter program,” as well as any contracts or agreements related to it.\n\nIt was unclear why prosecutors sent a subpoena to the Chandler, a hotel on East 31st Street that was converted into a homeless shelter years ago but does not operate as a shelter for migrants.\n\nThe investigation appears focused at least in part on the management and funding of hotels acting as shelters, but its full scope was unclear as of Wednesday, as was whether other hotels had received subpoenas.\n\nThe grand jury subpoena was issued by the office of the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. A spokesman for the office, Nicholas Biase, referred questions to the Department of Justice in Washington. A spokesman there declined to comment on what he said was “an ongoing criminal investigation,” adding that he could not discuss the scope or contours of the inquiry.\n\nNew York City, which is housing about 43,000 migrants in shelters across the city, including dozens of converted hotels, had not received a subpoena as of Wednesday, according to an official briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter.\n\nLiz Garcia, a spokeswoman for Mayor Eric Adams, declined to comment, saying, “We cannot comment on any type of federal investigation.”\n\nThe Guardian first reported on Wednesday that a Manhattan hotel, which they did not name, had received a subpoena.\n\nThe city’s migrant shelters have been criticized and scrutinized by the Trump administration, which has made New York City, the country’s largest sanctuary jurisdiction, a target of its immigration crackdown.\n\nThe city entered into multimillion-dollar contracts with more than 100 hotels as it struggled to house the more than 230,000 migrants who have arrived in the city seeking shelter since early 2022. Republicans have long decried the use of hotels as shelters to house migrants as wasteful spending of taxpayer funding.\n\nLast month, the Trump administration abruptly clawed back $80 million in federal funds from the city’s bank accounts that was meant to cover some expenses associated with paying hotels to shelter migrants.\n\nIn doing so, the federal government singled out the Roosevelt Hotel in Midtown, which the city had converted into its main processing center for migrants. The Trump administration depicted it as a safe haven for migrant gangs. Shortly after, the city announced it would shut down the Roosevelt Hotel by June, citing a sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in the city.\n\nWilliam K. Rashbaum contributed reporting, and Sheelagh McNeill contributed research.\n\nThe spokeswoman, McLaurine Pinover, is not the only member of the Trump administration to have used her federal office to promote outside business interests, but former agency officials and ethics watchdogs say that the timing and content of the videos were both unlawful and especially tone-deaf.\n\nGovernment watchdogs say the videos, coming from the spokeswoman of the agency driving the layoffs of thousands of federal workers, exemplify a widespread disregard for government ethics across the Trump administration.\n\n“It’s illegal for a public employee to promote a private company in their government office,” said Donald Sherman, the executive director and chief counsel for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government watchdog group.\n\n“On its own, maybe it would qualify as small potatoes, but context matters,” Mr. Sherman added. “In the context of a president and an administration that are routinely engaged in profiteering and using the office of the presidency for financial gain, in the context of someone who owns a private company, Elon Musk, coming into the administration and dismantling the government as he has, and in the context of O.P.M. being central to the administration’s attack on civil servants who actually want to be there to work for the American public, an O.P.M. political appointee engaging in this conduct is egregious.”\n\nThough presidents are legally exempt from certain conflict of interest laws, President Trump has not divested from many business interests, some of which involve real estate deals with foreign governments that could influence his diplomatic decisions. Mr. Musk, the tech billionaire whom Mr. Trump deputized to slash the federal government, continues to pursue federal contracts for his private businesses.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, the day news of Ms. Pinover’s Instagram account broke, Mr. Trump made a show of purchasing a red Model S from Tesla, of which Mr. Musk is chief executive, on the White House grounds, just a day after the company’s stock crashed.\n\nMs. Pinover’s short videos, each four to nine seconds, featured her in her office, lightheartedly modeling her clothes, applying makeup, working at her desk and occasionally blowing a kiss to the camera. They also included links to the clothes that would give her a commission from fans’ purchases.\n\nThe existence of Ms. Pinover’s accounts was first reported by CNN. The Instagram account has since been deleted, while the account that would supply commissions, ShopMy, has been wiped clean, save for Ms. Pinover’s name and picture and an invitation to “Shop my looks!”\n\nIn a statement, Ms. Pinover said she never made any money from the fashion videos.\n\n“While I was battling breast cancer as a new mom, I felt so unlike myself. I turned to social media shortly after as a personal outlet,” she wrote. “I never made any income and with only about 800 followers, I’m surprised the so-called ‘newspaper of record’ finds this newsworthy. My focus remains on serving the American people at O.P.M.”\n\nWhether she actually profited off the enterprise is irrelevant, Mr. Sherman said. The purpose of the account was to promote the clothing.\n\nMs. Pinover took on her role in the Trump administration in January, but her Instagram account — and the start of her fashion influencer videos — predated that job. Before she joined the Trump administration, she worked as a senior director for the Herald Group, a communications and advocacy firm, starting in August 2023. Before that, Ms. Pinover was a spokeswoman for Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nFormer O.P.M. employees said that Ms. Pinover should have been warned against pursuing supplementary income streams, particularly on government property, as part of a standard ethics briefing employees receive when joining the agency.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Ms. Pinover had been explicitly warned against such activity when she started the job. White House representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n“Use of public property to film one’s ‘fashion influencer’ videos should raise lots of ethical questions about how seriously the Trump administration is taking their oaths,” said Viet Tran, the deputy communications director of O.P.M. during the Biden administration, a political appointment. “Whether it’s Trump hawking Teslas on the South Lawn, SpaceX employees meddling in competitor contracts at F.A.A., or using your government offices for personal enrichment, it looks awful all around.”\n\n“From the campaign trail to Day 1 and beyond, President Trump has delivered on his promise to unleash energy dominance and lower the cost of living,” Mr. Zeldin said. “We at E.P.A. will do our part to power the great American comeback.”\n\nNowhere in the video did he refer to protecting the environment or public health, twin tenets that have guided the agency since its founding in 1970.\n\nThe E.P.A. has “no obligation to promote agriculture or commerce; only the critical obligation to protect and enhance the environment,” the first administrator, William D. Ruckelshaus, said as he explained its mission to the country weeks after the E.P.A. was created by President Richard M. Nixon. He said the agency would be focused on research, standards and enforcement in five areas: air pollution, water pollution, waste disposal, radiation and pesticides.\n\nMr. Zeldin said the E.P.A. would unwind more than two dozen protections against air and water pollution. It would overturn limits on soot from smokestacks that have been linked to respiratory problems in humans and premature deaths as well as restrictions on emissions of mercury, a neurotoxin. It would get rid of the “good neighbor rule” that requires states to address their own pollution when it’s carried by winds into neighboring states. And it would eliminate enforcement efforts that prioritize the protection of poor and minority communities.\n\nIn addition, when the agency creates environmental policy, it would no longer consider the costs to society from wildfires, droughts, storms and other disasters that might be made worse by pollution connected to that policy, Mr. Zeldin said.\n\nIn perhaps its most consequential act, the agency said it would work to erase the E.P.A.’s legal authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by reconsidering decades of science that show global warming is endangering humanity. In his video, Mr. Zeldin derisively referred to that legal underpinning as “the holy grail of the climate change religion.”\n\nMr. Zeldin called Wednesday’s actions “the largest deregulatory announcement in U.S. history.” He added, “today the green new scam ends, as the E.P.A. does its part to usher in a golden age of American success.”\n\nThe announcements do not carry the force of law. In almost every case, the E.P.A. would have to undergo a lengthy process of public comment and develop environmental and economic justifications for the change.\n\nPresident Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, campaigned on a promise to “drill, baby, drill” and ease regulations on fossil fuel companies. Since returning to the White House, he has degraded the government’s capacity to fight global warming by freezing funds for climate programs authorized by Congress, firing scientists working on weather and climate forecasts, and cutting federal support for the transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nThe United States is the world’s largest historic emitter of carbon dioxide, a planet-warming greenhouse gas that scientists agree is driving climate change and intensifying hurricanes, floods, wildfires and droughts, as well as species extinction. Last year was the hottest in recorded history, and the United States experienced 27 disasters that each cost at least $1 billion, compared to three in 1980, adjusted for inflation.\n\nDemocrats and environmental activists decried Mr. Zeldin’s moves and accused him of abandoning the E.P.A.’s responsibility to protect human health and the environment.\n\n“Today is the day Trump’s Big Oil megadonors paid for,” Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, said. He called the E.P.A. moves a series of attacks on clean air, clean water and affordable energy. “Administrator Zeldin clearly lied when he told us that he would respect the science and listen to the experts,” Mr. Whitehouse said, referring to Mr. Zeldin’s confirmation hearing.\n\nGina McCarthy, who served as E.P.A. administrator in the Obama administration, said it was “the most disastrous day in EPA history. Rolling these rules back is not just a disgrace, it’s a threat to all of us. The agency has fully abdicated its mission to protect Americans’ health and well being.”\n\nJackie Wong, senior vice president for climate change and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said repealing or weakening regulations on automobiles, power plants and more would lead to increases in asthma, heart attacks and other health problems. “At a time when millions of Americans are trying to rebuild after horrific wildfires and climate-fueled hurricanes, it’s nonsensical to try to deny that climate change harms our health and welfare,” said Ms. Wong, whose organization successfully sued the first Trump administration repeatedly over environmental rollbacks.\n\nThe Trump administration had been signaling for months that it would reverse many of the climate regulations enacted during the Biden administration. But the cascade of announcements, timed with an op-ed by Mr. Zeldin in The Wall Street Journal and the online video, was designed to attract attention before he is expected to address oil, gas and other energy providers at an annual gathering in Houston.\n\nBy midafternoon, the agency had counted 31 pronouncements that were designed, Mr. Zeldin said, to “unleash American energy.”\n\nThe top lobbying groups for the automobile, oil, gas and chemical industries, among others, applauded Mr. Zeldin’s plans.\n\nAnne Bradbury, the chief executive of the American Exploration & Production Council, a lobbying group representing oil and gas companies, called the announcements “common sense.” John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the auto lobby, said the changes would keep the industry “globally competitive.”\n\nMarty Durbin, a senior vice president at the United States Chamber of Commerce, said, “American businesses were crippled with an unprecedented regulatory onslaught during the previous Administration that contributed to higher costs felt by families around the country.” He said “The Chamber supports a more balanced regulatory approach that will protect the environment and support greater economic growth.”\n\nGroups that deny the established science of climate change also cheered Mr. Zeldin’s actions.\n\n“The Biden E.P.A. ignored the will of Congress, infringed on individual freedom, trampled on property rights and tried to force the country to use unreliable sources of electricity, such as wind and solar,” said a statement from Daren Bakst, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a think tank allied with the fossil fuel industry that believes global warming has been minimal and is good for humanity and the biosphere.\n\nSome of the most significant policy changes Mr. Zeldin said he planned include:\n\nRolling back restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. Currently the E.P.A. requires existing coal-burning power plants and new gas plants built in the United States to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions by 90 percent by 2039.\n\nRewriting tailpipe pollution standards that were designed to ensure that the majority of new passenger cars and light trucks sold in the United States are all-electric or hybrids by 2032.\n\nEasing limits on mercury emissions from power plants, as well as restrictions on soot and haze from burning coal. A Biden-era rule had aimed to slash by 70 percent emissions from coal-burning power plants of mercury, which has been linked to developmental damage in children.\n\nGreatly reducing the “social cost” of carbon, an economic estimate of the damage caused by each additional ton of carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere. That figure plays a significant role in weighing the costs and benefits of regulating industries.\n\nPerhaps the most significant move, though, is an effort to revise a 2009 legal opinion known as the E.P.A. “endangerment finding” which concluded that rising greenhouse gas emissions are a danger to public health. The finding gives the agency the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Eliminating it would make it virtually impossible for the E.P.A. to curb climate pollution from automobiles, factories, power plants or oil and gas wells.\n\nReversing the rule has long been the white whale for climate deniers. But doing so would require Mr. Trump’s E.P.A. to make and substantiate the argument that greenhouse gas emissions pose no foreseeable threats to public health, when decades of science says otherwise.\n\nJonathan H. Adler, a conservative legal expert and professor of environmental law at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, said he did not believe the Trump administration would succeed. “You’ve got to explain away decades of statements by every administration that there are negative consequences of climate change that can be reasonably anticipated,” Mr. Adler said.\n\nHe called the effort to unravel the endangerment finding “a good way to waste years of time and effort and accomplish nothing.”\n\nA correction was made on\n\nMarch 13, 2025\n\n:\n\nAn earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the views of the Climate Enterprise Institute. The group believes global warming has been minimal and good for humanity and the biosphere; it does not promote “climate denial.”\n\nWhen we learn of a mistake, we acknowledge it with a correction. If you spot an error, please let us know at nytnews@nytimes.com.Learn more\n\nMr. Ezell had been ordered to appear before a San Francisco judge as part of a lawsuit brought against the Office of Personnel Management by unions representing some of the fired workers.\n\nAs the office’s acting chief, Mr. Ezell began issuing guidance in January that agencies interpreted as orders to fire federal employees, particularly those with probationary status. That guidance is at the heart of multiple legal challenges, with the once-obscure agency assuming a lead role in President Trump’s government-gutting initiative.\n\nAccording to a legal complaint from the employee unions, Mr. Ezell held a meeting on Feb. 13 with the heads of many federal agencies in which he ordered them to fire tens of thousands of employees. The next day, O.P.M. provided a template to agencies to use for the termination letters, stating that employees were being fired for performance reasons, according to the plaintiffs.\n\nThe unions argued that O.P.M. does not have the authority to make such personnel decisions and asked the court to rule that the office’s orders were illegal and force the government to stop firing people at their direction.\n\nMr. Ezell filed a declaration on Feb. 26 asserting that he did not order the agencies to fire anyone, and that the memos from his office were intended only as “guidance.” The same day, lawyers for the unions filed examples of correspondence from O.P.M. that they argue show that the memos were indeed orders.\n\nA day later, the judge presiding over the case, William Alsup of the Northern District of California, heard arguments from both sides about O.P.M.’s role in the mass firings at the agencies involved in the lawsuit, including the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management and the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nJudge Alsup concluded that O.P.M. has no legal authority to order the agencies to fire anyone, ordered that the government retract the memos and said the government should put a stop to unlawful personnel moves. He also scheduled a hearing for Thursday, March 13, making clear he wanted Mr. Ezell to appear.\n\nO.P.M. responded to his order by retracting the original memos, but the government disputed the need for Mr. Ezell’s testimony. Judge Alsup disagreed, ordering on Monday that Mr. Ezell come before the court.\n\n“The problem here is that Acting Director Ezell submitted a sworn declaration in support of defendants’ position, but now refuses to appear to be cross-examined, or to be deposed,” Judge Alsup wrote Monday.\n\nOn Tuesday, the government confirmed that Mr. Ezell would not comply. Government lawyers said his testimony is not necessary “because existing documentary evidence and briefing demonstrates that O.P.M. is not directing agencies to terminate probationary employees.”\n\nSince the lawsuit was filed, the unions have drastically expanded its scope, including fired employees from 28 agencies, up from the five in the initial complaint.\n\nThe broader scope reflects the extraordinary personnel actions that have been taken since Mr. Trump’s return to office and the opacity surrounding who is responsible for orchestrating the wholesale changes that have been ordered by O.P.M. — Mr. Trump or his government downsizing guru, the tech billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nDuring his address to a joint session of Congress on March 4, Mr. Trump said Mr. Musk is the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, which is overseeing the culling of the federal government. Two days later, Mr. Trump told members of his cabinet that they are the ones in charge of reducing the number of employees at their agencies, not Mr. Musk.\n\nYet members of Mr. Musk’s team continue to show up at federal agencies demanding data and documents and operating with outsized importance.\n\nMr. Ezell’s testimony on Thursday would have given lawyers representing the unions the opportunity to press him on O.P.M.’s role in how Mr. Trump’s government overhaul is being carried out. According to a court filing after the government’s notice informing the judge that Mr. Ezell would not testify, the court clerk said Thursday’s hearing would go on as planned.\n\nMr. Ezell took over as leader of O.P.M. on Inauguration Day. Before that, he was a lower-level official at the agency, overseeing data analytics. He also previously served as a consultant to the agency, according to his LinkedIn page.\n\nZach Montague and Devlin Barrett contributed reporting.\n\nIt remains unclear if the department plans to farm out cases to U.S. attorney’s offices around the country, as has been discussed internally; use the shift to drastically cut the number of investigations; or both.\n\nThe move, like the forced transfers or firings of career nonpolitical prosecutors in recent weeks, is part of an effort to reduce the power of divisions that Trump appointees claim were politically “weaponized” or otherwise overused under the Biden administration.\n\nChad Gilmartin, a department spokesman, would not comment on specific plans but said the department’s leadership was “making sure our resources are being utilized in a way that assures the mission to make America safe again is successful.”\n\nThe changes being considered would affect prosecutors inside the Justice Department’s public integrity division, along with units that prosecute foreign corruption cases and conduct investigations focused on money laundering and asset recovery, the people said.\n\nThe public integrity unit, which focuses on criminal cases against elected officials, has already been particularly hard hit. Several of its prosecutors resigned last month after top officials pushed to drop a bribery case against New York’s mayor, Eric Adams.\n\nOne of the few anti-fraud units inside the department’s main office likely to be spared from the changes is a division that focuses on health care cases.\n\nThis week, senior Justice Department officials consulted with members of the public integrity team and urged them to find positions in other parts of the department, according to a person with knowledge of the exchange. The unit was once run by Jack Smith, the former special counsel who investigated Donald J. Trump.\n\nDepartment officials signaled that the corruption and fraud units inside headquarters, known as Main Justice, could be reduced from an original complement of two dozen to three dozen prosecutors to as few as 10 each, the people familiar with the changes said.\n\nJust as important, the units could be stripped of their ability to file indictments on their own, diminishing them more or less to an advisory role with no real law enforcement powers, they added.\n\nOfficials have long discussed moving fraud and corruption cases from Washington to some of the Justice Department’s 93 U.S. attorney’s offices. That is in keeping with the administration’s overarching belief that federal law enforcement embedded in the states is better suited to investigate corruption and fraud in its own jurisdiction, one of those familiar with the planning effort said.\n\nThe move comes at a time of intense turmoil inside the department, which has experienced a flurry of firings, demotions and personnel changes in the past two months. And the restructuring of the units was only the latest effort by the administration to alter the way that fraud and corruption cases are handled.\n\nLast month, Mr. Trump signed an executive order halting all investigations and prosecutions of corporate corruption in foreign countries under a law known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. He argued that pursuing such cases hurt the United States’ competitive edge.\n\nAdministration officials have also ordered the shutdown of a Justice Department initiative to seize assets owned by foreign kleptocrats.\n\nThat action came after he revoked security clearances held by any lawyers at the firm Covington & Burling who were helping provide legal advice to Jack Smith, the special counsel who brought two federal indictments against Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Trump’s actions, and open threats of more to come, have shaken law firms across Washington and beyond, leaving them looking at their client lists and wondering whether their representation could put them in the president’s cross hairs and endanger their business. Perkins Coie has acknowledged that in just the few days since Mr. Trump signed the executive order it “has already lost significant revenue” because of clients who have severed their relationship with the firm.\n\n“This is certainly the biggest affront to the legal profession in my lifetime,” said Samuel W. Buell, who is a longtime professor of law at Duke University and a former federal prosecutor.\n\nA federal judge on Wednesday sided with Perkins Coie in an initial courtroom skirmish with the White House, temporarily barring a major portion of Mr. Trump’s executive order against the firm from taking effect.\n\n“I am sure that many in the profession are watching in horror at what Perkins Coie is going through,” said Judge Beryl A. Howell of the Federal District Court in Washington. She added, “It sends little chills down my spine” to hear arguments that a president can punish individuals and companies like this.\n\nHer reaction mirrored those of other legal experts who said the issues at stake go far beyond whether or not Mr. Trump will make life difficult for elite law firms and well-paid lawyers.\n\nThe experts say Mr. Trump’s actions could create a trickle-down effect in which those who find themselves under scrutiny from Mr. Trump and his administration struggle to find lawyers who are willing to defend them in the face of the vast powers of the federal government. Those facing scrutiny could be forced to turn to less skilled lawyers or firms that enjoy access or good ties to the White House, the experts say.\n\n“If you’re a political enemy, you really need the best representation when the government comes after you for who you are,” said Daniel C. Richman, a professor of law at Columbia University and former federal prosecutor. “Chilling the lawyers who represent those people hurts the rule of law because when the government can’t be legally opposed, the law provides no protections to anyone and you start to live in an autocracy.”\n\nMr. Trump’s attack on Big Law comes as his administration has also gone after law schools, the American Bar Association and even lawyers inside the government itself who might question or hinder his agenda.\n\nLast week, the top federal prosecutor in Washington threatened to stop hiring graduates from Georgetown Law School if its dean, William Treanor, failed to abolish the school’s diversity programs. Mr. Treanor all but dared the prosecutor, Ed Martin, to make good on his threats, saying that the First Amendment would forbid them.\n\nMr. Trump has often relied on pliant lawyers to do his bidding, and last month he fired the three top lawyers in the armed forces who are supposed to advise military leaders on the legality of various policies and operations. The lawyers, known as judge advocates general, were fired without reference to their professional performance, raising concerns that the administration wanted replacements who would be more amenable to Mr. Trump’s orders.\n\nOne of the first big tests of this new era arose late last week, setting off maneuvering that shows how big firms in Washington are rushing to adapt to the new challenges they face, according to interviews with people involved in or briefed on those discussions.\n\nIn his executive order targeting Perkins Coie, Mr. Trump was going after a firm that represented Mrs. Clinton’s campaign and repeatedly won election law cases in 2020 against Mr. Trump’s campaign. Mr. Trump singled out Perkins Coie’s involvement in a dossier complied during the 2016 campaign by a former British spy about Mr. Trump’s potential ties to Russia.\n\nAmid concerns in the legal community about a chilling effect, few, if any, major firms issued statements condemning Mr. Trump’s action. And amid that silence there was a question about whether any firm would take the even bigger step of agreeing to represent Perkins Coie in its effort to challenge Mr. Trump’s executive order in court.\n\nPerkins Coie reached out to Derek L. Shaffer, a lawyer at the firm Quinn Emanuel. Mr. Shaffer had a long history of bringing civil actions against federal and state governments, and had argued before the Supreme Court three times. Perkins Coie wanted to see if he could take on the firm as a client and quickly go to court to file a suit against the Trump administration to stop the executive order.\n\nConvincing Mr. Shaffer to take the case would come with a major potential bonus: close links to Mr. Trump and his allies.\n\nLawyers at Quinn Emanuel represent Elon Musk and provide ethics advice to the Trump Organization. The firm has also represented Mayor Eric Adams of New York as the Trump Justice Department has moved swiftly to drop corruption charges against Mr. Adams, a Democrat.\n\nBut Perkins Coie was rebuffed. Quinn Emanuel decided against taking the case. Its top leaders concluded that this was not an issue they wanted to jump into at this stage as they continue to build themselves into a power center in Mr. Trump’s Washington.\n\nOther major law firms expressed concerns that if they represented Perkins Coie, they, too, could face Mr. Trump’s ire. Leaders of top firms asked: How would their own clients react if Mr. Trump cut off their access to the government?\n\nIn response, the elite Washington firm Williams and Connolly decided it would take on Perkins Coie as a client.\n\nIt’s unclear why Williams and Connolly was willing to take a risk that other firms were not. But lawyers at Williams and Connolly have long taken pride in their role as an adversary and check against the government, including by highlighting the firm’s role in protecting high-profile defendants against prosecutorial misconduct. The firm was founded by the well-known defense lawyer Edward Bennett Williams, who built his career on vigorously representing an array of clients before the government, including those out of political favor.\n\nOn Tuesday, Williams and Connolly, on behalf of Perkins Coie, filed suit against the Trump administration in Washington. That suit led to Judge Howell’s ruling on Wednesday imposing a temporary restraining order to block for now the section of Mr. Trump’s executive order that essentially barred Perkins Coie from dealing with federal officials and prevented it from entering government buildings. She said the executive order was most likely unconstitutional.\n\nOther law firms have been discussing whether to file a joint amicus brief on behalf of Perkins Coie. While some major firms have signaled they are willing to sign onto it, others have said they are reluctant. On Wednesday, 21 state attorneys general filed their own amicus brief supporting Perkins Coie.\n\nCovington & Burling, which had the security clearance stripped from a lawyer at the firm who was assisting Mr. Smith, has taken a different approach from that of Perkins Coie.\n\nCovington has declined to fight Mr. Trump in court. Instead, the firm, concerned about a perception among its clients that it was falling out of favor with Mr. Trump, has begun discussions with other prominent law firms with fewer ties to Mr. Trump’s perceived enemies about becoming the face of some of their most important cases before the Justice Department.\n\nBut beyond what Mr. Trump has done to law firms, the political appointees he has placed at departments, agencies and commissions are taking on the legal profession in other ways.\n\nOne of Mr. Trump’s political appointees has ordered government officials under him to not renew their memberships to the American Bar Association, hold a position with the association or attend its events.\n\nAt the Justice Department, the attorney general has sent a letter to the American Bar Association questioning its diversity practices.\n\nAnd last week, at an annual conference on white-collar crime for the association, a slew of top officials from the Justice Department — who regularly attend the event — canceled at the last minute. That meant that a conference designed to bring together the industry about an important topic was devoid of senior department officials in charge of enforcing the law.\n\nAbbie VanSickle and Alan Feuer contributed reporting.\n\nA correction was made on\n\nMarch 12, 2025\n\n:\n\nAn earlier version of this story referred imprecisely to an element of the executive order President Trump issued about the law firm Covington & Burling. The order stripped security clearances from any lawyers at the firm who assisted the former special counsel Jack Smith. It did not strip security clearances from the firm.\n\nWhen we learn of a mistake, we acknowledge it with a correction. If you spot an error, please let us know at nytnews@nytimes.com.Learn more\n\nBut news of the proposed appointment generated blowback on the right. A senior administration official said Ms. Gabbard reconsidered her choice given the criticism, and other officials confirmed the decision.\n\nMr. Davis is a senior fellow at Defense Priorities, a think tank with funding from Charles Koch that has a number of alumni in key positions in the Trump administration. Defense Priorities has taken a skeptical view of U.S. military involvement in the Middle East and has supported Mr. Trump’s efforts to reach an immediate cease-fire in the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe abandoned appointment has highlighted an emerging foreign policy fault line in the new administration. The Trump administration has appointed both more hawkish Republicans, like Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Michael Waltz, the national security adviser, and officials far more skeptical of American intervention, including Ms. Gabbard.\n\nThe tug of war over Mr. Davis’s appointment also highlighted the strain among supporters of Mr. Trump’s over U.S. support of Israel.\n\nBefore Mr. Davis’s appointment was pulled, the Anti-Defamation League said on Wednesday that the appointment would be “extremely dangerous.” In a social media post, the group accused Mr. Davis of minimizing Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack and undermining American support for Israel.\n\nConsideration of Mr. Davis had also upset some hawkish conservatives in Congress who began quietly trying to get the administration to rethink it. These officials believed Mr. Davis’s skepticism of the war in Gaza could weaken the Trump administration’s support for Israel.\n\nFormer intelligence officials were also critical of the pick. Marc Polymeropoulos, a former C.I.A. operations officer and a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said Mr. Davis’s positions were outside the ideological mainstream of the Republican Party.\n\n“His overt criticism of Israel and total opposition to any military action against Iran seems to run counter to current administration policy,” Mr. Polymeropoulos said.\n\nAllies of Mr. Davis had defended him and said there was no hint of antisemitism or opposition to Israel in his work. He is skeptical of military action when it does not directly align with American interests, they say, and troubled by the use of proxies when the United States is unwilling to put its own troops in harm’s way.\n\nWhile some of Mr. Davis’s criticisms of Israel are well outside the mainstream of the Republican Party, they are similar to certain critiques by liberal Democrats. He has spoken frequently about the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump has repeatedly called for Palestinians to be removed from Gaza to allow it to be redeveloped into a beach resort, Mr. Davis has said the removal of people from the territory would be “ethnic cleansing.”\n\nIn January, he wrote on social media that U.S. support for Israel’s war in Gaza was a “stain on our character as a nation, as a culture, that will not soon go away.”\n\nConsideration of Mr. Davis for the intelligence post was reported earlier by Jewish Insider.\n\nMs. Gabbard has said little about the war in Gaza recently. But many of Mr. Davis’s other positions, including a skepticism of American support for Ukraine’s war effort and his worries about the consequences of the fall of the Syrian government, match her views. And Mr. Davis’s social media feed has been supportive of Ms. Gabbard’s foreign policy positions.\n\nDuring the Biden administration, the head of mission integration conducted many intelligence briefings at the White House. Beth Sanner, who was deputy director of mission integration through much of the first Trump administration, was the primary presidential briefer. Another intelligence official has had that responsibility in the current Trump administration, according to former officials.\n\nIn recent years, senior C.I.A. analysts with decades of experience have had the briefing responsibility. Robert Cardillo, who was the first person ever to hold the job, had been a senior official at the Defense Intelligence Agency.\n\nThe grants were issued to a total of eight nonprofit organizations through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which received $27 billion in funding from Congress through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nBut since taking office, Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A.’s administrator, has tried to claw back the money, saying they were part of a “scheme” and citing as evidence a hidden-camera video from Project Veritas, a conservative group known for using covert recordings to embarrass its political opponents.\n\nThe E.P.A. can cancel the grant contracts if it can document examples of waste, fraud, and abuse by the grantees. But that hasn’t happened at this point.\n\nYesterday, Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee launched an investigation into the E.P.A,’s freezing of the funds and what they said were Mr. Zeldin’s “false and misleading statements.”\n\nTwo of the nonprofit grant recipients, Climate United and the Coalition for Green Capital, said they will fight the cancellation. A court hearing on a related case is scheduled for Wednesday.\n\nHere is what we know about the $20 billion in funding and how it became a target of the E.P.A.\n\nHow the controversy started\n\nIn February, Mr. Zeldin announced that he had found billions of dollars of “gold bars” of grant funding at Citibank, calling the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (or “green bank”) grant program a “scheme” and a “rush job with no oversight.”\n\nMr. Zeldin has embraced the Trump administration’s emphasis on spending cuts, touting his work with the Department of Government Efficiency. He has canceled scores of other E.P.A. contracts, totaling what the agency said is around $2 billion across more than 400 initiatives.\n\nThe “gold bars” comment was a reference to a video released in December by Project Veritas in which Brent Efron, then an E.P.A. employee, likened his agency’s efforts to spend federal funds on climate programs before leaving office to throwing “gold bars” off the Titanic.\n\nMr. Efron’s lawyer has denied his client was referring to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.\n\nAfter Mr. Zeldin’s statement, Ed Martin, the interim U.S. attorney for Washington D.C., asked Denise Cheung, a top federal prosecutor, to freeze the $20 billion held by Citibank. But she abruptly resigned after determining there was not enough evidence to order the funds frozen. The F.B.I. and the Justice Department continued their investigations.\n\nLast week, Mr. Zeldin also referred the matter to his agency’s acting inspector general for a third, concurrent investigation.\n\nThe nonprofit grant recipients began executing their legal defense this past weekend, when Climate United sued E.P.A. and Citibank, claiming they were illegally withholding the money. Two other recipients filed suits against Citibank in the following days.\n\nA hearing on Climate United’s request for a temporary restraining order to release the funds was scheduled for Wednesday in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.\n\nWhat the nonprofits are saying\n\nThe cancellations surprised Climate United, a nonprofit organization that was awarded nearly $7 billion, said Beth Bafford, the group’s chief executive officer. She said she received an official termination letter a half-hour before the agency issued a public statement.\n\nThe nonprofits have been unable to access the funds in their Citibank accounts since mid-February. The funds have been held there under an agreement between the E.P.A. and the bank.\n\nWithout the promised funds, some groups said they are struggling to pay staff.\n\nIn a termination letter viewed by The New York Times, the E.P.A. said it had identified “material deficiencies” in the program, including the absence of adequate oversight and improper or speculative allocation of funds. It did not provide any evidence.\n\nThe Coalition for Green Capital, one of the largest recipients, called the E.P.A.’s decision “unauthorized and unlawful,” and said it was considering legal options.\n\nWhat we know about the $20 billion program\n\nThe $20 billion program was designed to offer low-cost loans to businesses and developers for climate initiatives, which include things like installing solar panels and retrofitting homes to make them more energy efficient.\n\nThe E.P.A. distributed the money to eight nonprofits, which planned to distribute the money as loans as well as grants to local “green banks’” or credit unions, which would in turn make their own loans.\n\nThe idea was that the commitment of federal dollars would attract private investments to green projects.\n\nMr. Zeldin has made much of the fact that $20 billion in grant money was held at Citibank, portraying the E.P.A.’s decision to use an outside financial institution as an intermediary as an attempt to subvert oversight.\n\nGrant recipients and former E.P.A. officials have disputed this characterization, and said that the agency has full visibility into transactions through the Citibank accounts for the nonprofit organizations and their sub-recipients\n\nIt’s not clear how much of the $20 billion was spent before the freeze was put in place.\n\nA spokeswoman for the E.P.A. said it could not answer how much of the money has been loaned out by the nonprofits because the funds were spent under the Biden administration.\n\nCitibank did not respond to request for comment.",

        "full_text": "The Department of Education plans to cut about half its staff, officials announced Tuesday evening.\n\nSenior officials within the department told reporters on Tuesday that the reduction will not have any impact on the government's ability to deliver programming to students but is instead about \"consolidation\" of redundant roles.\n\nThe department will make the following reductions from its more than 4,000 staff:\n\n259 staffers who signed up for deferred resignation\n\n313 staffers who accepted $25,000 voluntary separation incentive payments\n\n1,315 staffers who are now subject to the reduction in force\n\n63 probationary employees who had their roles eliminated in February\n\nThose staffers who are now subject to the reduction in force will receive full pay and benefits for the next 90 days and a severance of one week's salary for service up to 10 years and 2 weeks' salary for every additional year of service.\n\nNotifications to affected workers were sent via email around 6 p.m. ET on Tuesday, department officials said. The main Department of Education office building was to be closed for safety on Wednesday.\n\nThe reductions would also lead to a consolidation in department office space, officials said. Offices in San Francisco, California; New York; Boston, Massachusetts; Chicago, Illinois; Cleveland, Ohio; and Dallas, Texas would be closed. The department would also consolidate its footprint in Washington, D.C., from three buildings to one.\n\nThe cuts would not impact federal student aid, FAFSA operations, civil rights investigations or any other mandatory department functions, officials said.\n\nRELATED STORY | Senate confirms billionaire Linda McMahon as Secretary of Education\n\nThe reduction comes shortly after the Senate confirmed billionaire Linda McMahon, President Trump's pick for Education Secretary.\n\nAt her confirmation hearing, McMahon said she intended to make the Education Department \"operate more efficiently.\"\n\nBut President Trump has promised to eliminate the Department of Education. He has already signed sweeping orders to target diversity programs and transgender accommodations in schools and expand school choice.\n\nCritics warn staffing cuts at the department will erode its effectiveness in the meantime.\n\n“The real victims will be our most vulnerable students. Gutting the Department of Education will send class sizes soaring, cut job training programs, make higher education more expensive and out of reach for middle-class families, take away special education services for students with disabilities, and gut student civil rights protections,\" said National Education Association President Becky Pringle. “Firing — without cause — nearly half of the Department of Education staff means they are getting rid of the dedicated public servants who help ensure our nation’s students have access to the programs and resources to keep class sizes down and expand learning opportunities for students so they can grow into their full brilliance. The Trump administration has abandoned students, parents, and educators across the nation.\"",

        "full_text": "I walked into the Washington Post building for the first time in the summer of 1981. Past the red linotype machine that marked the entrance to the Post’s Fifteenth Street headquarters for so many years and up to the fifth-floor newsroom, a cavernous space that looked just as it’s depicted in “All the President’s Men.”\n\nI was fresh out of college and on my way to law school. Along the way, I’d worked at a small legal newspaper, where I found myself both interested in the subject and annoyed at being condescended to by lawyers about my lack of a degree. Bob Woodward, the Post’s Metro editor, had read some of my pieces and invited me in to talk. In fact, he tried to talk me out of law school. He told me that he had turned down Harvard to work for the Sentinel, a paper in Montgomery County, Maryland. Why not just come to the Post?\n\nI gulped, and asked Woodward how old he had been then. Twenty-seven, he said. Great, I said, I’ll be twenty-six when I graduate from law school. I’ll be back. And I was, first as a summer intern, in 1982, and then as a full-time reporter, starting September 4, 1984, covering Prince George’s County, in suburban Maryland. I stayed for forty years, six months, and six days.\n\nI stayed until I no longer could—until the newspaper’s owner, Jeff Bezos, issued an edict that the Post’s opinion offerings would henceforth concentrate on the twin pillars of “personal liberties and free markets,” and, even more worrisome, that “viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.” I stayed until the Post’s publisher, Will Lewis, killed a column I filed last week expressing my disagreement with this new direction. Lewis refused my request to meet. (You can read the column in full below, but—spoiler alert—if you’re craving red meat, brace for tofu. I wrote the piece in the hope of getting it published and registering a point, not to embarrass or provoke the paper’s management.)\n\nIs it possible to love an institution the way you love a person, fiercely and without reservation? For me, and for many other longtime staff reporters and editors, that is the way we have felt about the Post. It was there for us, and we for it. One Saturday night, in May, 1992, the investigative reporter George Lardner, Jr., was in the newsroom when he received a call that his twenty-one-year-old daughter, Kristin, had been shot and killed in Boston by an abusive ex-boyfriend. As I recall, there were no more flights that night to Boston. The Post’s C.E.O., Don Graham, chartered a plane to get Lardner where he needed to go. It was typical of Graham, a kindness that engendered the loyalty and affection of a dedicated staff.\n\nGraham’s own supreme act of loyalty to the Post was his painful decision to sell the paper, in 2013, to Bezos, who made his vast fortune as the founder of Amazon. The Graham family was hardly poor, but in the new media environment—and under the relentless demands of reporting quarterly earnings—they were forced, again and again, to make trims, at a time when investment was needed. Instead of continuing to cut and, inevitably, diminish the paper that he loved, Graham carried out a meticulous search for a new owner with the resources, the judgment, and the vision to help the Post navigate this new era. Bezos—the “ultimate disrupter,” as Fortune had called him a year earlier—seemed the right choice.\n\nAs a deputy to the late editorial-page editor Fred Hiatt, I had the chance to see the drama of a new ownership play out up close. In the summer and fall of 2016, as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump battled for the Presidency, our editorial board, of which I was a member, was unsparing in its criticism of Trump. As the G.O.P. Convention concluded, in late July, Hiatt published an extra-long editorial that made it clear, even before Democrats held their Convention, that the paper could not support Trump.\n\n“The real estate tycoon is uniquely unqualified to serve as president, in experience and temperament,” Hiatt wrote. “He is mounting a campaign of snarl and sneer, not substance. To the extent he has views, they are wrong in their diagnosis of America’s problems and dangerous in their proposed solutions. Mr. Trump’s politics of denigration and division could strain the bonds that have held a diverse nation together. His contempt for constitutional norms might reveal the nation’s two-century-old experiment in checks and balances to be more fragile than we knew.” That wasn’t the end of what we had to say. In September, 2016, we published a series of six editorials outlining “the clear and present danger of Donald Trump,” from climate change to the global economy to immigration.\n\nWe had every indication that Bezos shared this sense of alarm. Bezos and Hiatt held twice-monthly telephone calls, which I joined, along with the Post’s then publisher, Fred Ryan, and Hiatt’s other deputy, Jackson Diehl. These were not conversations in which the owner handed down instructions; they were more like dorm-room gab sessions, with a heavy dose of policy. We proffered morsels of Washington gossip and delivered our insights, such as they were, about politics and international affairs. Bezos talked about the need to find innovative ways to connect with readers—he mentioned something about an exploding watermelon that had gone viral on BuzzFeed, though I didn’t exactly follow how that applied to our work. When our humor columnist Alexandra Petri spoofed Samuel Beckett in “Waiting for Pivot: A GOP Tragicomedy,” featuring Vladimir Ryan and Estragon Priebus waiting for Trump’s shift to the center, Bezos suggested that we post a video dramatization. (Proving that immense wealth and sole ownership don’t always get you what you want, our video department balked.)\n\nIn my experience of that time, Bezos came off as charming, smart, and unpretentious. “Guys, this is always the most interesting meeting of my week,” he would often say, seeming to mean it. Or, “I know we’ve been going on for a while, but can I hold you for one more question?”—as if he weren’t the owner, and we weren’t at his beck and call.\n\nTrump’s first election and Inauguration brought some inklings of trouble. Some sixty-three million voters had backed Trump, but even our conservative columnists—including George Will, Charles Krauthammer, and Michael Gerson—were highly critical of Trump. Bezos pressed us to find more writers from the heartland, who might understand Trump’s appeal. This was entirely appropriate. More unsettling was his expressed desire, at the start of the new Administration, to have the editorial page find something, anything, positive to say about Trump. During Trump’s first term, the Post’s executive editor was Martin Baron. As Baron relates in his book, “Collision of Power,” Bezos “urged showing support for Trump on whatever issues he could. . . . Whenever the Post editorial board’s view coincided with Trump’s, why not say so?” Hiatt, Baron wrote, “feared that Bezos was anxious to smooth things over with the new occupant of the White House.” During one pre-Inauguration phone call, Bezos seized on a line from Trump’s first post-election news conference—“I have great respect for the news and great respect for freedom of the press and all of that”—as a promising sign. This was an exceedingly charitable interpretation, given that, at the same event, Trump had refused to take a question from “fake news” CNN, called the BBC “another beauty,” and denounced BuzzFeed as a “failing pile of garbage,” and we suggested as much to Bezos.\n\nStill, we tried to give Trump, where possible, the benefit of the doubt. One example was an editorial published on January 18, 2017, outlining “five policies Trump might get right.” It noted that, despite the newspaper’s endorsement of his opponent, Trump’s “election was legitimate, and his inauguration is inevitable. All of us have a duty to oppose Mr. Trump when he is wrong, but also to remain open to supporting him when he and the Republican-majority Congress make worthy proposals.” In the end, we didn’t find much to cheer about in Trump’s first term—and Bezos never pressured us to go easy on him.\n\nFour years later, the editorial board endorsed Joe Biden for President, warning that “democracy is at risk, at home and around the world. The nation desperately needs a president who will respect its public servants; stand up for the rule of law; acknowledge Congress’s constitutional role; and work for the public good, not his private benefit.” There was no disagreement from the owner.\n\nSo much changed—and long before Bezos’s eleventh-hour decision to kill the newspaper’s endorsement of Kamala Harris in 2024. Hiatt died suddenly in December, 2021. He was replaced by David Shipley (full disclosure: I applied for the job and didn’t get it), who, as an executive editor of Bloomberg’s opinion coverage, had experience dealing with, and channelling the views of, a billionaire owner. To read the paper’s 2024 editorials on Trump and Biden, and then on Trump and Harris, is to experience a once passionate voice grown hesitant and muted. (I left the editorial board in September, 2023.) Granted, Democrats offered voters two far from perfect candidates, but, to paraphrase Biden, we’re not comparing them to the Almighty here.\n\nCertainly, Trump was not spared from criticism; in fact, there was no doubt which candidate the editorial board preferred. Yet the shift in tone was unmistakable. You would not know from the 2024 editorials that just four years earlier we had called Trump “the worst president of modern times”—and that was before the January 6th insurrection at the Capitol. A September, 2024, editorial that purported to compare Trump and Harris on policy grounds concluded that “the substantive contrasts Ms. Harris draws with Mr. Trump generally make her look better. But should Americans settle?” Generally? Look at what Trump’s been doing since taking office—at his barrage of unconstitutional, small-minded, and cruel executive orders—and tell me that Harris was “generally” better.\n\nIt was becoming clear, as September gave way to October, that something was up with the endorsement. Those not in the know—which included almost all of us in the Opinions section, because the piece was unusually closely held—figured that the delay involved negotiating over tone and adjectives. Then, on October 25th, came the first of our self-inflicted wounds: the paper’s leadership announced that, in fact, we would not be issuing an endorsement in the 2024 Presidential race, and wouldn’t in future contests.\n\nLewis, the publisher and chief executive officer, cast this decision as “returning to our roots,” referring to our long-ago practice of not endorsing in Presidential contests. This was, to say the least, unconvincing. The modern Post—the post-Watergate Post—issued Presidential endorsements in every election but the dreary Michael Dukakis–George H. W. Bush matchup, of 1988, when the paper rigorously explained its reasoning for finding neither of the candidates worthy.\n\nThe more senior columnists—David Ignatius, Eugene Robinson, Karen Tumulty, Dana Milbank, and I—conferred about what to do. We drafted a statement, eventually signed by twenty-one columnists, calling the decision “a terrible mistake” and an “abandonment of the fundamental editorial convictions of the newspaper that we love.” I called my editor to say that I’d also be filing a column disagreeing with this decision. What I heard back was encouraging: the section editors welcome it, they’ll run it, they’ll hold space for you in print. And the column ran, with no resistance from editors.\n\n“I have never been more disappointed in the newspaper than I am today,” I wrote. The owner has the right to shape editorial policy, I acknowledged, and there are reasons to eschew endorsements: they can cause headaches for the separate, news side of the paper. Moreover, Presidential endorsements are something of a vanity operation—unlike with more local contests, readers don’t need them to guide their votes. Choosing to abandon the practice would be a reasonable decision.\n\nStill, I argued, “this is not the time to make such a shift. It is the time to speak out, as loudly and convincingly as possible, to make the case that we made in 2016 and again in 2020.” Since then, Trump had incited an insurrection that threatened the life of his own Vice-President, had refused to accept the reality of his 2020 loss and claimed he wouldn’t accept defeat in the 2024 contest, and had threatened to “go after” political enemies and “terminate” the Constitution. “What self-respecting news organization could abandon its entrenched practice of making presidential endorsements in the face of all this?” I asked.\n\nThe “kicker” wrote itself, and it is painful to read now: “Many friends and readers have reached out today, saying they planned to cancel their subscriptions or had already done so. I understand, and share, your anger. I think the best answer, for you and for me, may be embodied in this column: You are reading it, on the same platform, in the same newspaper, that has so gravely disappointed you.”\n\nAs many as three hundred thousand readers reportedly cancelled their subscriptions. Two of our non-staff columnists—Robert Kagan and Michele Norris—resigned. Should I have joined them? The paper had demonstrated that my columnist colleagues and I were free to write what we wanted. If Trump were elected, I reasoned, my voice and my expertise—we columnists are a grandiose lot—would count for something. In retrospect, you can say that this frog chose to remain in the simmering pot, but she thought hard about it.\n\nThings got worse, in two connected ways—three if you count Trump’s election. After November 5th, Bezos joined his fellow tech billionaires in seeming to court Trump’s favor. “I’m actually very optimistic this time around,” Bezos said on December 4th, at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit. “He seems to have a lot of energy around reducing regulation. And my point of view, if I can help him do that, I’m going to help him.”\n\nWhen his interviewer, Andrew Ross Sorkin, pressed Bezos about Trump’s depiction of the press as “the enemy,” Bezos said, “I’m gonna try to talk him out of that idea. I don’t think the press is the enemy and I don’t think, he’s also—you’ve probably grown in the last eight years. He has, too.” Trump, he continued, “is calmer than he was the first time and more confident, more settled.” This wasn’t the triumph of hope over experience; it was the elevation of willful self-delusion over all available evidence.\n\nOn December 12th, Amazon said that it would follow Meta’s lead and donate a million dollars to Trump’s Inauguration. On December 18th, Bezos and his fiancée, Lauren Sánchez, dined with Trump and Melania at Mar-a-Lago, joined by Elon Musk. “In this term, everybody wants to be my friend,” Trump observed. He had reason to think as much. On January 5th, Amazon announced that it had bought the rights to a documentary about Melania, co-produced by Melania herself. Puck’s Matthew Belloni reported that the streaming service was paying forty million dollars to license the film—reportedly the most Amazon had ever spent on a documentary, and almost three times the highest competing bid. The Wall Street Journal reported that Melania stood to pocket more than seventy per cent of that fee—and that, at the Mar-a-Lago dinner, Melania “regaled” Bezos and Sánchez with details about the project.\n\nAmid all this, Ann Telnaes, the Post’s Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist, submitted a cartoon depicting Bezos and his fellow-billionaires on their knees before a statue of Trump. On January 3rd, Telnaes announced that she was quitting because the cartoon had been rejected. “There have been instances where sketches have been rejected or revisions requested, but never because of the point of view inherent in the cartoon’s commentary,” Telnaes wrote. “That’s a game changer . . . and dangerous for a free press.” As far as I can tell, the rejection didn’t happen at Bezos’s direction. Shipley, the editorial-page editor, made the call, on the unconvincing ground that the cartoon was duplicative—Eugene Robinson had written a column on the billionaires’ pilgrimages to Mar-a-Lago, and another one was in the works.\n\n“Not every editorial judgment is a reflection of a malign force,” Shipley wrote in a statement. The “only bias” in the decision, he added, “was against repetition.” It is true that the section under Shipley’s guidance had tried to crack down on multiple columns making the same point. But the notion that a cartoon could not make a similar point was ludicrous. (In any event, there had been developments since Robinson’s column: the centerpiece of the Telnaes cartoon was a prostrate Mickey Mouse, reflecting Disney’s malodorous decision to settle Trump’s defamation lawsuit against ABC News by paying fifteen million dollars for his Presidential foundation and museum and a million dollars to cover his legal fees.) There is no doubt in my mind that, absent Bezos, the cartoon would have run unchallenged. The decision to kill it was an instance of obeying in advance.\n\nThis episode was far more concerning than the non-endorsement decision, because it wasn’t limited to the paper’s institutional editorial position—it implied that restrictions were coming for columnists, too. In hindsight—and, again, I thought about it at the time—maybe that should have been the moment I left.\n\nThen came the Inauguration, with the spectacle of Bezos and his fellow-tycoons arrayed like so many trophies behind the triumphant new President. I tested the limits with a column about the “inauguration of the oligarchs.” The column decried the spectacle and named Bezos but, I have to confess, shied away from pointing out that a newspaper was among Bezos’s playthings. His presence on the inaugural platform conveyed a message of support for Trump that, I can say now, was inappropriate.\n\nAs it turned out, the vast majority of us at the paper had no idea what was happening behind the scenes as Shipley, Lewis, and Bezos debated a new vision for the Opinions section. That vision arrived in our inboxes at 9:31 A.M. on February 26th, with Bezos’s announcement of “a change coming to our opinion pages” and the news that Shipley was resigning.\n\n“I offered David Shipley, whom I greatly admire, the opportunity to lead this new chapter. I suggested to him that if the answer wasn’t ‘hell yes,’ then it had to be ‘no,’ ” Bezos wrote. “After careful consideration, David decided to step away.”\n\nThe columnists were deeply wounded by the newly announced limits and what they portended. We had always been able to assure our readers that no one restricted what we could write. How could we credibly make that claim now? What was the meaning of “personal liberties and free markets?” Without further clarification, we were like dogs that had been fitted with shock collars but had no clue where the invisible fence was situated. Dana Milbank was the first to test the new regime, with a clever column that put every Trump action through a Bezosian lens. “If we as a newspaper, and we as a country, are to defend Bezos’s twin pillars, then we must redouble our fight against the single greatest threat to ‘personal liberties and free markets’ in the United States today: President Donald Trump,” he wrote.\n\nMilbank’s column somehow passed muster and ran—even though that required the highly unusual step of it being submitted to the publisher for review. Eugene Robinson followed, with a subtle column on the new documentary about Katharine Graham; the column made no reference to Bezos, but its paeans to Graham’s courage in the face of Richard Nixon’s threats evoked an implicit comparison with the current owner and his relationship with Trump. Our media critic, Erik Wemple, was less fortunate. His straightforward column disagreeing with the Bezos announcement—I read it in our internal system, and found it perfectly reasonable—never ran.\n\nAnd so I took the plunge. On a long flight to Washington, I opened my laptop. I knew what would likely happen before I typed a single word. I had spoken out forcefully against the decision to kill the endorsement. Censoring columnists was way worse. Having written then, how could I stay silent and live with myself now? Still, I hesitated. Since Trump’s Inauguration, I had been writing at a furious pace, assailing his blizzard of executive orders, his assaults on the rule of law, his dismantling of the Justice Department, which I had covered as a young reporter. Was speaking out on Bezos important enough to risk losing the platform that the Post provided?\n\nI tried, as you will see if you read the column, to give the editors a way to get to yes. I made almost no mention of Bezos’s post-election efforts to cozy up to Trump. I did not question Bezos’s motives. The column was, if anything, meek to the point of embarrassing. But I thought that it was important to put my reasons for disagreement on the record—not only to be true to myself but to show that the newspaper could brook criticism and that columnists still enjoyed freedom of expression. Running it, I believed, would enhance the Post’s credibility, not undermine it.\n\nJust before 1 P.M. on Monday, March 3rd, my editor sent the column to higher-ups for review. Under ordinary circumstances, it would have gone to the copy desk in a matter of hours. This time, silence ensued. Early Wednesday evening, some fifty hours after the column was first submitted, I received a call from Mary Duenwald, who had followed Shipley from Bloomberg to serve as a deputy. The verdict from Will Lewis, she said, was no. Pause here for a moment: I know of no other episode at the Washington Post, and I have checked with longtime employees at the paper, when a publisher has ordered a column killed.\n\nAccording to Duenwald’s explanation, the column did not pass the “high bar” required for the Post to write about itself. It was “too speculative,” because we couldn’t know, until a new opinion editor was named, what the impact of the new direction would be. It could turn out that none of our columns would be affected by the Bezos plan. Duenwald said that my column on the endorsement had been accepted because it involved a clear-cut decision; the opinion-page policy was a work in progress.\n\nNone of this was any more convincing than the rationale for rejecting the Telnaes cartoon. At bottom, the “too speculative” excuse took our owner for a feckless fool, which he is most certainly not. He announced a change in direction, and we should take him at his word, not assume that it was meaningless, or that he would forget about the idea. And my point was not only about what columns would get through the filter, once installed; it was about maintaining the trust of our readers. I asked to speak with Lewis. He declined to see me, instructing an editor to inform me that there was no reason to meet, because his decision was final.\n\nSo, too, was mine. I submitted my letter of resignation on Monday, to Bezos and Lewis. “Will’s decision to not run the column that I wrote respectfully dissenting from Jeff’s edict—something that I have not experienced in almost two decades of column-writing—underscores that the traditional freedom of columnists to select the topics they wish to address and say what they think has been dangerously eroded,” I wrote. “I love the Post. It breaks my heart to conclude that I must leave.”\n\nThis was not the outcome I sought. I will always be rooting for the Post and its journalists. I hope, for the sake of my colleagues but even more for the good of readers, that Bezos’s plan for the Opinions section will turn out in practice to be more capacious and less stifling than feared. Even more, I hope that Bezos will hold to his commitment, and to his stalwart practice, during Trump’s first term, of not knuckling under to the President’s pressure campaign to interfere with news coverage. We have lost so much talent in the newsroom in the past few months as reporters and editors have defected to competitors—and we’re still publishing remarkable work. (I’ll never stop saying “we.”)\n\nI wish we could return to the newspaper of a not so distant past. But that is not to be, and here is the unavoidable truth: the Washington Post I joined, the one I came to love, is not the Washington Post I left.\n\nHere is the column that the Post would not run:\n\n“The values of the Post do not need changing,” Jeff Bezos told employees when he bought the newspaper a dozen years ago. He echoed the words of the Post’s owner Eugene Meyer in 1935, emphasizing, “The paper’s duty will remain to its readers and not to the private interests of its owners.”\n\nAgreed, and, at the risk of sounding naïve, I believe Bezos still agrees as well. But I must respectfully dissent—as I did when he decided just before the election to spike our endorsement in the Presidential race—from his newly announced vision for the Opinions section. The section will focus, Bezos said, on “personal liberties and free markets.” More ominously, he added, “viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.”\n\nBezos owns the Post, and this decree is within his prerogatives. An owner who meddles with news coverage, especially to further personal interests, is behaving unethically. Shaping opinion coverage is different, and less problematic. But narrowing the range of acceptable opinions is an unwise course, one that disserves and underestimates our readers.\n\nThis is my forty-first year at the Post. I’ve spent more than half of them now on the opinions side of what we think of as the church-state divide, as a writer of unsigned editorials, a columnist, and, for a six-year stretch during the Bezos years, a deputy editorial-page editor, overseeing the op-ed pages.\n\nDuring that time, we had two fixed stars. First, an editorial page—the unsigned opinions that express the views of the newspaper—that was fiercely devoted to, yes, “personal liberties and free markets,” including the promotion of democracy at home and abroad. Second, an op-ed section—the signed opinion columns and other content—that embraced no orthodoxy. Instead, we consciously and assertively endeavored to present our readers with a range of views.\n\nWhen Trump arrived on the scene, with a perspective endorsed by tens of millions of voters, we broadened our conservative offerings to include that point of view. The theory—a theory that I believe Bezos not only accepted but cheered—was that readers would benefit from this diversity. They didn’t need to be told what to think.\n\nHow does the new focus on “personal liberties and free markets” fit into this? What “viewpoints opposing those pillars” consist of is a mystery. Compliance is in the eye of the beholder, whomever that might turn out to be. We have been assured by our interim managers that decision-making will proceed unchanged as we await a new opinion editor to implement the Bezos vision. But that is merely a postponement of sentence, unless we are to believe that it means no change at all, which does not seem to be Bezos’s intent.\n\nI’m devoted to free markets, but I also believe in the role of government in preserving competition in those markets, and the role of reasonable regulation in the service of protecting consumers, keeping planes in the sky, insuring clean water and safe drugs. Does my viewpoint undermine a Bezosian pillar or uphold it? I don’t know and I’m not sure how any editor overseeing the section is supposed to know. The better approach—the one we’ve always taken—is to have an array of views, helping readers formulate their own. Read George Will and Megan McArdle on regulation, then Catherine Rampell and Eugene Robinson. You decide.\n\nThe matter of personal liberties is similarly contested. Think about abortion rights. I believe fervently that women should have the right to control their own bodies—that this decision is a matter of personal liberty. But others believe with equal conviction that abortion is the taking of a human life. What more fundamental liberty is there than that? I have solicited and edited columns that argue for protecting fetal personhood. Which point of view passes the “personal liberties” test? Aren’t readers better off being exposed to both? You can go through the same exercise on gun rights and numerous other topics. My reasonable regulation is your infringement on the Second Amendment.\n\nAnd speaking of readers: We columnists owe them our best judgments on any particular issue. We ask them to trust that that is what we provide; that we aren’t being told how to think or what to say, or trimming our sails to stay out of dangerous waters. But, once the changes are implemented, I fear that readers will no longer be able to rely on such assurances, because Bezos, as I read his message, has told them they can’t. He won’t publish views that don’t conform to his principles. If that is somehow a misreading of the missive, please tell us. If not, the New York Times columnist David Brooks put it well on “PBS NewsHour” on Friday: “Jeff Bezos, when he says . . . we’re going to have an opinion section in the Washington Post that does not brook dissent, that’s just not journalism.”\n\nIt was one thing when the owner chose to dispense with Presidential endorsements. The editorial page, consisting of unsigned editorials, reflects the views of the owner. Signed opinions express the views of their creator. My job is supposed to be to tell you what I think, not what Jeff Bezos thinks I should think.\n\nAnd now comes the dicey part, because the Bezos missive does not arrive in a vacuum but in the context of the owner’s repeated overtures to Trump. Whatever his internal motivations, it is asking a lot of readers not to suspect that Bezos’s personal business interests play no role here.\n\nBezos has said that the Post is a “complexifier” for him, and he—for all the many good things he has accomplished for the Post—is a complexifier for us. By issuing this statement, in the midst of Trump’s assault on democracy, Bezos inevitably makes that complexity all the more difficult. “We must work harder to control what we can control to increase our credibility,” he wrote last October, after the decision to spike the Kamala Harris endorsement. It is hard to see how this edict helps. ♦",

        "full_text": "The federal government is undergoing a wave of job cuts across multiple agencies in 2025. Spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), these reductions have impacted many public sector employees, from environmental regulators to defense contractors.\n\nThis week, the Trump administration begins rehiring thousands of probationary workers, which incorporates Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of the Treasury, Department of Agriculture, Department of Defense, Department of Energy and Department of the Interior. It comes after Judge William Alsup ordered multiple government agencies to rehire them last week.\n\nThe wave of federal government layoffs in 2025 impacts tens of thousands of public sector workers. The cuts, part of President Donald Trump's broader effort to reduce government spending, have sparked concerns about economic instability, the strain on unemployment systems, and the disruption of essential government services.\n\nThe layoffs have already had significant consequences, affecting federal agencies, contractors, and even military installations. As the reductions continue, political, economic, and legal battles are intensifying over the legality and impact of these cuts.\n\nOver a dozen federal agencies have been impacted by layoffs thus far.\n\nLayoffs announced by U.S. employers jumped 245 percent in February, with federal government job cuts leading the surge, according to Reuters. Government agencies accounted for the bulk of these layoffs, with 62,530 federal workers dismissed in the first two months of 2025. That's a dramatic 41,311 percent increase compared to the same period in 2024.\n\nThe scale of layoffs has already started to overwhelm the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE) program, according to a CNBC analysis. The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, reported that the mass firings could result in significant delays for federal workers trying to access unemployment benefits.\n\nThe Department of Government Efficiency, led by billionaire Elon Musk, was created to oversee broad reductions in federal employment. Musk has defended the cuts as necessary to eliminate \"government bloat\" and improve efficiency.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News last month, Trump suggested that DOGE's cost-cutting measures could be Musk's greatest accomplishment, topping his efforts at Tesla and SpaceX.\n\nTrump's executive order about reshaping the workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency states that the administration will \"empower American families, workers, taxpayers, and our system of Government itself.\"\n\nA survey by polling firm YouGov indicated that support for DOGE has declined week over week. This comes as the Trump administration was ordered to reinstate federal workers that he laid off.\n\nSeveral federal agencies have been significantly affected by the layoffs.\n\nThe federal agencies that have been hit with layoffs include:\n\nIt is not immediately clear exactly how many federal workers have been cut in 2025. However, based on reporting by Newsweek and other media outlets, an estimated 222,000 job cuts have been announced this year, with more expected as federal agencies implement budget reductions.\n\nFederal contractors have also been impacted, and some private sector employers have laid off workers due to funding losses. Additionally, several state governments reliant on federal grants have begun to see secondary job losses.\n\nWhile some agencies have already seen extensive cuts, others are bracing for further reductions. Positions at risk include:\n\nThe Biden-appointed Merit Systems Protection Board has intervened in several cases to temporarily reinstate employees. On March 4, the board ordered the USDA to temporarily reinstate more than 5,000 probationary employees for 45 days while an investigation into the legality of their termination was conducted.\n\nWith lawsuits challenging the legality of some layoffs and Congress considering emergency legislation to provide financial assistance to affected workers, the future of these reductions remains uncertain.\n\nAs agencies scramble to adjust to reduced workforces, the long-term impact on public services and government operations is still unfolding.\n\nCheck back for the latest updates on federal employee cuts.\n\nUpdate 3/11/25 9:05 a.m. ET: This story has been updated with additional information.\n\nUpdate 3/12/25 9:20 a.m. ET: This story has been updated with additional information.\n\nUpdate 3/13/25 4 p.m. ET: This story has been updated with additional information.",

        "full_text": "Consumer prices remained relatively stable in February even as some economists have warned that prices could rise again amid Donald Trump’s trade war and stock markets have fallen on fears of a recession.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics latest Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks the prices of a range of goods and services, the annualized inflation in February was 2.8%, a 0.2% decrease from January’s year-over-year rate of 3%. The month-by-month price increase for all goods minus the volatile food and energy industries was 0.2%, compared with January’s 0.4%.\n\nThe egg shortage caused by the avian flu outbreak drove egg prices up 10.4% in February. Meanwhile, energy prices cooled a bit, rising 0.2% in February compared with 1.1% in January.\n\nWhile inflation has declined sharply from its peak just above 9% in 2022, price increases have remained above the Federal Reserve’s target rate of 2%. The closest inflation has gotten to the target rate was in September, when inflation hit 2.4%.\n\nThe Fed had spent the last few years adjusting interest rates in an attempt to gently lower inflation without hurting the labor market. At the end of last year, it seemed as if the Fed would achieve the so-called “soft landing”: prices were coming down, and the unemployment rate remained relatively low at around 4%. The Fed lowered interest rates three times last year. The central bank meets next week and is expected to leave rates unchanged.\n\nBut the slow and steady recovery from the inflationary heights reached after the Covid pandemic has been jolted by Donald Trump’s return to the White House. The president has stuck to his campaign promise to use tariffs against the US’s key trading partners, arguing they have taken advantage of the US and done too little to halt the flow of illegal drugs into the country.\n\nSo far, he has tacked on an extra 20% tariff on all imports from China and 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum exports from Canada. Threats of other tariffs, including a 25% tariff on all imports from Mexico and Canada, are still up in the air.\n\nThe instability of Trump’s trade policies has rocked US stock markets, which has cratered downwards over the last week.\n\nThe White House has batted away warnings that reactionary trade policies could destabilize the economy and even cause a recession. Wall Street went down even further on Monday, after Trump didn’t rule out a possible recession, saying on Sunday that the country is in “a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big”.\n\nThe Fed chair, Jerome Powell, has all but directly confirmed that the central bank will hold rates steady at its next meeting, on 18-19 March. In prepared remarks on 7 March, Powell said that the “costs of being cautious are very, very low” given that the economy is in a stable place – for now.\n\n“The economy’s fine. It doesn’t need us to do anything, really. And so we can wait, and we should wait,” Powell said.\n\nTaking pains to avoid any overtly political statements, Powell said that there is “heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook” but “it remains to be seen how these developments might affect future spending and investment”.",

        "full_text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Tuesday found that removing most grants and most staff from a U.S. federal agency that invests in African small businesses would be legal.\n\nU.S. District Judge Richard Leon also refused to extend an order blocking the Trump administration from removing the leaders of the U.S. African Development Foundation, which invests millions of dollars in African small businesses.\n\nUSADF is an independent agency created by Congress in 1980 and is controlled by board members who must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe case, filed by Ward Brehm, the president of USADF, raised questions about the extent of the president’s authority to remove board members and to reduce the size of the agency, which currently employs around 50 people.\n\nMaintaining USADF’s board, a president and one or two grants would “comply with the statutory requirements,” Leon wrote.\n\nHowever, he questioned whether the Trump administration had the power to install a board chair on a temporary basis.\n\nUSADF last week tried to keep staff from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency from entering their offices in Washington. DOGE staff managed to gain entry after returning with U.S. Marshals.\n\nLeon ordered the government to prepare those DOGE staff to explain to the court what steps they had taken to maintain the agency at “the minimum presence and function required by law.”\n\nThe judge said he would consider additional arguments for a block as the case unfolds.\n\nTrump last month in an executive order targeted USADF and three other agencies for closure in an effort to deliver on campaign promises to shrink the size of the federal government.\n\nAttorneys for the Trump administration have argued that USADF’s board has “done everything possible to avoid complying with the President’s clear directives,” and that “the President must be able to designate acting officials to fulfill his duty to enforce the laws.”\n\nCongress in 2023 allocated $46 million to USADF to invest in relatively small agricultural projects and energy infrastructure projects among other economic development initiatives in 22 African countries.\n\nIn court filings, USADF describes staff from DOGE demanding access to their systems, which staff denied citing privacy and security requirements. They also said DOGE emailed USADF’s staff last month announcing that Pete Marocco, the deputy administrator of USAID who has overseen its dismantling, would chair USADF’s board.\n\nMarocco and some of the same DOGE staff have succeeded in shuttering another independent agency, the Inter-American Foundation. On Feb. 28, a White House official told IAF staff that Marocco would chair the agency’s board, according to a letter sent to Congress by Eddy Arriola, the chair of IAF’s board.\n\nThe same day, Marocco held an emergency board meeting outside of IAF’s offices because he was not able to gain entry to the building. In notes entered into the Federal Register, Marocco said he designated himself the acting CEO and president of IAF, seemingly firing the sitting president.\n\nSince, IAF’s grants and contracts have been cancelled and most of its 37 staff members have been laid off. In 2024, IAF oversaw almost $350 million in investments in Latin American and the Caribbean, with a little more than half of that coming from outside funds, meaning from countries or private funders.\n\n___",

        "full_text": "Is the US really heading into a recession?\n\n8 days ago\n\nNatalie Sherman\n\nBBC News\n\nDuring his election campaign last year, Donald Trump promised Americans he would usher in a new era of prosperity.\n\nNow two months into his presidency, he's painting a slightly different picture.\n\nHe has warned that it will be hard to bring down prices and the public should be prepared for a \"little disturbance\" before he can bring back wealth to the US.\n\nMeanwhile, even as the latest figures indicate inflation is easing, analysts say the odds of a downturn are increasing, pointing to his policies.\n\nSo is Trump about to trigger a recession in the world's largest economy?\n\nMarkets fall and recession risks rise\n\nIn the US, a recession is defined as a prolonged and widespread decline in economic activity typically characterised by a jump in unemployment and fall in incomes.\n\nA chorus of economic analysts have warned in recent days that the risks of such a scenario are rising.\n\nA JP Morgan report put the chance of recession at 40%, up from 30% at the start of the year, warning that US policy was \"tilting away from growth\", while Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, upped the odds from 15% to 35%, citing tariffs.\n\nThe forecasts came as the S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest companies in the US sank sharply. It has now fallen to its lowest level since September in a sign of fears about the future.\n\nThe market turmoil is being driven partly by concerns about new taxes on imports, called tariffs, which Trump has introduced since he took office.\n\nHe has hit products from America's three biggest trade partners with the new duties, and threatened them more widely in moves that analysts believe will increase prices and curb growth.\n\nThe latest official inflation figures in the US showed the rate of price increases cooling in February, however.\n\nPrices were up 2.8% over the 12 months to February, down from 3% in January, the Labor Department said.\n\nStill, Trump and his economic advisers have been warning the public to be prepared for some economic pain, while appearing to dismiss the market concerns - a marked change from his first term, when he frequently cited the stock market as a measure of his own success.\n\n\"There will always be changes and adjustments,\" he said last week, in response to pleas from businesses for more certainty.\n\nThe posture has increased investor worries about his plans.\n\nGoldman Sachs last week raised its recession bets from 15% to 20%, saying it saw policy changes as \"the key risk\" to the economy. But it noted that the White House still had \"the option to pull back if the downside risks begin to look more serious\".\n\n\"If the White House remained committed to its policies even in the face of much worse data, recession risk would rise further,\" the firm's analysts warned.\n\nTariffs, uncertainty and slowing growth\n\nFor many firms, the biggest question mark is tariffs, which raise costs for US businesses by putting taxes on imports. As Trump unveils tariff plans, many companies are now facing lower profit margins, while holding off on investments and hiring as they try to figure out what the future will look like.\n\nInvestors are also worried about big cuts to the government workforce and government spending.\n\nBrian Gardner, chief of Washington policy strategy at the investment bank Stifel, said businesses and investors had thought Trump intended tariffs as a negotiating tool.\n\n\"But what the president and his cabinet are signalling is actually a bigger deal. It's a restructuring of the American economy,\" he said. \"And that's what's been driving markets in the last couple of weeks.\"\n\nThe US economy was already undergoing a slowdown, engineered in part by the central bank, which has kept interest rates higher to try to cool activity and stabilise prices.\n\nWhat are tariffs and why is Trump using them?\n\nSix things that could get more expensive\n\nIn recent weeks, some data suggests a more rapid weakening.\n\nRetail sales fell in February, confidence - which had popped after Trump's election on several surveys of consumers and businesses - has fallen, and companies including major airlines, retailers such as Walmart and Target, and manufacturers are warning of a pullback.\n\nSome analysts are worried a drop in the stock market could trigger a further clampdown in spending, especially among higher income households.\n\nThat could deliver a major hit to the US economy, which is driven by consumer spending and has grown increasingly dependent on those richer households, as lower income families face pressure from inflation.\n\nThe head of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, offered assurances in a speech last week, noting that sentiment had not been a good indicator of behaviour in recent years.\n\n\"Despite elevated levels of uncertainty, the US economy continues to be in a good place,\" he said.\n\nBut the US economy is currently deeply linked to the rest of the world, warned Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB.\n\n\"The fact that tariffs could disrupt that at the same time that there were signs that the US economy was weakening anyway ... is really fuelling recession fears,\" she says.\n\nStock market in tech ripe for correction\n\nThe unease in the stock market isn't all about Trump.\n\nInvestors were already jittery about the possibility of a correction, after big gains over the last two years, driven by the sharp run-up in tech stocks fuelled by investor optimism about artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nChipmaker Nvidia, for example, saw its share price jump from less than $15 at the start of 2023 to nearly $150 in November of last year.\n\nThat type of rise had stirred debate about an \"AI bubble\" - with investors on high alert for signs of it bursting, which would have a big impact on the stock market, regardless of the dynamics in the wider economy.\n\nNow, with views of the US economy darkening, optimism about AI is getting even harder to sustain.\n\nTech analyst Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management wrote on social media this week that his optimism had \"taken a step back\" as the chance of a recession increased \"measurably\" over the past month.\n\n\"The bottom line is that if we enter a recession, it will be extremely difficult for the AI trade to continue,\" he said.\n\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "full_text": "Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino.\n\nIn arguing for more tariffs on goods imported to the United States, President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that the U.S. was its “richest” or “wealthiest” during the late 1800s and early 1900s because of tariffs. In multiple ways, his claim is wrong or misleading.\n\nIn terms of the overall U.S. economy, real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product per capita is many times higher today than it was during the so-called Gilded Age, which was a post-Civil War period of economic prosperity – largely for the wealthy – amid the nation’s industrial expansion.\n\nIn addition, several economists have said that Trump and others have given too much credit to tariffs for the economic growth that did occur in America more than 100 years ago. For example, in a 2000 paper, Douglas Irwin, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College, wrote: “That tariffs coincided with rapid growth in the late nineteenth century does not imply a causal relationship.” Irwin and other economists and historians have said that other factors, such as immigration and increased labor productivity, contributed more to the growth in that era.\n\nBut the way Trump tells it, the U.S. was at its best economically many, many years ago, because tariffs, otherwise known as customs duties, were a significant source of federal revenue.\n\n“Our country is going to become rich again, very rich,” Trump said at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 22, when talking about new tariffs that he announced this year on imports from China and imports of steel and aluminum from all foreign countries.\n\nHe continued, “The word tariff is my favorite word in the dictionary. You know, we were richest, the richest, relatively, from, think of this, from 1870 to 1913. That was our richest because we collected tariffs from foreign countries that came in and took our jobs and took our money, took our everything, but they charged tariffs.”\n\nTrump has even made the dubious suggestion that tariffs could be used to replace the federal income tax, which became law in 1913, with the ratification of the 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Federal income taxes account for about half of federal revenue each year.\n\n“But you could wipe out your income tax. You could maybe not even have an income tax system when this thing works out,” Trump said while discussing tariffs at a dinner with Republican governors on Feb. 20.\n\n“Because in the old days that’s what happened. Our country was the richest ever from 1870 to 1913. That’s when we were actually the richest and we were a full tariff country.”\n\nTariff revenue accounted for no more than about 60% of federal receipts during that period, according to a 2024 analysis by the White House Council of Economic Advisers. And more importantly, economists have said that it’s highly unlikely that the U.S. could raise enough money from tariffs on imported goods to match current income tax revenues.\n\nIn fiscal year 2024, just 1.7% of the more than $4.9 trillion in federal receipts came from customs duties on imports.\n\nThe ‘Richest’ Claim\n\nWe don’t know exactly how Trump defines the terms “richest” or “wealthiest.” We contacted the White House press office, but have not received a response.\n\nWhen the New York Times wrote about Trump’s tariff remarks at this year’s CPAC, the newspaper said, “A White House spokeswoman noted [to the Times] that wages and the economy grew rapidly during the Gilded Age, but did not provide evidence of unparalleled prosperity in that era.”\n\nIn addition, based on real GDP per capita, Trump’s claim is false – because it is much higher now than it was more than a century ago.\n\nAs of 2022, it was $58,487 – nearly six times higher than $10,108 in 1913 and more than 12 times higher than $4,803 in 1870. That’s according to inflation-adjusted data from the Oxford University-based project Our World in Data, which calculated historical real GDP per capita based on international prices in 2011.\n\nTrump has said that, because of tariffs, the U.S. had “so much money” at that time that “we didn’t know what to do.” In that context, he may have been alluding to the fact that in many of the years between 1870 and 1913, the federal government had budget surpluses, which occur when federal receipts exceed outlays.\n\nThe president has also falsely claimed that the U.S. had “no debt” during that period, and he has often mentioned a legitimate debate that occurred in 1888 over what to do about excess federal revenue due to high tariffs. Democrats wanted to cut tariff rates to lower revenue while Republicans wanted to raise tariffs more to discourage imports and reduce revenue.\n\nBut the U.S. also has had surpluses in years when tariffs were a significantly smaller share of federal revenues — such as in the 1920s, which was after the federal income tax was enacted in 1913 and became the primary source of funding for the government by far.\n\n“This is just a function of government revenue growing faster than government spending,” Jeremy Horpedahl, associate professor of economics at the University of Central Arkansas, wrote about the surpluses in a February blog post about Trump’s “richest” claims. “And the growth of revenue during the 1870s and 1880s was largely driven by a rise in internal revenue — specifically, excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco (these taxes largely didn’t exist before the Civil War).”\n\nMost recently, the U.S. had four consecutive budget surpluses in fiscal years 1998 to 2001. At that time, tariffs made up about 1% of annual federal receipts.\n\n‘Other, Bigger’ Economic Factors\n\nIn general, some economists have said that supporters of tariffs, including Trump, have left the inaccurate impression that tariffs alone were the reason for the wider economic growth that occurred after the Civil War.\n\nFor example, in 2018, during Trump’s first term in office, Dartmouth’s Irwin did a podcast interview with American Enterprise Institute senior fellow James Pethokoukis, in which Irwin said said it was a “simplistic argument” to say that tariffs were responsible for rapid growth in the late 1800s:\n\nIrwin, Aug. 31, 2018: But when you look at that era actually in the late 19th century the U.S. was very open. We were open for immigration and we indeed had massive immigration. We were open to capital from the rest of the world and were able to borrow and purchase a lot of technology. So, it’s not as though we were an isolationist country with big barriers. Yes, we did have fairly stiff tariffs on imported manufactured goods, but otherwise we were very open to what was going on in the world economy.\n\nIn fact immigration, as I point out in the book [“Clashing Over Commerce: A History of US Trade Policy“], was actually a key instigator in terms of the development of many manufacturing industries in the United States. …\n\nIn addition, it’s become very hard actually to attribute U.S. economic growth in the late 19th century to those higher tariffs. A lot of the key improvements in technology and a lot of the growth was in the service sector: telecommunications, railroads, and things of that sort. Manufacturing really didn’t grow much as a share of GDP in the late 19th century. A lot of that grew actually in the pre-Civil War period when tariffs were actually much lower — only in the range of 20% or so.\n\nSo, there is the simplistic argument that one encounters a lot — that tariffs allowed us to grow rapidly in the late 19th century — but the more you look into it you see it’s a really tough case to make. A lot of other factors were involved and the tariffs were probably third or fourth order. And it’s not even clear they had a positive impact as opposed to a negative impact.\n\nIn his 2000 paper, Irwin said he found “that growth then was driven largely by labor force expansion and capital accumulation, while productivity growth was undistinguished when put in a comparative perspective.” He ultimately concluded that tariffs were “probably not a key factor.”\n\nLikewise, in a 2024 commentary piece, in which he cited work by Irwin and other economists, Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics and trade policy studies at the Cato Institute, wrote: “In sum, U.S. tariffs imposed after the Civil War likely helped some American manufacturers and harmed others, but they were generally neither a major driver of nor drag on the sector’s and economy’s growth, which was instead driven by other, bigger factors, such as increasing productivity and an expanding labor force.”\n\nLincicome said that “no one should expect tariffs – whether back then or today – to drive the U.S. economy given all the other, bigger factors at play and the fact that trade just is a relatively small share of economic output.”\n\nTariffs vs. Income Taxes\n\nEconomists have been just as critical of Trump’s suggestion that the revenue from higher tariffs could be a substitute for federal income tax collections.\n\nIn October, after Trump had suggested on a number of occasions that tariffs could replace the federal income tax, Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy for the Tax Foundation, wrote a column explaining why the math wouldn’t work.\n\n“Donald Trump has floated a proposal to replace the U.S. income tax system with a new system of tariffs, moving the United States back to the tax mix of the late 19th century. The plan, simply put, is a mathematical impossibility,” she wrote.\n\nYork noted that, in fiscal year 2023, the government collected $2.2 trillion from the individual income tax and only about $80 billion from tariffs. To make up the difference, Trump would have to impose an across-the-board tariff of 70% on all imported goods, she said.\n\nWhat Trump suggested “is unworkable because of the sharp difference in the size of the respective tax bases,” York wrote, noting that projected adjusted gross income was $15.6 trillion and goods imports were $3.1 trillion in fiscal 2023.\n\nSubstantially higher tariffs would also likely lead to a reduction in imports. “Trump’s calculation ignores the precipitous drop in imports a tax increase of this magnitude would cause,” she said.\n\nKimberly Clausing and Maurice Obstfeld, both senior fellows at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, made similar points in a June post that asked, “Can tariffs replace the income tax?”\n\n“Simply put, no,” was their answer. “It is literally impossible for tariffs to fully replace income taxes. Tariff rates would have to be implausibly high on such a small base of imports to replace the income tax, and as tax rates rose, the base itself would shrink as imports fall, making Trump’s $2 trillion goal unattainable.”\n\nClausing and Obstfeld said that scrapping the income tax in favor of higher tariffs would cause job losses, higher inflation, larger federal deficits and a recession.\n\n“It would also shift the tax burden away from the well off, substantially increasing the tax burden on the poor and middle class,” they argued.\n\nThe income tax is considered to be progressive because higher-income households have a higher tax burden. On the other hand, tariffs are considered to be regressive taxes because they affect lower-income households more than others as a percentage of income. U.S. importers pay the tariff, but the costs are usually passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.",

        "full_text": "There’s only one explanation for this topsy-turvy new reality in the Capitol, and it’s President Donald Trump.\n\nSeven weeks into his second term, Trump is redefining GOP orthodoxy in so many ways it’s difficult to keep track. He has shattered Republicans’ long history of muscular globalism in favor of an “America First” posture, sidelining an entire wing of the GOP. He’s leaned into protectionist economics in a way Republicans have long shunned and somehow convinced longtime free market champions to defend his policies as smart negotiating.\n\nBut the turnabout on the House floor has been especially stark. Without much drama at all, he’s convinced even the most skeptical Republicans to extend a spending deal negotiated in part by Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer — making them swallow the kind of long-term patch that both fiscal hawks and Pentagon cheerleaders have railed against for years.\n\nIt’s just the latest reminder: It’s Trump’s party, and what he says goes.\n\n“Normally I wouldn’t support the CR because I think it shows Congress is not doing our jobs,” conservative Rep. Eric Burlison (R-Mo.) told ABC News. But this time? “Trump is behind it.”\n\nIt’s not that Trump gave conservatives nothing. Many got face time, or at least call time with the president — like Burlison, who praised Trump and his staff for listening to his concerns before he agreed to get in line.\n\nAnd when I ran into Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.), one of the eight Republicans who ousted McCarthy, he pulled out a piece of paper to explain that the current bill cuts $7 billion in spending over the prior year.\n\nWhen I pointed out that was a drop in the bucket compared with the $1.6 trillion in discretionary spending that lawmakers would be extending, he sighed and agreed.\n\n“That’s not a lot of money, but it’s a start,” he said.\n\nSo if not the $7 billion, what got him to yes? Take a guess.\n\n“He’s never lied to me,” Burchett said about Trump, citing a conversation where the president promised to continue making cuts through his Department of Government Efficiency initiative.\n\nThere were through-the-looking-glass moments pretty much everywhere you went around the House on Tuesday. House Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris (R-Md.) showed up to a leadership news conference and said he was “100 percent behind this continuing resolution” — this from the leader of a group that made its name opposing GOP leaders’ spending deals.\n\n“This is not your grandfather’s continuing resolution,” Harris said, pointing to provisions that fund deportations, defense and veterans and allow DOGE to slash away at waste.\n\nHmm — okay.\n\nIt didn’t stop there. Republicans also on Tuesday almost unanimously approved a discreet provision tucked into the rule setting up the final floor vote on the spending bill. It effectively snuffed out their own ability as lawmakers to stop Trump’s emergency tariffs — tariffs that many of them railed against for years and, as they voted, were driving massive losses in U.S. financial markets.\n\nRepublicans argued the move was aimed at Democrats, who had filed privileged resolutions to terminate Trump’s emergency declarations, blocking them from being able to hijack the floor to force votes on the issue — votes that could force many swing district Republicans into an uncomfortable spot.\n\nBut by blocking Democrats, Republicans also willfully neutered their own authority, as Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) was all too happy to note on the floor.\n\n“They slipped in a little clause letting them escape ever having to debate or vote on Trump’s tariffs,” McGovern said. “Isn’t that clever?”\n\nI couldn’t help but think back to the Republican National Convention last July, when I asked Speaker Mike Johnson about how he, as a self-proclaimed free-trader, could be okay with Trump’s tariff threats. At the time, the Louisiana Republican suggested Trump’s threats were a “trial balloon” aimed at sparking debate.\n\n“I don’t think that’s President Trump’s plan,” he said at the time, promising “a lot of thoughtful discussion” and a “vigorous debate that we’ll all have” about trade policy.\n\nSome debate: Aside from McGovern’s diatribe, the tariff provision was barely mentioned on the floor Tuesday before Republicans approved it. Johnson earlier in the day defended Trump’s economic policy to reporters, saying the tariffs are needed to “start the process of repairing and restoring the economy.”\n\n“You got to give it time,” he said.\n\nYes, we’re only about 50 days into Trump’s second term, but this much we already know: With every passing moment, power is going only in one direction. And one day congressional Republicans might sober up and realize it’s not ever coming back.",

They believe these additional taxes will level the playing field.\n\nAmerica’s largest primary aluminum producer, Century Aluminum, applauded Trump’s initial reinstatement of a 25 percent tariff on primary aluminum imports in a news release last month.\n\n“President Trump’s decisive action will protect national security and help level the playing field for America’s aluminum workers,” Century Aluminum CEO Jesse Gary said.\n\n“On behalf of our employees, I thank President Trump for putting America first and strengthening the Section 232 tariffs, which will help drive the resurgence of domestic aluminum production,” Gary added.\n\nDespite concerns about an increase in the price of cars, some are in favor of the initiative.\n\nUnited Auto Workers Union president Shawn Fain told ABC News that tariffs will benefit his colleagues greatly.\n\n“Tariffs are an attempt to stop the bleeding from the hemorrhaging of jobs in America for the last 33 years,” Fain said, referencing the North American Free Trade Agreement, which began in 1992.\n\n“Tariffs aren’t the end solution, but they are a huge factor in creating, fixing the problem,” he added.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc.

        "full_text": "It would have been a dangerous drinking game during the Biden presidency to chug every time the media broadly described Jan. 6 protesters as \"insurrectionists.\" It didn't matter whether the protesters were violent or vocally supported overthrowing the government. That was the automatic journalistic assumption for every protester on the scene.\n\nSo it's remarkable when you consider the case of radical leftist Mahmoud Khalil and the group he led, Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD). On March 10, the network evening news shows didn't find an \"insurrectionist.\" They came rushing to his defense.\n\nThe Trump administration pulled Khalil's green card for his support for Hamas terrorism. Everything President Donald Trump does is reflexively opposed as unjust.\n\nNBC's Emilie Ikeda was vague: \"Khalil recently finished a masters at Columbia and helped lead pro-Palestinian protests on campus.\"\n\nABC's Aaron Katersky also said: \"As a Columbia University graduate student, Khalil helped lead pro-Palestinian protests and organized encampments that took over the campus for weeks last spring.\" Reporters pointed out his new American wife was pregnant, so Trump seems meaner.\n\nCBS reporter Lilia Luciano editorialized: \"You could feel the chill in the air which really matched the chill in terms of freedom of expression.\" CBS never found anything \"chilling\" in prosecuting nonviolent grandmas for \"parading\" in the Capitol.\n\n\"PBS News Hour\" correspondent William Brangham read from a Trump message on Truth Social that Khalil is \"a radical foreign pro-Hamas student\" who \"engaged in 'pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity.' Now, as I said, the administration has not provided any details alleging that he has said or done any of those things. We simply at this point do not know.\" They played dumb.\n\nThe New York Times on March 11 turned to Khalil's friends, who were \"describing him as kind, expressive and gentle.\" That's dramatically at odds with the Times reporting on CUAD on Oct. 9, 2024. They reported CUAD issued a statement calling the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre of innocent civilians a \"moral, military and political victory\" and quoting Ismail Haniyeh, the assassinated former political leader of Hamas.\n\n\"The Palestinian resistance is moving their struggle to a new phase of escalation and it is our duty to meet them there,\" the group wrote on Oct. 7 on Telegram. Earth to Media: They're pro-Hamas.\n\nThe Times noted CUAD rescinded an apology it made after one of its members said the school was lucky he wasn't out killing Zionists. \"We support liberation by any means necessary, including armed resistance,\" they said.\n\nKhalil has been routinely described as the \"lead negotiator\" for CUAD, but the \"no evidence\" gang at PBS somehow thinks you can't connect the dots between Khalil and CUAD. We can guess PBS reads and respects The New York Times, so they can't call this story \"disinformation.\"\n\nPBS pretends you can't find anything \"anti-American\" in CUAD's output. So it's embarrassing to note CUAD posted on social media, \"We are Westerners fighting for the total eradication of Western civilization.\" They suggest oppressed territories of the world including Hawaii, Guam, and Puerto Rico.\n\nThe New York Post reported Khalil was caught on camera at last week's hostile takeover of the Milstein Library at Barnard College: \"Videos and photographs posted on X depict him holding a bullhorn near the library entrance and engaged in discussion with school administrators.\"\n\nReasonable people can debate whether it is fair and reasonable to pull Khalil's green card and send him packing. But reasonable people should admit the reality that Khalil is an \"insurrectionist.\" He is a \"radical\" and an \"extremist.\" He embraces the murder of innocent civilians in the pursuit of \"liberation.\" He's not a kinder, gentler protester.\n\nTim Graham is director of media analysis at the Media Research Center and executive editor of the blog NewsBusters.org.",

We’re gonna make your lives s–tty.”\n\nCops blared a message on a loop warning protesters that if they remained in the roadway, they were going to be arrested and slapped with disorderly conduct charges.\n\nThe NYPD said late Tuesday one person was hit with disorderly conduct and obstructing governmental administration charges and another 11 were issued summonses.\n\nKhalil, at the center of a national firestorm, was detained Saturday by federal authorities and faces the threat of deportation for what the White House said Tuesday was peddling “pro-Hamas” views.\n\nThe arrest comes as President Trump has vowed to root out alleged antisemitism by foreign citizens on college campuses, including at Columbia, which has been a hotbed for fiery anti-Israel protests for the past year and a half.\n\nAbout 350 protesters started out at Washington Square Park earlier Tuesday and marched to Federal Plaza Immigration Court, grinding traffic to a halt multiple times as they chanted anti-Israel slogans and called for Khalil’s freedom.\n\n“There is only one solution, intifada revolution,” protesters crowed as the crowds grew to about 500.\n\nStay up to date on Columbia anti-Israel agitator Mahmoud Khalil\n\nAnti-Israel agitator Mahmoud Khalil denies feds’ claim that bedbugs drove him from NJ to Louisiana lockup\n\nWho is Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University agitator detained by ICE for deportation?\n\nColumbia anti-Israel agitator Mahmoud Khalil sues to block Columbia, Barnard from releasing student records to Congress\n\nNoor Abdalla, wife of Columbia anti-Israel agitator Mahmoud Khalil, says she was ‘naive’ to think he wouldn’t face arrest\n\nThe group was trying to make speeches in front of the federal courthouse in the middle of the street, but was ordered by the NYPD to keep moving. When the protest tried to enter City Hall Park, cops blocked marchers and forced them to turn around before the chaos unfolded.\n\nOne tourist visiting from Texas who saw the protest pass by her earlier Tuesday wondered why the protesters were hiding their faces with masks and Palestinian headscarves.\n\n“They’re embarrassed to show who they really are,” Andrea Benatar, 44, told The Post.\n\n“If they’re so proud of freeing Palestine, why not show their faces?\n\n“I’d like them to go and live in Gaza. They clearly have no sympathy for the Jewish people in Israel, including children, who were murdered and kidnapped,” she added.\n\nPolice officers also took a man into custody after he got into an argument with a protester.\n\nA demonstrator, Anastacia Symone, 30, claimed the man grabbed a young protester by the throat and took a swing at him.\n\n“I’m here to call for the release of Mahmoud Khalil. He was at home with his family when he was criminalized for expressing his freedom of speech,” Symone said.\n\nProtesters argued that Khalil was targeted because he is the “cornerstone in our community,” calling him a “political prisoner.”\n\n“The Trump administration and the complicit Columbia University believe if they separate us from this key cornerstone of our community, our movement will begin to crumble,” the protesters screamed.\n\nKhalil was being held in Louisiana ahead of a scheduled hearing before a federal judge Wednesday morning to determine the next steps in the highly controversial case.\n\nKhalil has a green card and is married to a US citizen, who is pregnant.\n\nHis legal team wants him returned to New York, arguing the federal government is “engaging in blatant efforts to target and chill” their client’s free speech and to “discriminate against particular viewpoints.”",

        "full_text": "President Trump’s sweeping tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum went into effect on Wednesday, inviting immediate retaliation from the European Union and escalating tensions with other trading partners reeling from his on-and-off approach to steep trade penalties.\n\nMr. Trump’s tariffs of 25 percent hit metal imports from every country that sells steel and aluminum to the United States. Many domestic steel and aluminum makers support the move, saying it will help protect their industry against foreign competitors. But the tariffs are expected to raise costs for American businesses that use foreign metals, including manufacturers of cars, canned food and drinks, solar panels and other products.\n\nSome trading partners have vowed to retaliate by issuing levies aimed at hurting U.S. exporters. Canada, a major supplier of metal in the United States, said that it would impose new retaliatory tariffs on $20 billion worth of American imports, including metals, computers and sporting goods. And the European Union swiftly announced tariffs on up to $28 billion worth of American goods, including bourbon, boats and motorcycles.\n\nThose conflicts could spiral into even bigger trade wars. Asked on Wednesday if he would retaliate against the E.U. tariffs, Mr. Trump said, “Of course I will respond.”\n\nMany other governments — like Japan, Australia, Mexico, Brazil and Britain — chose not to react, at least for now, for fear of worsening relations and the impact on their own economies. Those countries are also girding for the next round of Mr. Trump’s tariffs on April 2, when the president has said he will impose tariffs on foreign cars and countries that he says discriminate against the United States.\n\nMr. Trump’s recent trade moves have rocked stock markets and exacerbated concerns about the economy. Stock markets shifted between gains and losses on Wednesday as investors weighed concerns about tariffs against better-than-expected inflation data for February. Analysts have warned that Mr. Trump’s sweeping plan for tariffs could push inflation higher in the future and slow the economy.\n\nOn Monday, Goldman Sachs slashed its 2025 economic growth forecasts for the United States to 1.7 percent from 2.4 percent, citing adverse trade policy.\n\n“This may be the calm C.P.I. report before the storm,” said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, referring to the inflation data. She said that, with tariff policies, the inflation picture could potentially get “uglier as the months go on.”\n\nThe action on metals is just the latest attempt by Mr. Trump to leverage the power of tariffs and the American market against foreign governments. Last week, he issued steep tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China, blaming those countries for the entry of drugs and migrants into the United States, before quickly paring some of the tariffs back.\n\nMr. Trump’s approach has sent many U.S. allies into a defensive mode as they try to figure out how to mollify the president while also protecting their own industries. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump threatened to double the tariffs on Canadian metal after the province of Ontario responded to his previous tariffs by putting a surcharge on electricity exported to the United States. Within hours, Ontario had suspended its surcharge, and Mr. Trump walked back his threats.\n\nThe steel and aluminum tariffs restore and expand similar steps that Mr. Trump put in place in 2018, which ushered in several long-running trade spats. Mr. Trump argued that the tariffs were needed to protect national security and provide a reliable source of metal for the military in wartime.\n\nBut the metal tariffs mainly affect U.S. allies: Canada is by far the largest supplier of both steel and aluminum to the United States. Brazil, Mexico, South Korea and Vietnam also ship the United States significant amounts of steel, while the United Arab Emirates and China send the United States aluminum.\n\nSince Mr. Trump first issued the tariffs in 2018, both he and former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. made deals with foreign countries, including Brazil, Mexico, Canada and the European Union, that whittled away at the tariffs. The U.S. metals industry has complained that the measures were no longer strong enough to keep steel mills and aluminum smelters afloat.\n\nU.S. Steel, one of the country’s sole surviving makers of primary steel, has warned that it will need to shut down plants and lay off workers unless it finds a more deep-pocketed acquirer. The chief executive of Cleveland Cliffs, the country’s other primary steel maker, said that last year had been “the worst year for domestic steel demand” in over a decade.\n\n“Things would be, without those tariffs, much worse for the industry,” said Kevin Dempsey, the president of the American Iron and Steel Institute, an industry group.\n\nBecause steel and aluminum are used to make so many other products, however, tariffs that raise the price of the metals have consequences for many other manufacturers, and for the U.S. economy.\n\nBy increasing costs of basic inputs for many companies, the tariffs could harm factories that ultimately employ far more Americans than steel mills and aluminum smelters do. Economists say that could potentially backfire on Mr. Trump’s plans to bolster U.S. manufacturing.\n\nThe study found that the metal tariffs levied in 2018 encouraged buyers of steel and aluminum to purchase more from U.S. sources, led to higher domestic prices for metals and expanded U.S. steel production by about 2 percent between 2018 and 2021, the years the report studied.\n\nBut the analysis also found that the tariffs raised production costs for firms making automobiles, tools and industrial machinery, shrinking production in those and other downstream industries by about $3.48 billion in 2021. The steel and aluminum industries produced about $2.25 billion more in metals that year because of the levies.\n\nIn an effort to mitigate the harmful consequences on other industries that use steel and aluminum, the Trump administration has expanded its steel and aluminum tariffs this time to also protect various downstream goods, or “derivative products” made with metal, such as tractor parts, metal furniture and hinges.\n\nChad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a research organization, said that move was an “implicit acknowledgment” that some industries were suffering because of Mr. Trump’s previous tariffs.\n\nHe said that the tariffs created a “cycle of cascading protectionism” in which more industries would ask for government safeguards, and that it “may be difficult to stop” once it gets going.\n\n“Where does it end?” Mr. Bown asked.\n\nThe prospect of higher costs has also encouraged other U.S. industries, like automakers, to lobby for tariffs on their foreign competitors to protect their businesses. Mr. Trump has said he plans to levy a tariff on foreign cars on April 2.\n\nFor automakers, the metal tariffs threaten to raise costs when prices of new cars and trucks are already near record highs. The average price of a new vehicle in January was more than $48,000, according to Edmunds, a market research group.\n\n“Affordability is already a major concern for American car shoppers amid elevated prices and interest rates,” said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds.\n\nRobert Budway, the president of the Can Manufacturers Institute, a trade group that represents companies making cans for food, soda, beer and paint, said that tariffs would result in higher packaging costs, which would ultimately be passed to American consumers.\n\nSince Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on steel in his first term, food packagers have been relying more on imported metals, and simply paying more for them, Mr. Budway said.\n\n“It just makes the price higher,” Mr. Budway said.\n\nMajor American export industries, particularly farmers, will also be hit by retaliatory tariffs on billions of dollars of American exporters, including poultry, beef, pork and soybeans.\n\nCanadian officials said Wednesday that their retaliation would come in addition to a 25 percent tariff their government put on $30 billion of American goods this month in response to Mr. Trump’s prior levies.\n\nGabriel Brunet, a spokesman for the finance minister, Dominic LeBlanc, who is leading Canada’s trade response, said Canada was “ready to respond firmly and proportionately” to any U.S. tariffs.\n\nBritain’s trade secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, called the tariffs “disappointing.” The country was investigating steps to protect local producers and negotiating an agreement with the United States to eliminate additional measures, he said on Wednesday.\n\nBut Maros Sefcovic, the trade commissioner for the European Union, said during a news briefing Monday that the U.S. administration “does not seem to be engaging to make a deal.”\n\n“In the end, as it is said, one hand cannot clap,” he said.\n\nTrump officials have implied that, at least for the metal tariffs, deal making is not on the table. Asked what it would take to remove steel and aluminum tariffs, Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, said Wednesday that Mr. Trump views metals as “fundamental for our national security.”\n\n“The president wants steel and aluminum in America. And let me be clear, nothing’s going to stop that until we’ve got a big, strong domestic steel and aluminum capability,” he said.\n\nReporting was contributed by Neal E.

        "full_text": "The Education Department said Tuesday it will slim down to fewer than 2,200 employees, a nearly 50% reduction from what it looked like when President Trump took office.\n\nThe department said nearly 600 employees took buyouts and nearly 1,400 others will be notified they are on administrative leave.\n\n“Today’s reduction in force reflects the Department of Education’s commitment to efficiency, accountability, and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents, and teachers,” said Secretary of Education Linda McMahon.\n\nShe said all of the department’s divisions will see reductions, with some getting what she called a “significant reorganization.”\n\nIn a later interview on Fox News, Ms. McMahon said the department is shuttering its office doors on Wednesday as a security precaution. She said employees were told to take their laptops and phones with them.\n\n“Those that are coming back will know that they’ll be coming back on Thursday,” she said.\n\nThe Education Department is a relative newcomer to the Cabinet, having been created in 1980. It’s the third-youngest of the departments, older only than Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs.\n\nSince that creation, conservatives have targeted the department and question the federal government’s role in schooling. They argue that it has become a way to foist ideological fads onto local schools, who have to accept federal mandates along with Uncle Sam’s cash.\n\nDemocrats said the cuts were Mr. Trump’s first attempt at achieving such an abolition.\n\n“Ultimately, what they want to do is clear: fire the people who help our kids and gut funding for our students, teachers, and schools. This is about breaking government for working families — and enriching billionaires like themselves in the process,” said Sen. Patty Murray, the senior Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n\nMs. McMahon, though, said she’s not cutting any education. She characterized the moves as slashing bureaucracy and returning more decisions to local control and to parents themselves.\n\nShe said the department will continue to make payments on programs such as Pell Grants and student loans and on spending under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Those tasks, she said, are required by law.\n\nMs. McMahon was confirmed by the Senate last week and showed signs in her Fox interview of still getting up to speed. At one point she stumbled over what IDEA stood for.\n\n“You know what? I’m not sure I can tell you exactly what it stands for, except that it’s the programs for disabled and needs,” she said. “This is my fifth day on the job. I’m really trying to learn it.”\n\nThe department had 4,133 employees on Inauguration Day and will soon be down to roughly 2,183.\n\nThe department said 259 employees took the Deferred Resignation Program, dubbed the Trump administration buyout. Some 313 others took a $25,000 Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment.\n\nThe difference will be made up in the administrative leave announcements to come later this month.\n\nThose being let go will be paid in full up through June 9 and will get “substantial” retirement or severance pay based upon their time on the job.\n\nRep. Rosa DeLauro, Connecticut Democrat, called the staff cuts illegal.\n\n“No president or member of the executive branch has the authority to end public education, violate the law, and unilaterally steal dollars promised to students,” she said.\n\nBut Tommy Schultz, CEO of the American Federation for Children, said Ms. McMahon’s move is a blow to teachers unions “who care only about preserving their own power.”\n\n“This news is another signal that the bureaucratic state is coming to an end in America, ushering in a golden age in American education that is centered on sending education back to the states and parents,” he said.",

        "full_text": "One day ahead of a court hearing for Mahmoud Khalil -- the Palestinian activist who was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on the campus of Columbia University, despite possessing a green card -- his wife and attorney both released statements shedding more light on Khalil's detainment and the days leading up to it.\n\nKhalil's wife, who is eight months pregnant, issued a statement speaking of the outpouring of love she has received and the urgent need for him to be home in time for their baby's birth.\n\nIn it, she said that Khalil \"begged\" Columbia University for legal support one day before his arrest, explaining that he was fearful that ICE might target him.\n\nKhalil allegedly sent an email to the university urging them to intervene, his wife said.\n\n\"I haven't been able to sleep, fearing that ICE or a dangerous individual might come to my home. I urgently need legal support and I urge you to intervene,\" he reportedly said in his email.\n\nHis wife claimed that the university never responded.\n\nABC News reached out to Columbia for comment and has not independently reviewed the reported emails.\n\nKhalil's wife also said in her statement that a \"doxxing\" campaign began targeting her husband about six days ago and anti-Palestinian groups were also spreading \"false claims\" about him.\n\nShe recalled the moment she was also threatened with arrest when she refused to leave her husband with the agents, claiming that the couple was never shown a warrant.\n\n\"I was born and raised in the Midwest. My parents came here from Syria, carrying their stories of the oppressive regime there that made life unlivable. They believed living in the US would bring a sense of safety and stability. But here I am, 40 years after my parents immigrated here, and just weeks before I'm due to give birth to our first child, and I feel more unsafe and unstable than I have in my entire life,\" her statement said.\n\nThe Trump administration said it detained Khalil, who was a leader of the encampment protests on Columbia's campus, alleging he was a supporter of Hamas.\n\nBaher Azmy, one of the lawyers representing Khalil, called his client's alleged alignment with Hamas \"false and preposterous.\"\n\nAccording to a joint letter filed in court and obtained by ABC News, the government and Khalil's attorneys conferred on Monday but were unable to agree on how to proceed. Khalil's side asked the court to first decide a pending motion to compel the government to return him to New York; the government indicated that it intends to move to dismiss or transfer the case for improper venue and is asking the court to address that first.\n\n\"For everyone reading this, I urge you to see Mahmoud through my eyes as a loving husband and the future father to our baby. I need your help to bring Mahmoud home, so he is here beside me, holding my hand in the delivery room as we welcome our first child into this world. Please release Mahmoud Now,\" the statement from Khalil's wife concluded.\n\nAttorney Amy E. Greer said she spoke with Khalil on Tuesday and that he is \"healthy and his spirits are undaunted by his predicament.\"\n\n\"He also greatly appreciates, and, typically for him, is moved by the extraordinarily broad and steadfast support he has received from a variety of communities that understand what is at stake,\" she said.\n\nGreer also hinted that some of the administration's comments about Khalil, including President Donald Trump's social media posts, may be used by his legal team to argue for his release.\n\n\"The remarks by government officials, including the President, on social media only confirm the purpose – and illegality – of Mahmoud's detention. He was chosen as an example to stifle entirely lawful dissent in violation of the First Amendment. While tomorrow or thereafter the government may cite the law or process, that toothpaste is out of the tube and irreversibly so. The government's objective is as transparent as it is unlawful, and our role as Mahmoud's lawyers is to ensure it does not prevail,\" Greer said.\n\nThe court has scheduled a hearing on the habeas petition on Wednesday at 11:30 a.m.\n\nKhalil's team will be asking the court to order the government to return him to New York to while the legal battle plays out. Khalil is currently being held in Louisiana -- a move that Greer claimed is a \"blatantly improper but familiar tactic designed to frustrate the New York federal court's jurisdiction.\"",

        "full_text": "Dalvin Modore walked as if there were broken glass beneath his feet, stepping gingerly, his frail shoulders hunched against the anticipation of pain. His trousers had become so loose that he had to hold them up as he inched around his small farm in western Kenya.\n\nMr. Modore has tuberculosis. He is 40, a tall man whose weight has dropped to 110 pounds. He has a wracking cough and sometimes vomits blood. He fears the disease will kill him and has been desperate to be on medication to treat it.\n\nMr. Modore is one of thousands of Kenyans, and hundreds of thousands of people worldwide, with TB who have lost access to treatments and testing in the weeks since the Trump administration slashed foreign aid and withdrew funding for health programs around the globe.\n\nMany, like Mr. Modore, have grown significantly sicker. As they go about their lives, waiting and hoping, they are spreading the disease, to others in their own families, communities and beyond.\n\nThe whole system of finding, diagnosing and treating tuberculosis — which kills more people worldwide than any other infectious disease — has collapsed in dozens of countries across Africa and Asia since President Trump ordered the aid freeze on Jan. 20, Inauguration Day.\n\nThe United States contributed about half of international donor funding to TB last year and here in Kenya paid for an array of essentials. Trump administration officials have said that other countries should contribute a greater share to global health programs. They say the administration is evaluating foreign aid contracts to determine whether they are in the national interest of the United States.\n\nWhile some of the TB programs may ultimately survive, none have received any money for months.\n\nFamily members of infected people are not being put on preventive therapy. Infected adults are sharing rooms in crowded Nairobi tenements, and infected children are sleeping four to a bed with their siblings. Parents who took their sick children to get tested the day before Mr. Trump was inaugurated are still waiting to hear if their children have tuberculosis. And people who have the near-totally drug-resistant form of tuberculosis are not being treated.\n\nDespite being fully treatable, tuberculosis claimed 1.25 million lives in 2023, the last year for which data is available. If TB begins to spread unchecked, people throughout the world could become at risk.\n\nThe main TB research effort, testing new diagnostics and therapies, has been terminated. The global procurement agency for TB medications lost its funds, then was told it might regain them, but still has not. Stop TB, the global consortium of government and patient groups that coordinates tuberculosis tracking and treatment, was terminated, had the termination rescinded, but still has received no funds.\n\nThe United States did not pay for all the TB care in Kenya, but it funded critical pieces. And when those were frozen, it was enough to bring the entire system to a halt.\n\nThe United States paid for motorbike drivers, who earned about $1 for transporting a sample taken from a person with a presumptive infection to a lab to test it for TB. The drivers were fired on the first day of the funding cut — so the transportation of samples stopped.\n\nThe United States paid for some laboratory equipment used to process tests. In many places, processing stopped.\n\nThe United States paid for the internet connectivity that allowed many testing sites to send results back to far-off patients via local community advocates known as TB Champions. So even when patients found a way to send samples to a working lab, notification of results stopped.\n\nWithout testing that confirms whether a person is infected and what type of TB they have, family members cannot start on preventive therapy.\n\nThe United States paid for the half-dozen tests that patients need before beginning treatment for multi-drug-resistant TB, to make sure their bodies will be able to tolerate the harsh drugs. These tests can cost $80 or more, beyond the reach of many patients. Without the tests, clinicians don’t know what drugs to prescribe very sick patients. Prescriptions stopped.\n\nThe United States paid for the ships and trucks that moved drugs to ports and on to warehouses and clinics. Shipments stopped.\n\nEvaline Kibuchi, the national coordinator for the Stop TB Partnership in Kenya, predicted that it would take only three months before infections and deaths from TB increased. “But we won’t even know about the new deaths, because all the data collection was supported by U.S.A.I.D.,” she said.\n\nThe United States also paid the stipends — about $35 a month — of community health workers, and TB Champions, who lost the tiny salaries that belie their vital role. Research has shown that because TB treatment involves taking drugs for many months, often with miserable side effects, patients are much more likely to finish a course of medication and be cured when someone is checking on them regularly, cheering them on and watching for lapses.\n\nBut across Kenya, the community advocates have kept working, unpaid, covering the costs of trying to reach patients and delivering diagnoses out of their own pockets.\n\nMr. Modore’s constant cough drew neighborhood attention in January. Doreen Kikuyu, the TB Champion in his area, came and collected a sputum sample from him and used the motorbike system to send it for diagnosis.\n\nBy the time his results came back, the Trump administration had frozen the system. Ms. Kikuyu could not get funds for a motorbike to take her to his home to inform him. “But I could not leave him without knowing the answer,” she said. “So I set out walking.”\n\nShe also explained that the lab analysis did not provide information on whether he had a drug-resistant form, so he would need further testing before he could start the proper medication. But he would have to pay 1,000 Kenyan shillings — about $8 — to send a sample to the regional laboratory that could do this test. To pay for it, they might need to sell a chicken, one of their few assets. They debated what to do as the days ticked by.\n\n“I’m really hoping to start on medication but I’m just left wondering what will happen,” Mr. Modore said one recent afternoon, sitting hunched in the shade of a stand of trees outside his house.\n\nEventually, the intrepid Ms. Kikuyu managed to scrape together the money, by gathering contributions from other now-fired community health workers and neighbors. She sent the sample to the lab. Good news came back: Mr. Modore did not have drug resistance and could take the standard medications.\n\nBut there was no one to prescribe them. The staff members at the clinic were paid by the United States, and they were now fired. Ms. Kikuyu was at her wit’s end, knowing Mr. Modore was desperately ill.\n\nWorking her phone, using airtime she bought herself, she badgered a local government TB official who is a clinician to meet her at the hospital and to prescribe and issue the drugs from the shuttered clinic storeroom. She scraped together more money to bring Mr. Modore to the clinic on a motorbike. As she watched him grin and take his first pills, she felt a flood of relief.\n\nBut immediately, she faced a new worry: His family and close neighbors, about a dozen people, needed to start preventive therapy to protect them from getting sick too. The clinic is closed. If she can find a clinician to prescribe drugs for the adults, at least, she could deliver them. (TB drugs for children are complex and require a doctor’s supervision.) But she’s out of money to get back to the Modore home. She has worn herself out walking to the homes of other patients who are waiting for tests, waiting for results, waiting for drugs.\n\n“It’s a problem,” she said wearily. “But we have to get to that family.”\n\nFor TB treatment to work, patients must take their drugs every day, without interruption, for months.\n\nBarack Odima, a 38-year-old mechanic in Nairobi, has the most deadly form of the disease, one that is resistant to most treatments. Last fall he started on a rare drug combination, but when he went to pick up his medication two weeks ago, the clinic staff told him that one of the drugs had not been restocked and that they had nothing for him.\n\n“If I don’t get this drug that is missing, how will I be cured?” Mr. Odima said.\n\nAfter another week, the clinic received a small batch of medications. The clinician and the pharmacist had been laid off, so a TB Champion gave him the medication — but could not tell him how many more pills he might receive.\n\nWhile he is on the drugs, Mr. Odima is supposed to have monthly testing of his blood, liver and kidneys to make sure his body is tolerating them. That costs about $80, previously covered by the U.S. grant, and he has not had a test since the funding freeze. Mr. Odima’s wife and five children are supposed to be rechecked for the disease this month; it will take all his savings to pay for X-rays.\n\nIn an interview in a clinic treatment room plastered with stickers and posters advertising U.S.A.I.D. support, Mr. Odima said he was grateful to the United States for assisting with his treatment, but was baffled that the country had cut off help. Of course his own government should provide such care, he said. “But we are a dependent country,” he said, “and Kenya is not able to support the programs so that all the people with these diseases can get cured.”\n\nIn truth, the TB treatment system in Kenya was none too sturdy before the United States yanked its support — the country had nearly 90,000 new infections last year. Labs ran short of supplies to do molecular tests, and people were often misdiagnosed.\n\nThe TB Champions, who drop in to check in on anyone they hear about with a persistent cough, were intended as a low-budget, high-impact strategy to change that. Since the aid freeze, they have taken on outsize importance. In the scruffy western Kenyan town of Busia, a Champion named Agnes Okose is using the money she earns from her snack stall to fund trips to outlying villages. Since late January, she has been delivering diagnoses and collecting sputum samples in plastic sample jars she buys herself, toting them in a small lunch cooler to a laboratory in town.\n\nBut because all the TB and H.I.V. cases have gone to the separate clinics for years, clinicians in the main facilities don’t know about drug protocols, side effects or signs of treatment failure.\n\n“You will have health care workers who have never seen a TB case; there will be quality-of-care issues,” said Dr. Timothy Malika, who oversees the TB program of Kisumu County, which has one of the highest rates of TB infection in Kenya.\n\nAbigael Wanga, who lives in a village in Busia County, has five children; two have taken TB treatment for a year. But the two children, Philemon, 8, who hopes to be a pilot one day, and his headstrong sister Desma, 3, still have chest pain and coughs, and no appetite.\n\nMs. Okose fears they are drug-resistant. She collected sputum samples from them and their three siblings the day before the inauguration. The testing is frozen, and all five children continue to sleep under one blanket at night.",

        "full_text": "With Congress acquiescing to all of Trump's wishes and the courts stacked in his favor, many are concerned about an unbridled president. To the rescue comes the market.\n\nBy Sergei Klebnikov and Matt Schifrin\n\nThis past Thursday, President Trump did it again–and so did the financial markets. In a Truth Social post, Trump said that he would be carrying through next week on his previously delayed threat to slap 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods because (he said) these neighbors weren’t doing enough to stop drugs at the border. Then, in the oval office later, he said China would get hit with an additional 10% levy—taking the total to 20%. The market’s response was swift and unambiguous. The S&P 500 closed down 1.6% for the day, taking it into negative territory for 2025, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ closed down 2.8%, off 3.8% for this year. By contrast the MSCI European stock index is up nearly 11% and MSCI China stock index has gained 17%.\n\nWhat the erratic 47th President will do next week is an open question. But investors can at least be sure, based on his performance both during his last term and this one, that Trump is paying attention to the market. On February 1, after he initially signed three executive orders declaring these tariffs, stocks plummeted the next morning. They recovered a few days later after Trump “paused” what a majority of economists view as an ill-conceived proposal.\n\nA failure of checks and balances. A strongman presidency. Constitutional crisis. After just a few weeks in office, these are the words echoing in the halls of power as President Trump and Elon Musk steamroll through federal agencies. So far, there’s no pushback from a Republican controlled Congress and it’s unclear if the judiciary will intervene. Given his fake news rhetoric, Trump is certainly not worried about media reports, traditionally a strong external check on presidential power. After all, his own supporters don’t trust the mainstream media.\n\nBut there is one authority that President Trump seems to recognize: the market.\n\n“Trump is a president who has more closely aligned his own success with the stock market than any other president in US history,” says Jeremy Siegel, a Wharton emeritus professor and WisdomTree senior economist. “The market is the ultimate check, especially for a president who cares.”\n\nWhile stocks surged higher following Trump’s reelection in November, cracks have now started to emerge in the rally. Along with stocks, Bitcoin prices have retreated 20% from their Trump-infused highs.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, his announcement of 25% tariffs on China in March 2018 caused markets to tank nearly 5% in a week. While that escalated into an all out trade war with China in 2019, by 2020 Trump backed down and signed a trade agreement.\n\n“It is instructive that in the trade war in his first term, Trump was willing and able to pivot when the economic damage caused by that war became apparent, easing tensions with the Chinese,” wrote Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi in a recent report. “We expect a similar dynamic this time as well.”\n\nGrowing up in Queens, New York–and for decades seeking the approval of Manhattan’s market rich elite–Trump has many Wall Street billionaires within his inner circle. So it is hardly any surprise that he has always been highly sensitive and attuned to financial markets and their movements. In December, Trump triumphantly rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange while standing in front of his 2024 Time “Person of the Year” cover. (It was his first time ringing the bell, and he brought along his children and Vice-President Elect J.D. Vance for the occasion.)\n\nThe bond market may be an even more important check than the stock market for Trump, especially considering that the nation’s $36 trillion in debt needs continual refinancing. There is no greater cautionary tale than the experience of short-lived British Prime Minister Liz Truss. After taking office in September 2022, she boldly announced she would slash taxes and ramp up borrowing. This widespread fear over inflation and mounting debt quickly caused bond prices to plummet, sending yields sky high as the British pound plunged to a record low against the U.S. Dollar. With several pension funds on the brink of default, the Bank of England had to announce three emergency interventions to save the bond market. Within three weeks, Truss had scrapped her tax cutting plan and resigned.\n\nWhile the prospect of a United States President resigning over a drubbing by the capital markets is farfetched, Truss’ implosion is instructive. Bond vigilantes are likely to keep President Trump on his toes. Things like the adherence to the rule of law matter a lot to the entities that buy and hold United States government paper.\n\nIn terms of interest rates, 10-year Treasury yields have come down since Trump assumed office from about 4.8% to around 4.2% today. However, mortgage rates (and inflation) remain problematic. According to Freddie Mac, 30-year fixed home mortgage rates, which recently rose above 7%, are hovering around 6.76% today.\n\nRight now the Trump administration is riding on the coattails of the Biden Administration’s strong economy, which averaged about 3.6% GDP growth from 2021 through 2024. That compares to Trump’s 1.5% average annual GDP growth during his first term.\n\nThe test will come if President Trump encounters a real crisis, not of his own making, like the Financial Crisis of 2008, which occurred at the end of President George W. Bush’s second term. As is often the case during times of economic turmoil, the market guided the nation’s leadership. When the House of Representatives in 2008 voted down the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) bailout on September 29, the S&P 500 plunged nearly 9% in four days before members of the House reconsidered the plan and approved the bill on October 3.\n\nDuring Trump's first term he tried to downplay the Covid 19 pandemic but the global shutdown, and a stock market plummeting more than 30% in a matter of weeks, jolted his administration and Congress into action. The result was $5 trillion in stimulus over two years, that buoyed markets then and ever since.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES\n\nForbesBillionaires Don’t Want Trump’s Golden VisaForbesTrumpiverse: Ranking Trump’s Inner CircleForbesForbes Post-Election Investment Guide: Protect Your WealthForbesIgnore Musk’s And Trump’s Wild Claims.

Fewer than 60,000 people live on the island, and most are part of an Indigenous Inuit background, while around 10% are Danish or Nordic. Trump has said he wants the U.S. to have access to the island’s rich mineral deposits.\n\n“I think most of us have been scared since the new year because of (Trump’s) interest,” Pipaluk Lynge, a member of parliament from the ruling United Inuit party, told The Associated Press. “So we’re really, really looking to Europe right now to see if we could establish a stronger bond with them to secure our sovereign nation.”\n\nTraffic jams, huge crowds and lots of foreign media characterize Greenland’s elections\n\nVoters have turned out in abundance to make their voices heard. According to reports, roads are clogged with those trying to get to the polls. Party volunteers are passing out drinks and Greenlandic treats in an effort to entice voters to stop and talk. Large numbers of foreign reporters, including from places as removed from Greenland as Japan and Croatia, are on the island.\n\n“All these reporters are frightening to us,’’ said voter Aviaja Sinkbaek. “It means that something must be happening soon. I wonder what Trump has up his sleeve.”\n\nSome Greenlanders have expressed interest in expanding Greenland’s business relationships.\n\nThe populist Naleraq party, led by candidate Qupanuk Olsen, is advocating for independence while also pressing for security agreements with foreign nations like the United States, per Fox News.\n\nSuch proposals may not be enough to sway Trump from his dreams of expansion, although 85% of Greenlanders say they do not want to join the United States according to a January poll.\n\nGreenland’s current left-leaning ruling party, led by Prime Minister Mute Egede, has indicated staunch opposition to Trump. His party is expected to prevail in the Tuesday election.\n\nTrump’s interest in Greenland\n\nTrump’s interest in Greenland is rooted back to 2019, when he first suggested buying Greenland, per AP News.\n\nIn addition to annexing Greenland, Trump has suggested:\n\nAnnexing Canada as the “51st state.” Trump has repeated his desire to appropriate Canada multiple times. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has indicated that he is taking Trump seriously and has criticized him fiercely for his remarks.\n\nTaking control of the Panama Canal.

We are ready to INVEST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS to create new jobs and MAKE YOU RICH.”\n\nHe then added: “If you so choose, we welcome you to be a part of the Greatest Nation anywhere in the World, the United States of America!”",

        "full_text": "Next month, Ecuadorian voters will choose between incumbent conservative President Daniel Noboa and progressive challenger Luisa González to be their next president. This will be the second presidential election of 2025, following the February general election in which no candidate secured the 50 percent needed to win outright(Noboa and González both earned about 44 percent of the vote).\n\nNoboa, Ecuador's youngest president and heir to a banana empire, took office in 2023 to complete the term of former President Guillermo Lasso, who dissolved the National Assembly that year—for the first time in Ecuador's history—to avoid an impeachment vote for his alleged role in a corruption scandal involving oil and gas contracts.\n\nNoboa inherited a tumultuous situation—from 2018 to 2022, Ecuador's murder rate quadrupled. Just two months into office, he declared a 60-day state of emergency in seven of the country's 24 provinces. The order designated 22 criminal gangs as terrorist groups, allowed the military to patrol streets, and authorized security forces to \"enter homes and intercept correspondence in the targeted provinces without prior authorization,\" reported Reuters. In January, Noboa issued a second 60-day crime emergency.\n\nThese policies initially led to a drop in the homicide rate, which fell by 17 percent through August 2024. However, the decline was short-lived—January was the most violent in Ecuador's history, with 731 homicides reported, according to InsightCrime, a nonprofit that tracks crime in Latin America.\n\nUnder Noboa, Ecuador's economy fell into recession, largely due to an energy crisis caused by droughts that reduced the country's supply of hydropower—its main source of electricity. As a result, blackouts lasted up to 14 hours a day, costing an estimated $12 million in lost productivity and sales for every hour without power. In the fourth quarter of 2024, gross domestic product fell by 1.5 percent year-on-year, while the poverty rate increased by 2 percent.\n\nIf reelected, Noboa plans to double down on tough-on-crime policies, including the construction of a $52 million, 800-person maximum-security prison to house the country's most dangerous drug lords, which he authorized in June 2024. His economic agenda focuses on resolving the energy crisis—though details remain vague—and reducing poverty by expanding social programs and wealth transfers, such as the \"Bono de Desarrollo Humano,\" which provides stipends of $55 to $150 to impoverished families.\n\nLuisa González, who ran against Noboa in the 2023 election, was handpicked by former President Rafael Correa (2007-2017). Correa was sentenced to prison in absentia in 2020 on corruption charges, according to the Associated Press.\n\nDespite her close ties with Correa, González has stated that she would not intervene in his legal matters and has denied any intention to pardon him if elected.\n\nGonzález plans to address Ecuador's crime wave similarly to Noboa—through a strong military and police presence—by fully deploying security forces to the borders to regain control and targeting drug lords.\n\nGonzález has also campaigned on reinstating the Ministry of Justice, Human Rights, and Worship to improve rehabilitation programs. The ministry, created during the Correa administration, was responsible for coordinating the justice system, overseeing human rights within prisons, and improving rehabilitation efforts for inmates. However, it was dismantled in 2018 as part of a government initiative to reduce spending and downsize the government. After its dissolution, prison responsibilities were transferred to the National Comprehensive Service to Prisoners and Juvenile Offenders. Since then, there have been several human rights accusations of the treatment of prisoners.\n\nHer economic plans include transitioning Ecuador to a post-oil economy—despite oil meeting 82 percent of the country's energy needs—and increasing social spending, signaling a return to Correa-era policies. Specifically, she plans to expand social spending in violent areas, reduce the sales tax from 15 percent to 12 percent, and provide tax credits for women-owned businesses.\n\nDespite their differing economic strategies, both candidates advocate expanding state power in the name of public safety. Regardless of the outcome, voters may suffer if these policies are implemented.",

        "full_text": "I was open to the idea behind Gavin Newsom’s new podcast, in which the California governor has been breaking out of his political bubble to talk at length with right-wing media stars such as Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon. Democrats need to get better at speaking to people who don’t share their assumptions and at long-form conversations requiring improvisation and spontaneity. They need to be willing to take risks and to use conflict to generate attention.\n\nNewsom himself did just that in 2023 when he debated Ron DeSantis on Fox News, drawing almost five million live viewers, plus 700,000 more for the replay. Trying to leverage Kirk’s and Bannon’s notoriety to reach new audiences could have been an interesting experiment.\n\nInstead, it’s a protracted exercise in self-harm for both Newsom and any liberal who decides to listen to him. That’s because the governor frequently seems less interested in arguing than in finding common ground, assuming the good faith of people who have next to none. He leaves wild right-wing claims unchallenged and repeatedly concedes Republican premises. When Bannon described rebuilding his movement after what he claimed was the stolen 2020 election, Newsom’s response was, “Well, I appreciate the notion of agency.”\n\nWhat could have been a show of intellectual confidence on Newsom’s part has turned out to be a demeaning display of submission.\n\nListening to the first three episodes of the podcast, “This Is Gavin Newsom,” I got the sense that Newsom had learned exactly the wrong lesson from Donald Trump’s 2024 election. Part of the reason Trump won, it’s true, is that he was able to appeal to increasingly alienated, right-wing young men through podcasts and new media. As Newsom told Kirk, the governor’s 13-year-old son is one of his fans. “We’re getting clobbered,” Newsom said at one point, and “you’ve figured something out.”\n\nBut while there is, in fact, a lot that Democrats can learn from Kirk and Bannon about building alternative media channels, there is nothing to be gained by flattering them or seeking mutual understanding.\n\nIn his podcast’s debut episode, Newsom asked Kirk to describe his professional trajectory. The story that Kirk told contained some important omissions. Yes, he built a following in part by charging onto left-leaning college campuses and challenging his opponents to debate, thrilling conservative students who felt ostracized by their progressive peers. But Kirk was misleading in presenting Turning Point USA, the organization of young conservatives he founded, as the “ultimate start-up,” created without money or connections.\n\nAs a teenager, Kirk was mentored by the Tea Party activist Bill Montgomery, who described himself as Turning Point’s co-founder, and the group got seed money from the evangelical megadonor Foster Friess. There’s obviously a genuine audience for what Kirk is selling, but he wouldn’t have become such a political powerhouse without wealthy and influential figures cultivating him over many years.\n\nThat’s the lesson for Democrats. Their donors should be making long-term investments in their own influencers, and Democratic politicians should be helping them grow their audiences by appearing on their platforms. Somehow, this is something Democrats never quite learn.\n\nMore than 20 years ago, the Democratic strategist Rob Stein put together an enormously influential PowerPoint presentation called “The Conservative Message Machine’s Money Matrix,” laying out how right-wing donors supported an interlocking network of think tanks, policy institutes, nonprofits and media ventures. But while Democratic donors have tried, at times, to create a similar infrastructure on the left, they tend to be more fickle and less willing to nurture and sustain a pipeline of young talent.\n\nOutlets like Air America and ThinkProgress that helped start the careers of important figures in the liberal firmament — Rachel Maddow among them — have been allowed to wither and die, and then Democrats wonder where all their young voices are. Rather than try to ingratiate himself with Kirk, Newsom might try to elevate the progressives who could someday compete with him.\n\nIt was especially ill advised for Newsom to roll out his pivot on trans women in sports in a conversation with Kirk, a man who once described trans people as “disgusting, mentally ill, neurotic, predatory freaks.” As a matter of both political expediency and simple honesty, Democrats should be able to acknowledge that it’s unfair to expect elite female athletes to compete against trans women who’ve gone through male puberty. But at a time when the Trump administration has singled trans people out for persecution, Democrats need to couple their recognition of physical difference with a broader defense of trans rights.\n\nInstead, Newsom emphasized how much he and Kirk agreed about. “The issue of fairness is completely legit,” he said. “So I completely align with you. And we’ve got to own that.”\n\nIf the governor was aware of the things Kirk has said about trans people, he should have called him on it. If he wasn’t, perhaps it’s because it takes work to prepare to engage a demagogue and Newsom already has a full-time job.\n\nFuture guests on “This Is Gavin Newsom” will include liberals; an episode with Tim Walz has already been recorded. But I suspect that by starting his show the way he did, Newsom has done lasting damage to his standing among Democrats, who are desperate for leaders who will fight on their behalf, not seek communion with their enemies.\n\nLast week I got an email from Michael Green, a history professor who ended up on a McCarthyite Turning Point watch list because he’d said mean things about Trump. “I had thought of Newsom as a possibility if we have a presidential election in 2028,” wrote Green. “He just lost me. Completely.” I doubt Green’s alone.",

        "full_text": "“Universal injunctions have reached epidemic proportions since the start of the current Administration,” acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris told the high court Thursday.\n\nThe Trump administration and its allies argue that the tactic of blocking executive actions nationwide early into litigation — paired with what is known as “forum-” or “judge-shopping,” in which plaintiffs seek out favorable courts — has been used to obstruct executive authority, a problem that has persisted long before Trump first took office in 2016.\n\n“It’s an issue that’s been ongoing in a large way, for about 20 years,” Cassandra Burke Robertson, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University, told the Washington Examiner. “I think it is well past time for a congressional solution.”\n\nHow are nationwide injunctions and judge-shopping tied together?\n\nMany of the challenges to Trump’s policies have landed in friendly jurisdictions, though often not by accident. District courts that fall under the purview of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, known for its liberal rulings, are one example of a common target destination for liberal advocacy groups and Democratic attorneys general.\n\nAlso on Thursday, U.S. District Judge William Alsup, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton in California, issued a sweeping order requiring six federal agencies to reinstate immediately thousands of probationary employees fired by the administration last month. When the administration appeals, it will move to the 9th Circuit for review. The lawsuit is backed by the State Democracy Defenders Fund, a left-leaning group headed by Norm Eisen, a staunch Trump critic and Democrat.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt criticized Alsup’s decision in a statement Thursday, saying, “The President has the authority to exercise the power of the entire executive branch — singular district court judges cannot abuse the power of the entire judiciary to thwart the President’s agenda.”\n\nConservative litigants have also engaged in similar tactics in the past. In 2023, Texas-based U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, ruled in favor of anti-abortion activists seeking to ban the abortion pill mifepristone, a move that enraged abortion-rights advocates and led to similar left-wing complaints about forum shopping. However, the Supreme Court eventually unwound the decision, finding plaintiffs lacked standing to sue, after the conservative-leaning 5th Circuit partially upheld Kacsmaryk’s original decision.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee, warned in 2020 that nationwide injunctions create an “asymmetric” legal battlefield in which any policy can be halted by one judge, even if others would uphold it.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, expressed similar frustration last week after the Supreme Court declined to block a single district court judge’s order forcing the Trump administration to pay $2 billion in foreign aid.\n\n“Does a single district-court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the Government of the United States to pay out (and probably lose forever) 2 billion taxpayer dollars?” Alito wrote in a scathing dissent, calling the majority’s decision “stunning.”\n\nTrump’s recent nationwide setback over DEI\n\nAdding to the frustration, a recent ruling by U.S. District Judge Adam B. Abelson, an appointee of Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden, further illustrates the stakes of judges heavily using nationwide injunctions.\n\nIn a challenge to Trump’s executive orders (EO 14151 and EO 14173), Abelson on March 11 expanded his preliminary injunction blocking the anti-diversity, equity, and inclusion policies across all federal agencies — not just the ones named in the lawsuit.\n\nSupreme Court has a chance to address this problem\n\nThe Supreme Court faces a chance to rein in nationwide injunctions later this year. In Garland v. Texas Top Cop Shop, justices may decide whether lower courts have overstepped their authority in halting federal policies.\n\nThe case centers on a Texas judge, Amos Mazzant, an appointee of former President Barack Obama who ruled that a federal law requiring businesses to disclose ownership information was unconstitutional. But Mazzant went further — he issued a nationwide injunction preventing the government from enforcing the law at all.\n\nJust before Trump took office, the Biden administration urged the Supreme Court to reexamine Mazzant’s decision. While the merits of the case involve the Corporate Transparency Act, an anti-money-laundering law, experts say an outcome in which the CTA is upheld could result in advising trial judges to issue more targeted orders that apply solely to the plaintiffs involved.\n\nThe push for legislative reform\n\nIn a statement echoing Alito’s concerns, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told the Washington Examiner the ability for a single district judge to “unilaterally micromanage the executive branch should raise eyebrows.”\n\n“Both parties have raised serious questions about district courts’ use of temporary restraining orders and universal injunctions to issue sweeping, nationwide policy mandates, and I think Congress ought to closely examine the issue,” Grassley added.\n\nRobertson, the law professor, told the Washington Examiner an easy solution could in the hands of Congress, such as with legislation requiring three-judge panels for plaintiffs in district court who are seeking nationwide injunctions.\n\n“I think part of the issue is actually driven by the congressional gridlock we’ve seen on policy issues for the last 20 years,” Robertson said. “That has really pushed both Democratic and Republican administrations to do more by executive order and through administrative actions.”\n\nRobertson’s proposal would mandate that cases involving nationwide injunctions be heard by a panel of two district judges and one appellate judge from the same circuit. The goal is to reduce the influence of outlier judges and make it harder for plaintiffs to pick judges in district courts that may be more prone to favor them.\n\nFor example, the Fort Worth Division has two conservative judges, making it a prime venue for right-wing challenges to Democratic policies. In contrast, Portland, part of the District of Oregon, has six judges across multiple divisions, and its liberal-leaning judiciary makes it a favored venue for left-wing lawsuits against Republican policies.\n\n“When a single judge can grant a nationwide preliminary injunction, it makes it easier for parties to identify the very few outlier judges who do rule more predictably,” Robertson said. A similar legislative approach has been floated by Article III Project founder Mike Davis, a staunch ally of Trump.\n\nBoth Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), a ranking member of the committee, and Grassley have raised issues with nationwide injunctions and judge shopping. In April 2024, Durbin received calls from progressive groups urging him to use his oversight authority to address the issue.\n\nGrassley told the Washington Examiner that he hopes “to explore the topic further through a future hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee,” and said he was “actively working towards a legislative solution.”\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nTRUMP BATTLES ‘FORUM SHOPPING’ AMID LIBERAL LAWSUIT SURGE\n\nLegislative efforts remain uncertain. While proposals from both Robertson and Davis signal a possible fix to the bipartisan concern, past attempts, such as a Senate Democratic bill that would have randomly assigned cases, have stalled in Congress.\n\nAs Trump now faces over 100 lawsuits against his executive agenda, the fight over judicial power is far from over.",

        "full_text": "In the past week, Donald Trump announced that he would buy a Tesla and advertised the company’s vehicles at an event that turned the White House lawn into a showroom benefitting his ally, Tesla CEO Elon Musk. He also said that vandalizing Tesla cars — as some demonstrators have done to protest Musk — will be labeled an act of “domestic terrorism.”\n\nIt’s the latest and perhaps most egregious example of the conflicts of interest that have ensnared both Trump and Musk, who is leading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a role that has given the world’s richest man the ability to target and gut any government agency that draws his ire.\n\nThis isn’t anything new. Trump’s first term was riddled with unprecedented conflicts of interest. Yet this time around, Trump came into office with even more business entanglements and ways to use the presidency to enrich himself. His social media company, Truth Social, is now a publicly traded company, giving anyone the ability to become a shareholder in the president’s business. He and his family members have launched crypto coins. And Trump also has a new set of merchandise licensing deals.\n\nBut when it comes to just how unprecedented the conflicts of interest are in this administration, the Tesla incident shows that Musk is the new elephant in the room. The businessman, who became one of the president’s closest advisers after spending hundreds of millions of dollars to help Trump win, is now directly influencing agencies tasked with regulating his own companies. And of course other Trump appointees and nominees — from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to Dr. Mehmet Oz, Trump’s pick to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services — are not free from conflicts of interest either.\n\nAt this point, the public seems resigned to the fact that people in power also have massive incentives to enrich themselves. But in truth, there are people and processes that are supposed to protect us from this kind of abuse. What are they, how have they broken down, and how can we get them to work?\n\nHow the government polices itself\n\nA conflict of interest arises when an official’s personal interests can cloud their judgement when making decisions on behalf of the public. When foreign officials, for example, spend money at Trump’s businesses, they create a conflict of interest for the president because he materially benefits from his relationship with them. And while some conflicts of interest are inevitable and not inherently corrupt, they do increase the risk of corruption, where officials intentionally advance their own personal interests instead of national ones.\n\nEvery branch of government has ethics standards and conflict of interest rules. Though as the ethics scandals with Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas have shown, they’re not always enforced.\n\nIn the executive branch, conflicts of interest are determined by statutes that apply to all federal employees — like the law prohibiting someone from working on matters where they have a financial interest — and ethics rules that are set up by the White House.\n\nOne major limitation, though, is that these conflict of interest laws do not apply to the president or vice president, which is why Trump is allowed to maintain all of his businesses while serving in the White House.\n\nAs for Musk, there’s a reason he hasn’t been subject to the same ethics standards as most other government employees. “The administration has taken pretty significant steps to insulate Mr. Musk from accountability,” said Donald Sherman, the executive director and chief counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). “So they made him a special government employee instead of a permanent employee, so he’s working for the federal government while also maintaining his day job.”\n\nThe administration has pointed to that special status — usually given to short-term advisers who sit on temporary advisory committees or task forces — as a reason why Musk doesn’t have to make his financial disclosure form public, limiting scrutiny into his businesses’ entanglements. (Past administrations have also dubiously granted people special government employee status, as was the case when Huma Abedin worked as an aide to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton while maintaining an outside consulting job.)\n\nSo who is responsible for actually enforcing existing conflict of interest rules where they can be applied?\n\n“Primarily that has been — within the executive branch — the Office of Government Ethics,” said Eric Petry, who serves as counsel in the Brennan Center’s Elections and Government Program. “There’s also a robust system of inspectors general, who are supposed to expose fraud and waste and conflicts.”\n\nThe Office of Government Ethics (OGE) was formed after the Watergate scandal. Before then, conflict of interest cases were mostly handled through criminal investigations and proceedings, but OGE was established to help prevent conflicts of interest from arising in the first place. Tasked with scrutinizing the president’s political appointees, the office reviews their financial disclosures, identifies areas where conflicts of interest might arise, and proposes ethics agreements to address those conflicts, including by requiring appointees to sell assets. OGE also maintains a database of officials’ disclosures, which are generally available to the public.\n\nInspectors general also play an important role. They are an independent watchdog within a given agency and conduct audits and investigations to ensure that the agency and its employees are complying with the law and to prevent fraud and abuse. While their investigations usually come in the form of a public report, inspectors general can also make referrals to the Department of Justice, where criminal violations can be prosecuted.\n\n“But,” as Petry notes, “you’ve seen the Trump administration has really been putting those systems under stress or just outright ignoring them.”\n\nIndeed, Trump has engaged in a full-on assault on these watchdogs, firing the director of OGE as well as at least 17 inspectors general across various federal agencies. Trump’s moves also underscore the potential conflicts of interest at play. At least one of the inspectors general he fired was overseeing an investigation into one of Musk’s companies. To put it mildly, these firings — which are potentially unlawful — are a major setback for the executive branch’s ability to police itself.\n\nObviously, that’s by design. From day one, Trump has shown little interest in promoting ethical conduct. One of his first executive orders, for example, rescinded Biden-era ethics rules that prohibited employees from accepting gifts from lobbyists. To be sure, while other administrations haven’t exactly been squeaky clean, the way the Trump administration has handled ethics concerns is a departure from its predecessors.\n\n“Unfortunately within the executive branch, some of the tools that we typically look to to police conflicts are not going to be effective,” Petry said. “So that means we look to the other branches of government.”\n\nCongress and the courts need to step up\n\nThis administration’s flagrant disregard for ethics rules underscores that the regulations we already have are clearly not enough. “It’s a real problem that federal conflicts-of-interest laws don’t apply to the president and vice president,” Petry said. “That’s something that Congress can and should change. There are problems here that are sort of systemic that require reform.” After Trump left office in 2021, there were some efforts to bolster ethics standards and oversight, and ensure that the president and vice president are no longer exempt from conflict of interest rules. But those efforts largely failed.\n\nStill, the different branches of government have to make an active effort to hold each other accountable. Since Trump has undermined the ability of the executive branch to hold itself accountable, the Congress and the courts have to be more vigilant.\n\nIt might seem like it’s expecting too much of a Republican-controlled Congress to investigate potential conflicts of interests, but that’s the legislative branch’s job. It’s also not unheard of. During Trump’s first term, Republican lawmakers oversaw inquiries into the president’s appointees. Former US Rep. Jason Chaffetz, of Utah, for example, called out Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, for potentially violating the law for not properly disclosing payments from foreign governments. (Flynn pleaded guilty for lying to law enforcement, but the Department of Justice eventually dropped its case against him and Trump granted him a pardon in 2020.)\n\nWhere Congress falls short, the courts can step in. Trump’s firing of the inspectors general, for example, is improper because he neither gave Congress a 30-day notice, as required by law, nor provided a substantive reason for the inspectors general dismissals. So some of those inspectors general have filed a lawsuit against Trump, saying their firing was “contrary to the rule of law.”\n\n“Unfortunately this moment of chaos could be really painful for a lot of people, but hopefully it will generate the backlash and public momentum for changing the system that we saw following the Gilded Age, following Watergate, following other periods of crisis and constitutional uncertainty,” Petry said.\n\nThat’s why the last line of defense against the conflicts of interest plaguing the Trump administration is important. And that is the role of the press and government watchdog groups.\n\nTrump has been able to evade accountability in part because he is more immune to public shaming than other public officials. His corruption has always been brazen and often out in the open. As a result, many people seem desensitized to this kind of abuse of presidential power.\n\nBut while public shaming might not work as effectively on Trump, it can pressure other officials and institutions to take action. Even when there aren’t specific remedies to Trump’s or Musk’s conflicts of interest, shedding light on them for the public to see is an important accountability mechanism because people can demand more of their representatives in government and put pressure on the administration. So the public shouldn’t be resigned to the idea that ethics rules are somehow moot under Trump.\n\nAfter all, that’s who lawmakers will have to answer to come election time. And it’s likely that voters will have some questions about who this administration is really serving.\n\n“You don’t need to be an ethics expert,” Sherman, of CREW, said, “to have significant questions about how this administration is operating and whether or not conduct rises to the level of a violation of federal or criminal law.”",

        "full_text": "Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino.\n\nAs we reported in January, President Donald Trump inherited a resilient economy experiencing continued growth in jobs, including an increase in full-time workers. But Republican Sen. Rick Scott recently painted a much different picture, calling the pre-Trump economy “crappy” and falsely claiming that full-time employment was “dropping almost the entire Biden administration.”\n\nThe U.S. senator from Florida made the claim during a March 9 interview on CNN’s “State of the Union.” After the show’s host, Jake Tapper, asked Scott about Trump’s recent admission that the president’s economic policies may cause “a little disturbance” for Americans, Scott began his response by first blaming former President Joe Biden.\n\n“Well, first off, Donald Trump walked in with a crappy economy,” Scott said. “The number of full-time jobs has been dropping almost the entire Biden administration. This is a lot of work.”\n\nWe asked Scott’s Senate office for the source of his claim, but we did not receive a response.\n\nHe’s wrong about full-time employment, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\n\nWhen Biden left office in January, the number of people usually working full time — meaning 35 hours or more a week — was almost 135.9 million. That was up 8.5% from about 125.2 million full-time workers when Biden became president in January 2021, during the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic that began in March 2020. In February, that figure dropped to about 134.7 million.\n\nNotably, the January 2025 total is higher than the February 2020 pre-pandemic level of almost 130.9 million usual full-time employees. (The monthly job figures come from a survey based on the pay period that includes the 12th of the month.)\n\nIf Scott was thinking of monthly job losses, there were 17 months under Biden in which the number of full-time workers declined on a month-to-month basis. But full-time employment grew the other 31 months of Biden’s term, resulting in a net increase.\n\nFor additional context, the share of workers usually working full time was 80.7% in 2023, the most recent annual BLS data available. In 2022, it was 81.9%; in 2021, Biden’s first year in office, it was 81.8%; in 2020, the first year of the pandemic, it was 80.9%; and in 2019, prior to the pandemic, it was 80.8%.\n\nAs for Scott’s claim that Trump took over a “crappy economy,” that is part of a GOP narrative suggesting that Trump has to repair an economy in poor condition.\n\nIn a March 11 House Republicans’ press briefing that touched on Trump’s tariff policies, Speaker Mike Johnson said that Trump has “to reshape and shape things because it’s in a real mess” after “four years” of “a disaster in economic policy and every other measurement of public policy.”\n\nDuring his March 4 address to Congress, Trump made the exaggerated claim that he “inherited, from the last administration, an economic catastrophe.”\n\nTo be sure, the state of the economy wasn’t perfect when Trump began his second term. But it wasn’t “crappy” or a “catastrophe,” either. In our January article “What Trump Inherits, Part 2,” we mentioned a number of economic indicators that could be interpreted as positive.\n\nWe reported that Trump was reclaiming “a resilient economy that has grown by at least 2.5% every year since he left office in early 2021”; “a post-pandemic jobs boom that has driven the unemployment rate well below the historical norm”; “inflation that has come down significantly in the past two years, but has been creeping up as of late”; and “a stock market that has made huge gains since he was last president.”\n\nIn a March 12 interview with NewsNation, Maryland University professor and economist Peter Morici also noted that “inflation has come down quite a bit” — from 9.1% in the 12-month period ending in June 2022 to 2.8% in February — and “the economy was growing well” under Biden.\n\nAnd back in December, IBM Vice Chair Gary Cohn, who was the director of the White House National Economic Council during Trump’s first term, said in an interview on CBS’ “Face the Nation” that Trump was inheriting a “very stable economy” with “real solid economic growth,” “real job growth” and “real wage growth.”\n\n“This notion that he inherited a bad economy is just silly,” Morici said, referring to Trump.",

        "full_text": "‘He’ll Do the Hard Thing’\n\n“Everybody has that voice in their head,” John Thune once told a reporter from the Rapid City Journal. He was talking about his father. “He’s kind of that voice inside my head,” he said, “the one that knows where the lines and the boundaries are.”\n\nHarold Thune was born in Mitchell, South Dakota, on Dec. 28, 1919. The son of an immigrant from Norway — Nikolai Gjelsvik became Nick Thune when he arrived at Ellis Island in 1906 — he grew up on the high plains in Murdo, a small, sparse, windswept spot in which earlier settlers had sought shelter in huts made of sod. He was a basketball standout, first leading Murdo to the state championship game, then becoming at the University of Minnesota the most valuable player on the team. At a Minneapolis soda shop he met a Canadian-born clerk who’d lost her railroad-worker father in accident when she was not yet 3. Harold Thune and Yvonne Patricia Bodine got married after he’d enlisted in the Navy after Pearl Harbor, and he was sent to the Pacific after that. He flew more than 60 missions off the USS Intrepid. In his Grumman Hellcat he downed four Japanese Mitsubishi “Zeros” and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. “You always wanted to keep the enemy off your tail,” he once said. The Japanese military’s “‘Zero’ was a lighter plane and could outturn the planes that we flew.” One way to win a fight, he learned, was to rely on experience and nerve. Another way, he came to believe, was to try to not have one in the first place.\n\nOn many mornings Thune’s mother sang in the house in her soprano. The sun is a-rising to welcome the day. High-ho! Come to the fair! “She had a way,” Thune would say, in the Murdo Coyote newspaper, “of making you like the day, whether you wanted to or not.” She had her kids read, even in the summer, an hour every day. She saw to it that they took piano lessons before school. Thune’s father saw to it that they did the lessons right. He sat with them to make sure. His father, Thune once said, didn’t like “ball hogs.” He didn’t like people who prized “personal glory.” The best members of a team, his father stressed, did what they did for “the good of the team.” The best members of a team, he believed, made the other members better.\n\nThune as a basketball star missed the last shot he took. It was the end of a one-point loss to the archrival in the championship of the district. “It wasn’t like it was a cupcake shot. It was a long ways away,” Brian O’Reilly, one of his teammates, told me. “Everybody in the gym knew John was going to get the ball, and of course they double- and triple-teamed him, and he tried his best,” Chris Venard, another one of his teammates, told me. “I don’t think anybody blamed him,” he said. “He blamed himself.” He sat alone in the locker room until his coach and his mentor tapped him on the shoulder. “John,” Jerry Applebee said, “it’s time to get on the bus.”\n\nThe motto of Jones County High School’s Class of 1979: “Today, we follow; tomorrow, we lead.”\n\n“John has always wanted to serve and to do what’s right,” his father once told a reporter. “He told me if the hard thing is the right thing to do,” he said, “he’ll do the hard thing.”\n\n‘John’s a Follower’\n\nHe conceded.\n\nThe real beginning of Thune’s long electoral career could have been the end. He was already better than a decade deep in his political life. From the mid-’80s to the mid-’90s, he’d been an eager aide to Republican Sen. James Abdnor, a special assistant for the U.S. Small Business Administration, the executive director for the South Dakota Republican Party and the South Dakota Municipal League, the state railroad director.\n\nIn 1996, he’d run for Congress and won. “There’s an old saying that organizational change comes from gentle pressure relentlessly applied,” he told NPR. “You do things incrementally. And you do it in a fashion that promotes,” he said, “a spirit of cooperation, and that’s really the only way you can get things accomplished.”\n\nAnd in 2002, in his third term in Congress, he’d thought about running for governor, but President George W. Bush helped sell him on a run for the Senate — a potential pivotal vote in an evenly cleaved chamber. But in the end, he’d lost to Tim Johnson, the incumbent Democrat — by 524 votes. Some whispered of rumors of fraud on the Native American reservations in the state. Thune spurned calls to challenge the results. He did not, he said, want to put South Dakota “through a lengthy recount which would not guarantee my victory or fix any irregularities” and “would be painful for the state and unlikely to change the outcome.”\n\n“He competes. I mean, he competes,” Karl Adam, a lobbyist in Pierre who’s a longtime Thune friend, told me. “But John’s not a disruptor.”\n\nAlso, though, Thune “set himself up” for a run to come, Fox News’ Michael Barone said at the time, “by not being a poor loser.”\n\nAnd so two years later, he decided to run again — this time, though, against Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader who had been the Senate majority leader, the top Democrat in Washington. It was seen as a very tall task, and at stake was his political career — lose for the Senate for the second time in three years and he was probably done. But it was “a race that needed to be run,” Thune said at the time. “He just felt,” Dick Wadhams, his campaign manager, told me, “it was the right thing to do.”\n\nBush was running against John Kerry for president, but the New York Times dubbed Thune-Daschle “the other big race of 2004.” The thrust of Thune’s case: After 26 years in Congress, Daschle had lost touch with South Dakota and become too Washington-enmeshed. “There is negativity and partisanship going on in Washington, and Daschle has become a symbol of why things don’t get done,” Thune said in a fundraising letter. “I’m proud to be a member of my party,” he said in an ad, pitching himself as a more independent option. “But … no party is right all the time.”\n\nDaschle countered by saying Thune had had a chance to oppose Bush a couple years before during a flap about a dearth of federal drought relief for South Dakota. In a debate on NBC’s Meet the Press, host Tim Russert asked Thune why he hadn’t more forcefully called that out. He had, Thune replied, shared his concerns — in private. Daschle suggested that wasn’t enough. “John’s a follower, and I think there’s something to be said for following, but you’ve got to be more than a follower in the United States Senate,” Daschle said.\n\nThune won. He beat Daschle by 4,508 votes — a little more than a percentage point — the first time in 52 years a sitting Senate leader had lost. It marked a lasting shift in the political makeup of South Dakota — a resolutely conservative state that throughout the latter half of the 20th century nonetheless had sent its fair share of Democrats to Congress. Not anymore. “That was kind of it for the Democrats in South Dakota,” Tony Venhuizen, the current lieutenant governor, told me. Time magazine labeled Thune a “Giant Killer,” and the Sunday after the election, he was on ABC’s “This Week” as the Republican counterpart to the Democrats’ new leading light — Senator-elect Barack Obama.\n\nIn Washington, in his first term in the Senate, Thune carried on with an approach he’d established in his six years in the House, according to staffers, allies and watchers of Congress from both parties. He scheduled with fellow members dinners or Bible studies. He had an uncanny capacity to remember names — aides, colleagues, spouses and kids. He was known as a good boss, conspicuously minimal churn on his staff, people who worked for him often working for him for an unusually long time. He was reliably ready in the halls of the Hill to banter with reporters to make and maintain rapport. He listened more than he spoke. He waited and he watched. Seldom was he a first mover. “He’s a skilled hunter,” Kyle Downey, his top communications adviser early in his Senate tenure, told me, “so he’d often say, ‘Let’s just keep our powder dry.’”\n\nIn 2008, he not only endorsed John McCain for president but campaigned for him. There was more than political admiration. There was something of a personal connection. His father had received his Distinguished Flying Cross Award from McCain’s grandfather. And Thune was on the list for the vice-presidential nod — the one that went instead to Sarah Palin. In 2010, he was reelected without opposition. And he thought hard about running for president heading toward 2012. “If he wins the nomination, it will be because he is an exceptionally skilled retail politician who can communicate a kind of midwestern, common sense conservatism that is ascendant in reaction to liberal profligacy,” Stephen F. Hayes wrote in The Weekly Standard. Mitch McConnell was a fan. “I think he’s the complete package and is the kind of person who could conceivably go the distance in a race for the presidency,” McConnell, then the Senate minority leader, told Hayes. The GOP field was open. Obama, seeking his second term, seemed vulnerable.\n\n‘A Very Challenging Time To Be In Public Life’\n\nAnd then down the escalator came Trump.\n\nThune at first didn’t think much of Trump’s run. He didn’t think it would last. “A short-term phenomenon,” he said that summer of 2015. “He’s someone who grabs attention,” he said, “but does he have the potential to go the distance?”\n\nAs Trump, though, started to surge, Thune started to shift — even if the shift was slight. “There is no denying that Donald Trump has struck a chord with voters throughout the country,” he said. “It has been the summer of Trump for sure,” he said. “But,” he said, “I think there will be other people who will emerge.”\n\nThey did not. And by December, when Trump floated the notion of banning Muslims from entry into the country, National Journal asked the question: Is there a line Trump can’t cross with Republicans? Thune in effect was inclined to leave it to the voters. Trump’s comments about Muslims were “not consistent with the values and beliefs that we hold as a nation,” he said. “I think in the end,” he also said, “we will nominate a candidate that can lead our party in the general election.”\n\nThat, in 2016, is what happened — just not how Thune thought it would. He didn’t go to the Republican National Convention. He spoke up when Trump attacked Gold Star parents who spoke out against Trump at the Democratic National Convention. “Donald Trump,” Thune said, “has to develop a thicker skin, realize that these campaigns and elections are not about him. It’s about the future of this country.”\n\nAnd in early October, in the wake of the shock of the Access Hollywood tape, Thune was the seniormost Republican to finally in essence answer that National Journal question. Here was the line. Trump, he thought, should leave the race — “should withdraw,” Thune said in a tweet, “and Mike Pence should be our nominee effective immediately.” Thune said the recording was “more offensive than anything I’ve ever seen.” But even this answer came with a clause: If, he said, the top-of-the-ticket GOP option remained Trump, Thune would vote for Trump.\n\nSo he did, and so, of course, did nearly 63 million others, and so in 2017 Thune established a certain template to the way he dealt with and talked about Trump. Trump’s baseless insistence that he’d won the popular vote and desire for an investigation into fraud? Thune “had not seen any evidence” of that, but “we’ve moved on,” he said in January. Trump’s eye-opening and unsubstantiated charge that former President Barack Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower? “Boy, I have no idea,” Thune told POLITICO in March. Trump’s quest to quash Obamacare? “We are proceeding according to plan,” Thune said in May. “But,” he said, “less drama on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue would be a good thing.” And so it went — Thune backing Trump in his health care-repeal and tax-cut initiatives while lamenting his inveterate feud-picking and wanly wishing he would stop tweeting, eventually settling on a sort of Pavlovian posture that was pragmatic, or acquiescent, or both. The man from Murdo didn’t not push back against the man from Manhattan — he just didn’t call him out. Thune was no sycophant — nor, though, was he some stance-taking crusader.\n\nThune’s M.O. was a dependable level of trying to find the thinnest of middle grounds that some found measured and others found milquetoast. It wasn’t always outright equivocation. But it was also never downright condemnation. Once at a concession stand at a basketball game in South Dakota a man told him he wasn’t sufficiently pro-Trump and he turned around and another man said he wasn’t suitably anti-Trump. “I know a lot of people are unhappy with him, and they vent a lot to me on a regular basis, too, but what they have to understand is he was elected by a big majority in South Dakota,” Thune said that summer at the Brown County Fair. “To me,” he told a reporter from the Aberdeen American News, “it’s about being a realist, and to be a realist about my work. I know what it takes to get things done in Congress, and I know that it takes a president to sign legislation into law, and we’ve got to be able to function together to do that.”\n\nThat didn’t change in 2019, and neither, really, did Thune — now the GOP whip. “I wish he wouldn’t tweet as much,” he said in January. “There are concerns, and our members are conveying those,” he said in February. “A bridge too far,” Thune said in March of Trump’s proposal to declare a national emergency to get money to build more border wall. He tried to get Trump to back off of tariffs. He expressed disapproval of Trump’s conduct that led to his first impeachment but also the Democrat-led impeachment itself. He voted to acquit. “There is a real concern out there that the behavior of the president … obviously isn’t what some of our members would condone, but at the same time it didn’t reach that threshold that would allow him to be removed from office,” he said on the PBS NewsHour. But was what the president did, he was asked, wrong? “At this point,” Thune said, “it’s kind of a discussion that is past us.”\n\nAnd as the first Trump administration careened toward its chaotic conclusion — the pandemic, the murder of George Floyd and the fallout, the president’s increasingly manic comportment — Thune urged him to listen to health professionals and to strike a tone that was more “calm,” more “reassuring,” more “empathetic.” When Trump wouldn’t commit to a peaceful transition of power? Thune said that couldn’t happen. “Republicans believe in the rule of law,” he said in September. “We believe in the Constitution.” And in November, after Trump lost, Thune balked at helping him challenge the certification of his defeat. “It’s just not going anywhere,” he said. “I mean, in the Senate, it would go down like a shot dog.” Trump responded on Twitter as if Thune were a declared enemy: “He will be primaried in 2022, political career over!!!” Trump said — at which point Thune shifted some. “We are letting people vote their conscience,” he told reporters at the Capitol. “This is an issue that’s incredibly consequential, incredibly rare historically and very precedent-setting,” he said. But then Jan. 6, 2021, happened. It seemed for a moment that Trump indeed was done and done for good, and Thune, in turn, seemed to rediscover his resolve.\n\n“Today,” Thune said on Jan. 6, “has been a sad day for America. The violent behavior at the Capitol is inexcusable and disgusting, but we won’t be deterred from our Constitutional duty. We need to work together to protect our democracy. Please pray for our country.”\n\n“Our identity for the past several years now has been built around an individual. You got to get back to where it’s built around a set of ideals and principles and policies,” he said. “I think people — including the president and others around him and other voices and in media circles and social-media platforms — have been putting out false facts and then getting people to believe those things now for weeks,” he said, “and it’s just time for it to stop.”\n\nAnd yet in the subsequent and second impeachment Thune voted again to acquit. “What former President Trump did to undermine faith in our election system and disrupt the peaceful transfer of power is inexcusable,” he said. But impeachment, Thune explained, was meant for removal from office, and Trump was already out of office, and impeaching him after his ouster, he argued, would take the power out of the hands of the voters.\n\nIt had been a long four years. “There was just kind of a shift in 2016 where everything just kind of changed,” a former Thune staffer told me. “Just all the things … got harder.” Thune thought hard about not running for reelection in 2022. One reason was the chance to spend more time with his wife, his daughters and his grandkids — but another was Trump, the durability of his political viability, the looming possibility or even probability of his return.\n\nHe made his choice. He ran again.\n\n“He saw,” Mike Rounds, his fellow senator from South Dakota, told me, “there was a possibility of becoming the leader …”\n\nHow long had Thune wanted to be leader?\n\n“I think,” Rounds said, “he’s wanted to be a leader since he got here.”\n\nBut he wanted to be the Senate majority leader working with a Republican president who wasn’t Donald Trump. In the 2024 primary — after Rounds did the same — Thune endorsed Tim Scott.\n\nBut Trump won the South Carolina primary on Feb. 24 and with it for all intents and purposes the GOP nomination. Thune called him that night. He endorsed him the next day. And he announced his candidacy for leader a week later. He made a trip to Mar-a-Lago shortly thereafter. He said he’d worked with him before. He said he could work with him again.\n\n“We’re more animated these days by the personality of Donald Trump, and that’s the reality we live with and deal with if you want to be involved in public life,” Thune said after he announced his bid to succeed McConnell. “That’s kind of where our voters are,” he said. “And you have to listen to your voters.”\n\n“God wants us to be out there being salt and light in the culture,” he said when he won. “I want to be a hopeful, optimistic leader,” he said, “a leader who’s willing to do hard things, make hard decisions.”\n\n‘My Guess Is That He’s at Least Somewhat Tortured’\n\nThe fire in the fireplace in the office of the leader on the Senate side of the Capitol was smoking. The eyes of the wall-mounted head of a bison named Murdo were watching. The other day, toward the tail end of 10 straight weeks of the Senate in session, going on two months into the second Trump term and with the specter of a government shutdown in the air, the trim Thune wore a blue suit and sat down to talk.\n\nI asked him about that voice in his head of his dad. The one that knows where the lines and the boundaries are. “People I’ve talked to, Democrats, too, admire you for knowing where the line is,” I said. “Where in this moment,” I asked, “is that line?”\n\n“Well,” he said, “I mean, I think that you have to pick and choose your battles. And obviously right now I think this is an adjustment phase that we’re in. We’ve got an administration that’s incredibly aggressive, that’s moving quickly and decisively, and to the Democrats’ displeasure — in their view, too quickly, too decisively — but I think at the end of the day it’s defending the prerogatives of the institution. I mean, I think the Senate, as an institution and the Article I branch of the government, constitutionally has a role to play, and I think it’s important that the leader understand and be willing to defend the institution and preserve its unique role in our democracy …”\n\n“In what ways in the last two months,” I said, “have you as leader defended the prerogatives of the institution?”\n\n“A willingness to adhere to the rules. Everything we’ve done so far with regard to nominees, notwithstanding a lot of pressure to break the rules and do things differently and all kind of recess appointments — there are lots of ideas being thrown around out there — we’ve done it the old-fashioned way, and we have just ground things out, pounded away at getting the job done. And I think there’s always a lot of pressure from — and there was in the first time around, in the first Trump term, to get rid of the filibuster — and we resist that because we understand the unique role that the founders had for the Senate,” Thune said. “There are constantly threats to and efforts to undermine the Senate’s role.”\n\n“Have you,” I said, “said to the president at any point, That’s our job, not yours?”\n\n“I don’t know if I’ve said it exactly that way,” Thune said with a laugh. “It might’ve been a little bit more diplomatic …”\n\n“But you’ve said a version of that, privately, diplomatically?”\n\n“Or when asked by people — whether it’s the president or people around him or people who share some of his views on how we should do things around here — I think,” Thune said, “I’ve been very clear.”\n\nPeople who know him well these days sometimes watch him and worry about the toll this job is taking. The people who raised him are gone. His mother and Abdnor died in 2012. His father died, at 100 years old, in 2020. Coach Jerry Applebee died just this January. Now his older brother. “My prayer for him,” his younger brother Tim told me, “is don’t let Washington corrupt you. You’re John Thune. You’re the kid from Murdo. Stay the kid from Murdo. Don’t let Washington corrupt you.”\n\nHe has to this point as leader of the Senate in this country’s 119th Congress compiled a record of what some see as accomplishment and what others consider accommodation. He toasted Trump at his inauguration. “We’re not looking backwards, we’re looking forward,” he said of the Jan. 6 pardons. “This is not unusual for an administration to pause funding,” he said of the aid freeze. “The president is somebody who sees great value in the use of tariffs as a tool, and we’ll have, I’m sure, lots of conversations,” Thune said of Trump’s tariffs that could have massive consequences for among many others his own farming constituents in South Dakota. He’s “put some ideas out there,” he said of Trump’s musing about taking over Gaza and making it a seaside resort. “Anything that DOGE does will be factored into what we do here,” he said of the activities of Elon Musk. “The American people handed him a decisive mandate,” he said. “It’s important we honor that mandate by confirming his nominees as quickly as possible,” he said. He’s praised Trump’s picks for his Cabinet. “We’re trending in the right direction,” he said. And in the aftermath of the Oval Office blowup between Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, even as some fellow Senate Republicans reacted with great consternation — “I am sick to my stomach as the administration appears to be walking away from our allies and embracing Putin, a threat to democracy and U.S. values,” said Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski — Thune did what he does. “No question in my mind that Russia is the aggressor,” he told South Dakota’s Mitchell Republic. But he didn’t clearly criticize the interaction or Trump’s part, calling the meeting “spirited” and pointing to the future. “Obviously,” he said, “there will have to be some subsequent follow-up meetings that occur, but hopefully they got some of that out of their system …” Thune aides say his relationship with Trump has never been better.\n\n“Talk about the right person being in the right place at the right time,” Scott Howell, the longtime Thune consultant, told me. “The years of his service have culminated in this moment,” Steve Daines, the Montana senator and Thune confidant, told me. “He’s smart enough,” Larry Rhoden, the South Dakota governor, told me, “to get behind Trump, lock, stock and barrel,”\n\nBut Thune’s role, which is to say the role of the Senate, is not exclusively or even primarily to work with the president and enact the agenda of the executive, according to his critics. The Senate, in the words of James Madison, is supposed to “protect the people against the transient impressions in which they themselves might be led.” The Senate, in the words of Mike Mansfield, history’s longest-serving Senate majority leader, is “one of the foundations of the Constitution” — “one of the rocks of the Republic.”\n\nAnd the current majority leader? “You are in an extraordinary position now to curb this presidency and keep it in bounds,” Ken Kemp said this month in his latest open letter to Thune. “I was trying to appeal to the better angels of his nature, because they’re there,” Kemp told me. “I’ve been waiting to see you take your stand,” Kemp wrote. “I’m still waiting and hoping.”\n\n“The next year or two will tell a lot about what matters to him and how much it matters,” longtime Tom Daschle adviser Pete Stavrianos told me. “On one side you have his ambition, and on the other side you have what he believes in about our system, and democracy and the prerogatives of the Senate,” he said. “My guess he’s at least somewhat tortured on the inside.”\n\n“It’s not an overstatement, it really isn’t, to say the fate of our democracy and our country may be determined by a single decision that he makes,” Drey Samuelson, the former Tim Johnson chief of staff, told me.\n\n“It’s a damn shame,” Mark Salter, the longtime John McCain adviser, told me. “God,” he said. “It’s just not worth it. Your time is so finite. It’s so brief. Your life is brief. But your time in public life is briefer. And when you’re gone,” he said, “you’re gone.”\n\nThis week in his office Thune brought up David Brooks without me having to ask. “David Brooks talks about resume virtues and eulogy virtues,” he told me. “I went to my brother’s funeral in California here not long ago,” he said. “I was reminded of the importance of eulogy virtues.”\n\nIn what ways, I wondered, is what he’s doing right now and how he’s doing it “resume” work, and in what ways is it “eulogy” work?\n\n“I think sometimes what you do might be considered resume work,” he said. “I think how you do it is considered more eulogy work.”\n\n“You listened to what people said about your brother,” I said to Thune. “What do you think people will say about you at your service?”\n\n“Well,” he said, “that chapter’s probably still being written.”\n\n“What do you think they will say about this particular moment in time, this role that you’re playing right now?”",

        "full_text": "House Democrats are livid. The progressive grassroots is aghast. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), after taking a victory lap after the first cloture vote on the House GOP’s continuing resolution, which would fund the government for another six months, totally caved yesterday. He’s going to vote to keep the government open. Republicans needed a handful of Democratic votes to get to 60. They didn’t have it on Tuesday. They will soon, with Schumer and now Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) announcing they’d support keeping the government open.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor once, House Democrats are angrier with their own party than Donald Trump. It’s ironic: the liberal media and the Democrats expected GOP disarray and chaos, and this shutdown fight sparked a civil war among themselves. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who Schumer is rumored to be wary of regarding a primary challenge, might have been given the push she needs to plan on that front. But first, she’s mobilizing House Democrats against Mr. Schumer (via CNN):\n\nNew York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Thursday that she plans to mobilize her massive base of followers to oppose what she described as an “acquiesce” by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to accept the House GOP funding bill.\n\n“I think there is a deep sense of outrage and betrayal,” Ocasio-Cortez told reporters in Leesburg, Virginia, where House Democrats are huddling for their annual policy retreat. She said she and her fellow Democrats are “texting, calling, sending carrier pigeons,” to mobilize the Democratic base against Schumer’s plan to allow the GOP funding bill to advance.\n\nAnd she slammed Senate Democrats for their decision to “completely roll over and give up on protecting the Constitution.”\n\nAsked whether Senate Democrats need new leadership, Ocasio-Cortez would say only that she is focused on how to prevent her party from accepting the GOP bill.\n\n“We have time to correct course on this decision. Senate Democrats can vote no. We can correct course, and that is the most important thing in front of us right now,” Ocasio-Cortez said.\n\n[…]\n\nPrivately, House Democrats are so infuriated with Schumer’s decision that some have begun encouraging her to run against Schumer in a primary, according to a Democratic member who directly spoke with Ocasio-Cortez about running at the caucus’ policy retreat. Multiple Democrats in the Congressional Progressive Caucus and others directly encouraged Ocasio-Cortez to run on Thursday night after Schumer’s announcement, this member said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI’m not one to defend Democrats or Schumer—if any of these people were drowning politically, I’d either watch or throw them an anvil—but this is how insane the Democrats have become: voting to keep the government open is now viewed as an attack on the Constitution. Schumer, a longtime liberal Democrat, might have had his donkey card ripped up because he’s voting to prevent a shutdown when there is nothing to gain here for his party, which he knows will likely be blamed for the shutdown if Democrats don’t have a message or plan for when the doors are closed. He bluffed and Trump called him on it. He lost. Period.\n\nThe Democrats lost, which I think is why they’re so incensed on the House side—it’s starting to become clear that they cannot beat this man, and they likely never will. One deviation and you’re cleaved from the herd. That’s how they lost in 2024, and why Democrats are in terrible shape among voters.\n\nThis party is lost, which is not to say the Republicans can’t mess up. But they do have some breathing room. Pass this CR and get the budget reconciliation package done. Let the Democrats squabble on how to make themselves more regional and irrelevant.",

        "full_text": "A coalition of House GOP lawmakers is gearing up to introduce legislation preventing Chinese nationals from obtaining U.S. student visas, according to a new report.\n\nOn Wednesday, Fox News revealed that Rep. Riley Moore, R-W.Va., is preparing to file the Stop Chinese Communist Prying by Vindicating Intellectual Safeguards in Academia Act, or the “Stop CCP VISAs Act,” later this week. The legislation, according to the outlet, is intended to block what the congressman contended is Beijing’s “exploitation” of America’s student visa program to undermine U.S. interests.\n\nA copy of the measure obtained by Fox stipulates that, “An alien who is a national of the People’s Republic of China may not be issued a visa or otherwise provided status as a non-immigrant … for the purpose of conducting research or pursuing a course of study.” GOP Reps. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, Andy Ogles of Tennessee, and Brandon Gill of Texas are among those expected to co-sponsor the bill.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials have warned in recent years how the Chinese Communist Party has used America’s student visa program to further its own goals for regional and global dominance.\n\nIn 2019, for instance, the first Trump administration’s Office of the Director of National Intelligence released its “Worldwide Threat Assessment,” which disclosed that “China’s intelligence services will exploit the openness of American society, especially academia and the scientific community, using a variety of means.”\n\nDespite Beijing’s increasingly antagonistic behavior toward America and its allies, however, the U.S. has continued to grant hundreds of thousands of student visas to Chinese nationals every year.\n\nAs The Blaze’s Daniel Horowitz recently reported, “In the 2023-24 academic year, 123,000 Chinese nationals were enrolled in [U.S.] graduate programs, many in sensitive STEM fields.” An additional 62,000, he noted, “participated in ‘optional practical training,’ allowing them to work in those fields while still on student visas.”\n\n“Beyond student visas, the U.S. grants over 20,000 H-1B visas to Chinese nationals each year, along with more than 12,000 J-1 visas for scholars and tens of thousands of additional work visas,” Horowitz wrote. “Over the past 30 years, the U.S. has issued nearly 2 million green cards to Chinese nationals — more than any country except Mexico — despite clear evidence of China’s long-running campaign of economic and academic subversion.”\n\nSpeaking with Fox, Moore cited an October 2024 FBI indictment involving five Chinese nationals who were charged for allegedly spying on a U.S. military base in Northern Michigan. According to Campus Reform, the five individuals — who had recently graduated from the University of Michigan — were purportedly taking photos of military equipment during an August 2023 training exercise between U.S. National Guard forces and Taiwanese military personnel.\n\n“We’ve literally invited the CCP to spy on our military, steal our intellectual property, and threaten national security,” Moore said. “It’s time we turn off the spigot and immediately ban all student visas going to Chinese nationals.”\n\nShawn Fleetwood is a staff writer for The Federalist and a graduate of the University of Mary Washington.

        "full_text": "The Columbine killers have claimed another victim.\n\nNearly 26 years after two troubled Colorado teenagers barged into Columbine High School and opened fire, killing a dozen classmates and a teacher, one of the students left wounded by their barrage of bullets has died from the injuries she sustained on that April 20, 1999, the Jefferson County Coroner's Office reported.\n\nAnne Marie Hochhalter, 43, died of sepsis on Feb. 16 and the two gunshot wounds that left her paralyzed were a \"significant contributing factor\" in her death, Dr. Dawn B. Holmes, a forensic pathologist, wrote in a 13-page report released March 1.\n\n“The manner of death is best classified as homicide,” Holmes wrote.\n\nWith Hochhalter's passing, the death toll now stands at 14. That total does not include the shooters, Dylan Klebold, 17, and Eric Harris, 18, who killed themselves before police could arrest them.\n\nHochhalter, then a 17-year-old junior, was eating lunch with friends when she was shot in the chest and back, suffering wounds that left her paralyzed from the waist down and in chronic pain for the rest of her life.\n\nSix months later, Hochhalter suffered another loss from which she never completely recovered when her mother, Carla June Hochhalter, who had been struggling with depression, walked into a pawnshop and killed herself with a loaded gun that she had been inspecting.\n\nLeaning on her faith and on friendships forged in the wake of Columbine, Hochhalter devoted her life to supporting other victims of mass shootings.\n\n“She was fiercely independent,” Sue Townsend, stepmother of Columbine shooting victim Lauren Townsend told The Denver Post last month. “She was a fighter. She’d get knocked down — she struggled a lot with health issues that stemmed from the shooting — but I’d watch her pull herself back up. She was her best advocate and an advocate for others who weren’t as strong in the disability community.”\n\nIn 2016, Hochhalter found it in her heart to reach out with forgiveness to Klebold's mother, Sue Klebold, after she published a memoir about raising a mass killer called \"A Mother's Reckoning.\"\n\n“Just as I wouldn’t want to be judged by the sins of my family members, I hold you in that same regard,” Hochhalter wrote. “It’s been a rough road for me, with many medical issues because of my spinal cord injury and intense nerve pain, but I choose not to be bitter towards you.\"\n\nThe mass killing at Columbine put a previously obscure Denver suburb called Littleton on the nation's radar, and images of heavily armed SWAT teams descending on the school and the sight of students filing out with their hands up were burned into the national consciousness.\n\n“Columbine played out on TV,” Bruce Beck, who was Lauren Townsend's stepfather, told NBC News in 2019 on the 20th anniversary of the massacre. “No previous school shooting had done that. There was the unknown of where the shooters were during the entire time that it was being filmed, so I think people connected with Columbine more.”\n\nThe others killed at Columbine that day were teacher William \"Dave\" Sanders, 47, and students Cassie Bernall, 17, Steve Curnow, 14, Corey DePooter, 17, Kelly Fleming, 16, Matt Kechter, 16, Daniel Mauser, 15, Daniel Rohrbough, 15, Rachel Scott, 17, Isaiah Shoels, 18, John Tomlin, 16, and Kyle Velasquez, 16.\n\nSadly, the Columbine massacre also set a tragic template for the school shootings that followed.",

The state’s general fund is covering $8.4 billion.\n\nStarting January 1, 2024, California began offering medical coverage to all undocumented immigrants in the state through Medi-Cal, the state’s version of Medicaid, the federal program that covers low-income individuals.\n\nA spokesperson for Gov. Gavin Newsom, D, said of the shortfall “This isn’t new. Rising Medicaid costs are a national challenge, affecting both red and blue states alike. This is not unique to California.”\n\nDuring a budget hearing in February, State Rep. Carl DeMaio, R, said cutting the program would lead to a $1 billion surplus and allow the state to have a reserve.\n\nDeMaio: “My colleague from Los Angeles mentions a moral budget, a morally balanced budget. I’d like to start with a balanced budget.”\n\nAccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 14 states plus DC offer state-funded health care to all children regardless of immigration status, seven of those states and DC also offer coverage to some or all adults.",

        "full_text": "Last week, Blaze News and \"Glenn TV\" exposed a National Aeronautics and Space Administration playbook created to market its Artemis program, a series of missions paving the way to Mars and beyond.\n\nArtemis, which kicked off under the first Trump administration, initially aimed to \"land the first woman and next man\" on the moon. Under the Biden administration, the mission was updated, with NASA vowing to \"land the first woman and first person of color on the Moon.\"\n\n'Let science lead the way.'\n\nA 2021 99-slide deck, \"The Artemis Brand Playbook,\" obtained by Blaze News through whistleblowers, outlined a comprehensive, high-budget marketing strategy for the mission, covering branding, messaging, target audiences, potential challenges, and proposed corporate partnerships.\n\nThe leaked document, detailing storylines for NASA's mission with listed \"antagonists\" and \"protagonists,\" revealed the deep integration of diversity, equity, and inclusion goals under the Biden administration.\n\nTwo NASA whistleblowers, who asked to remain anonymous due to fear of retaliation, previously spoke to Blaze News about the Artemis playbook and the infiltration of DEI at NASA.\n\n\"I was just pretty shocked at how meticulous they were in controlling the narrative and already pre-identifying protagonists, antagonists,\" one of the scientists stated.\n\nShe highlighted the playbook's suggested storylines for the Artemis project, explaining how NASA had \"cherry-pick[ed] these rags-to-riches stories ... a lot of it was centered around DEI.\"\n\nThe second scientist noted the \"production value\" of the extensive slide deck.\n\n\"There's probably millions of dollars attached to this document,\" he told Blaze News.\n\n\"NASA, in my opinion, has become a glorified DEI program,\" he remarked.\n\nA NASA spokesperson confirmed the playbook's authenticity, telling Blaze News that it was \"developed in 2021 by a third party, which had limited use at the agency and reflected the priorities of the previous administration.\"\n\nOn day one of President Donald Trump's second administration, he signed an executive action directing the federal government to purge all DEI-related initiatives. However, NASA did not appear to have updated its website to comply with the order.\n\nFor example, a webpage about the Artemis program noted that the agency still aimed to \"land the first woman, first person of color, and first international partner astronaut on the Moon using innovative technologies to explore more of the lunar surface than ever before.\"\n\nLast week, \"Glenn TV\" contacted the Office of Management and Budget to inquire about NASA's apparent lack of compliance with the Trump administration's requirements.\n\n\"The language from the website has been changed,\" an OMB spokesperson responded. \"Other changes should be end of day.\"\n\nBlaze News confirmed that the language was removed from the webpage.\n\nA learning resources page, titled \"What Is the Artemis Program? (Grades 5-8),\" was also flagged by \"Glenn TV.\" The Trump administration's OMB stated that it plans to update this webpage as well, which as of Wednesday morning still described the mission as \"sending the first woman and first person of color on the Moon.\"\n\nThe whistleblowers shared their reactions to the updates in a statement to Blaze News.\n\nNASA's swift response is a step in the right direction, but the true measure of progress will be whether it leads to real, lasting change. Time and again, we have seen how public messaging diverges from internal reality — leadership makes inspiring commitments in speeches, only for them to be diluted in execution.\n\nThe issue at NASA runs far deeper than just the playbook. DEI sits atop a long list of budgetary burdens that have historically come at the expense of other critical priorities, including the very scientists who drive NASA's missions forward.\n\nScientific achievement should speak for itself — it does not need bureaucracy or public relations teams to temper its message in the name of a politicized agenda. The groundbreaking work of NASA's scientists, engineers, and astronauts is already challenging enough, yet it is too often burdened by unnecessary delays and funding withdrawals. If their work is deemed essential, they must be given the resources and agency to carry it out without interference.\n\nAnything less — especially any reprioritization that shifts focus to DEI at the expense of critical research — is a slap in the face to those scientific efforts.\n\nThe real question is whether this administration will prioritize the people who make space exploration possible. True progress comes from discovery, not from reshuffling priorities to satisfy political narratives.\n\nLet science lead the way. Let the scientists, engineers, and astronauts speak for themselves, let them shape their own stories of success, and let them do so free from unnecessary obstacles and agendas.",

        "full_text": "LOADINGERROR LOADING\n\nThe temporary leader of the Social Security Administration should resign for “outrageous” political retaliation against the state of Maine, Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) said Wednesday.\n\nEarlier this month, the Social Security Administration canceled contracts with Maine’s health department that had allowed parents to request Social Security numbers for newborns at the hospital, which is how 99% of newborns get their numbers in the U.S.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe contracts were quickly reinstated amid suspicion they’d been terminated as payback for Maine Gov. Janet Mills (D) standing up to President Donald Trump in a White House meeting in February.\n\nThis week, Leland Dudek, the acting commissioner of Social Security, acknowledged he was “upset” with Mills for defying the president.\n\n“We’ve now learned that the acting head of the SSA did, in fact, punish our state for daring to question the President. This is absolutely outrageous,” Pingree said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I believe Secretary Dudek should resign immediately ― or be removed from his position,” Pingree said. “The SSA is simply too important, and affects the lives of too many people, for it to be led by someone who is willing to throw an entire state into turmoil, all because its Governor refused to be intimidated by the actions of a President who is acting illegally.”\n\nThe Social Security Administration and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDudek told HuffPost during a press call on Tuesday evening that he canceled the contracts by mistake because he didn’t understand them, but also that he didn’t like how Mills behaved in the February meeting when she told Trump she would “see you in court” over his efforts to force states to disallow transgender athletes from participating in girls’ sports.\n\n“I think when you bring people together to have a cordial exchange, to show governments working together, you need to be respectful of each other,” Dudek said.\n\nDudek denied it was political retaliation, but offered no other reason for the contract cancellations, which also affected electronic death records. Every state has similar contracts; no other state saw theirs canceled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSen. Angus King (I-Maine) previously said the episode “left many unanswered questions about the Social Security Administration’s motivations,” but neither he nor other members of the Maine congressional delegation responded to requests for comment on Wednesday. Nor did the Republican chairs of the House and Senate committees that oversee Social Security.\n\nRep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement that Dudek “admitted to canceling contracts out of pettiness” and is running Social Security into the ground at the direction of Trump and Elon Musk, the senior White House adviser in charge of downsizing federal agencies.\n\nTrump tapped Dudek for acting commissioner last month after his predecessor in the role refused to grant Musk’s team access to sensitive Social Security databases. The Senate Finance Committee is set to hold a hearing with Frank Bisignano, the man Trump picked to succeed Dudek, next week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDudek has drawn up plans for layoffs, consolidated internal bureaucracies and announced changes to customer service that will require more seniors to visit Social Security offices in person.\n\n“I’ve had to make some tough choices, choices I didn’t agree with, but the president wanted it and I did it,” Dudek said in a closed-door meeting earlier this month, according to a recording obtained by ProPublica. It’s not clear what choices Dudek had in mind but it’s possible he was talking about Maine’s “enumeration at birth” and “electronic death records” contracts.\n\nGo Ad-Free — And Protect The Free Press\n\nThe next four years will change America forever.

        "full_text": "Democrats are relying on a recent memo from the Government Accountability Office to argue that President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans can't pass a bill repealing a Biden-era waiver allowing California to mandate electric vehicles in the state. But legal experts say the memo—whose authors include a prominent DEI activist—isn't legally binding and relies on dubious reasoning.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office—which conducts audits and analyses for Congress but has minimal legislative authority—published the memo earlier this month just two weeks after Democratic senators Adam Schiff (Calif.), Alex Padilla (Calif.), and Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.) asked it to investigate the issue. Media outlets then reported that the memo determined a bill to reverse the Biden-era action is \"illegal\" and that the office, therefore, \"blocks\" such a bill.\n\nThe office's memo presents a potential roadblock to Trump's energy agenda, a key tenet of which involves revoking electric vehicle mandates. Democrats, who cheered the opinion immediately after it was published, may request that the Senate parliamentarian weigh in on the issue and consult the Government Accountability Office's opinion.\n\nIf Democrats are successful in using the opinion to block the bill, the California electric vehicle mandate can only be overturned through a formal Environmental Protection Agency rulemaking process that would take years to complete and likely attract legal challenges.\n\nBut experts say there are key legal deficiencies in the Government Accountability Office's opinion. \"It's just sloppy work,\" Michael Buschbacher, a former counsel at the Department of Justice's Environment and Natural Resources Division, told the Washington Free Beacon. \"I think the goal of what they were doing was to insert themselves in this process.\"\n\nAnd the quick turnaround on the document raises questions about the level of involvement from the Democratic lawmakers who requested the opinion—the office usually takes months to complete analyses, not a couple of weeks.\n\nNotably, one of the coauthors of the Government Accountability Office's memo is Shirley Jones, the office's managing associate general counsel. Jones is an outspoken DEI activist who recently served as the president of the advocacy group Blacks in Government, once applauded former president Joe Biden's executive order on DEI in the federal workforce, and said in a 2021 interview that women who work in the government face \"microaggressions\" and are often subjected to \"mansplaining.\"\n\nIn December, in one of its final actions during the Biden administration, the Environmental Protection Agency granted California a waiver under the 1970 Clean Air Act that allows it to issue vehicle emissions regulations that are stricter than federal emissions standards, an action that green-lit the state's electric vehicle mandate that will kick in later this year. The waiver allows other states to adopt California's rules, something 12 states have opted to do.\n\nAccording to the Government Accountability Office's memo authored by Jones, the Biden administration's action is not subject to a Congressional Review Act resolution because it is a waiver, not a rule or regulation. The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to pass resolutions via a simple majority floor vote to reverse actions finalized by federal agencies.\n\nA successful Congressional Review Act resolution would immediately overturn the Biden-era waiver and California mandate, meaning the Trump EPA wouldn't have to overturn it through a formal rulemaking process, which could take years and attract legal challenges.\n\nSuch a resolution is the Trump administration's preferred course of action—in February, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin submitted the waiver to Congress for review. One month earlier, Rep. John Joyce (R., Pa.) introduced the Preserving Choice in Vehicle Purchases Act, a Congressional Review Act resolution that would overturn the waiver and is poised to receive a floor vote in the near future.\n\nBuschbacher, the former Justice Department official, noted that the Government Accountability Office's opinion fails even to acknowledge Section 177 of the Clean Air Act, the provision that allows other states to adopt California's standards. That, according to Buschbacher, makes an EPA waiver a \"rule of general applicability\" since it has far-reaching nationwide impacts, a bar that it must clear to be considered a \"rule\" under the Congressional Review Act.\n\nBuschbacher and Jimmy Conde, who are both partners at the law firm Boyden Gray, wrote a paper this month that argued in favor of Congress's authority to use the Congressional Review Act to overturn EPA waivers. The paper states that the Government Accountability Office, an unelected part of the federal bureaucracy, does not have the authority to restrict Congress from making law, that it is longstanding precedent that all actions an agency submits to Congress are treated as rules, and that EPA waivers have nationwide impacts.\n\n\"What GAO has previously said is that submission of a rule or an action to Congress—any action to Congress, even when the agency thinks it's not a rule and submits it only out of an abundance of caution—gets treated as a rule,\" Buschbacher said in reference to the Government Accountability Office's past opinions.\n\nUltimately, Buschbacher said the memo should have little impact on Congress's ability to pass a bill overturning the waiver green-lighting California's mandate—\"it's like they wrote an op-ed basically,\" he told the Free Beacon.\n\nThe Senate parliamentarian has no formal role in the process but has historically advised Congress based on the Government Accountability Office's opinions. Since the EPA hasn't overturned its prior positions, that should not pose an obstacle, Buschbacher said. If the parliamentarian were to conclude otherwise, however, \"that would essentially change the rules in the middle of the game and put things into uncharted territory.\"\n\n\"The plain text of the [Congressional Review Act] is very clear that once an agency action is submitted to Congress for review, Congress has the unreviewable power to consider and, if desired, disapprove of that action,\" said Kenny Stein, the vice president of policy at the American Energy Alliance. \"There is no provision in the [Congressional Review Act] that GAO must first signal approval prior to Congress acting under the [Congressional Review Act].\"\n\nMike McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist who worked in the White House during the first Trump administration, said he gave the Government Accountability Office an \"A-minus for creativity. D for execution.\"\n\n\"It's like they're trying to confirm the idea that the deep state is a legit threat,\" he told the Free Beacon.\n\n\"You have clear agreement between the executive branch and legislative branch,\" an energy industry source told the Free Beacon. \"That's sort of the deep state, the blatantly political angle that you have here. Three Democratic senators said, 'Hey, GAO, what do you think, even though you don't have a role to play?' And lo and behold, they miraculously had a pre-baked 10-page memo.\"",

        "full_text": "U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent foreign-policy moves have alienated the country’s traditional allies in Europe while stirring glee in Moscow. While it’s a catastrophic development for Ukrainian security and democracy, this paradigmatic shift portends much larger risks for global security. The most pressing is the threat of rampant nuclear proliferation that the Trump administration’s actions will elicit.\n\nWhile on the surface it might seem as though a warmer relationship between two of the world’s largest nuclear powers could reduce the risk of nuclear war, the opposite is true. We are on the precipice of a global turn toward nuclear instability, in which many countries will be newly incentivized to build their own arsenals, increasing the risk of nuclear use, terrorist subversion, and accidental launch. Countries like South Korea, Japan, Iran, and Saudi Arabia are all so-called nuclear latent states that could potentially build nuclear weapons quickly—as are Germany, Belgium, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands.\n\nFor the last eight decades, the United States has served as a security guarantor to many countries in both Europe and Asia. Trump insists that Washington has received the short end of the stick from these arrangements, since it was the U.S. nuclear arsenal that served as the ultimate deterrent in defense of the United States’ allies. The massive upside of U.S. security guarantees, however, including for Americans, has been the astonishing containment of nuclear proliferation elsewhere.\n\nOnly nine countries around the world have nuclear weapons today: the United States, Russia, United Kingdom, France, China, Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea. (South Africa gave up its nuclear weapons and then signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1991.) Today, 190 countries are parties to the treaty, which went into effect in 1970. The only non-signatory states are India, Israel, Pakistan, and South Sudan. (North Korea withdrew from the treaty in 2003 to pursue its nuclear weapons program.)\n\nMany countries signed the NPT because of U.S. assurances about their security—what is commonly known as the nuclear umbrella. These countries include NATO members in Europe (such as Germany, Italy, and Belgium), along with other U.S. allies like Japan and South Korea. When Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus inherited a large number of nuclear weapons and delivery systems in the early 1990s after the Soviet Union collapsed, U.S. security assurances helped convince them to give up their nuclear weapons.\n\nThe confinement of this deadly technology to relatively few countries has been a massive boon to global security and allowed for much greater prosperity. Without U.S. security assurances, the world might have been far more insecure, with several additional nuclear weapons states across Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Nuclear safety and inadvertent escalation concerns about the possession of nuclear weapons mean that we might even have seen potential nuclear use—deliberate or accidental—which would have had catastrophic consequences.\n\nU.S. security guarantees, long perceived as highly credible, have been a pillar of the global nonproliferation regime that has reduced the likelihood of nuclear war and nuclear accidents, and allowed countries to devote resources to other purposes—including economic prosperity.\n\nThe credibility of the U.S. nuclear umbrella has now been shattered by Trump. Why would NATO allies in Europe—recent targets of intense criticism by the Trump administration—believe that the United States would stand by them in the case of a nuclear threat from Russia?\n\nAmong U.S. allies threatened by China or North Korea’s nuclear weapons, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea are undoubtedly asking themselves this same question. The broader concern here is that even if just one of these European or East Asian allies decides to secure themselves by building their own nuclear weapons, there might be a domino effect leading to several more nuclear states. This would sound the death knell of the nuclear nonproliferation regime.\n\nThere may be higher risks of nuclear proliferation in Asia than in Europe because both France and the U.K. have nuclear arsenals that could provide extended deterrence to NATO. Even in Europe, however, political conditions are concerning. The parties garnering the second-most popular support today in France, Germany, and Poland are all right-wing nationalists. Marine Le Pen, who could potentially become the next French president, recently said that France should not share the country’s nuclear weapons, “let alone delegate” their use to other European countries.\n\nThere have also been calls for Germany to recommit to civilian nuclear research, with the aim of developing its ability to build nuclear weapons. Poland is also considering its nuclear options. The stability of the erstwhile European security architecture that used to be upheld by the promise of U.S. nuclear assurances is now rapidly fraying and giving way to a path of nuclear proliferation on the continent.\n\nSome scholars have argued that more nuclear weapons around the world would actually enhance security. They cite the absence of nuclear use between the United States and Soviet Union over the course of the Cold War, inferring that because the consequences of nuclear use are so dire, states are almost never willing to take that risk.\n\nAccording to this reasoning, we don’t need to fear nuclear proliferation because that will not necessarily increase the risk of use. This school of thought argues further that nuclear proliferation could even reduce the incidence of conventional war since the dangers of nuclear escalation would always lurk in the background.\n\nUnwittingly encouraging widespread nuclear proliferation is a highly reckless move, however. The introduction of nuclear programs is known to create fear, distrust, and competition—even among allies. France’s development of nuclear weapons in 1960 led to an acrimonious relationship with the United States that prompted Paris to withdraw from NATO’s integrated military command in 1966. China’s development of nuclear weapons in 1964 also hastened its split from the Soviet Union in the 1960s, eventually leading to a nuclear crisis by the end of the decade.\n\nSecurity dilemmas would replace alliances. The risks of accidental launch exponentially increase if more countries possess nuclear weapons. Not every state has the resources to maintain safe and secure nuclear arsenals, raising huge concerns about command, control, and vulnerability to terrorist sabotage or theft. For example, in Pakistan, terrorists have attacked a nuclear missile storage facility, a nuclear airbase, and one of the country’s main nuclear weapon assembly sites.\n\nAlthough countries that perceive themselves as thoroughly ensconced within the U.S.-led security order might be the first to proliferate, they most certainly would not be the last. A range of regimes would be tempted to secure their futures with nuclear weapons, and the end result would be that everyone is significantly less secure.\n\nIt is well past time for the Trump administration to think strategically about U.S. interests, as well as of those around the world who have long benefited from the relative stability of U.S. security guarantees. If the United States continues to sow serious doubt about the credibility of its security commitments, however, regional organizations in Europe and the Indo-Pacific must step into the breach to create sustainable multilateral security frameworks. It is also important for potential proliferator states to consider that acquiring nuclear weapons may not make them any safer.\n\nEven beyond the potential nuclear accidents and inadvertent escalation concerns, possessing nuclear weapons does not necessarily lead to a more stable or peaceful security environment. The experience of India and Pakistan demonstrates that conventional wars, military action, and sub-conventional attacks can still take place between nuclear-armed neighbors. This would be true of a nuclear Poland against Russia and a nuclear South Korea against North Korea, for example.\n\nThe Trump administration’s actions have stoked great insecurity across the globe. As a result, the world is a much more dangerous place than it was just a few weeks ago.",

        "full_text": "SEATTLE (AP) — Cybertrucks set ablaze. Bullets and Molotov cocktails aimed at Tesla showrooms.\n\nAttacks on property carrying the logo of Elon Musk’s electric-car company are cropping up across the U.S. and overseas. While no injuries have been reported, Tesla showrooms, vehicle lots, charging stations and privately owned cars have been targeted.\n\nThere’s been a clear uptick since President Donald Trump took office and empowered Musk to oversee a new Department of Government Efficiency that’s slashing government spending. Experts on domestic extremism say it’s impossible to know yet if the spate of incidents will balloon into a long-term pattern.\n\nIn Trump’s first term, his properties in New York, Washington and elsewhere became a natural place for protest. In the early days of his second term, Tesla is filling that role.\n\n“Tesla is an easy target,” said Randy Blazak, a sociologist who studies political violence. “They’re rolling down our streets. They have dealerships in our neighborhoods.”\n\nMusk critics have organized dozens of peaceful demonstrations at Tesla dealerships and factories across North America and Europe. Some Tesla owners, including a U.S. senator who feuded with Musk, have vowed to sell their vehicles.\n\nBut the attacks are keeping law enforcement busy.\n\nProsecutors in Colorado charged a woman last month in connection with attacks on Tesla dealerships, including Molotov cocktails thrown at vehicles and the words “Nazi cars” spray-painted on a building.\n\nAnd federal agents in South Carolina last week arrested a man they say set fire to Tesla charging stations near Charleston. An agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives wrote in an affidavit that authorities found writings critical of the government and DOGE in his bedroom and wallet.\n\n“The statement made mention of sending a message based on these beliefs,” the agent wrote.\n\nSome of the most prominent incidents have been reported in left-leaning cities in the Pacific Northwest, like Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, where anti-Trump and anti-Musk sentiment runs high.\n\nAn Oregon man faces charges after allegedly throwing several Molotov cocktails at a Tesla store in Salem, then returning another day and shooting out windows. In the Portland suburb of Tigard, more than a dozen bullets were fired at a Tesla showroom last week, damaging vehicles and windows, the second time in a week that the store was targeted.\n\nFour Cybertrucks were set on fire in a Tesla lot in Seattle earlier this month. On Friday, witnesses reported a man poured gasoline on an unoccupied Tesla Model S and started a fire on a Seattle street.\n\nIn Las Vegas, several Tesla vehicles were set ablaze early Tuesday outside a Tesla service center where the word “resist” was also painted in red across the building’s front doors. Authorities said at least one person threw Molotov cocktails — crude bombs filled with gasoline or another flammable liquid — and fired several rounds from a weapon into the vehicles.\n\n“Was this terrorism? Was it something else? It certainly has some of the hallmarks that we might think — the writing on the wall, potential political agenda, an act of violence,” Spencer Evans, the special agent in charge of the Las Vegas FBI office, said at a news conference. “None of those factors are lost on us.”\n\nTesla becomes a target for the left\n\nTesla was once the darling of the left. Helped to viability by a $465 million federal loan during the Obama administration, the company popularized electric vehicles and proved, despite their early reputation, that they didn’t have to be small, stodgy, underpowered and limited in range.\n\nMore recently, though, Musk has allied himself with the right. He bought the social network Twitter, renamed it X and erased restrictions that had infuriated conservatives. He spent an estimated $250 million to boost Trump’s 2024 Republican campaign, becoming by far his biggest benefactor.\n\nMusk continues to run Tesla — as well as X and the rocket manufacturer SpaceX — while also serving as Trump’s adviser.\n\nTesla stock doubled in value in the weeks after Trump’s election but has since shed all those gains.\n\nTrump gave a boost to the company when he turned the White House driveway into an electric-vehicle showroom. He promoted the vehicles and said he would purchase an $80,000 Model S, eschewing his fierce past criticism of electric vehicles.\n\nTesla didn’t respond to a request for comment. Musk briefly addressed the vandalism Monday during an appearance on Sen. Ted Cruz’s podcast, saying “at least some of it is organized and paid for” by “left-wing organizations in America, funded by left-wing billionaires, essentially.”\n\n“This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,” Musk wrote Tuesday on X, sharing a video of burning Teslas in Las Vegas. “Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.”\n\nThe progressive group Indivisible, which published a guide for supporters to organize “Musk Or Us” protests around the country, said in a statement that all of its guidance is publicly available and “it explicitly encourages peaceful protest and condemns any acts of violence or vandalism.”\n\nSome Tesla owners have resorted to cheeky bumper stickers to distance themselves from their vehicle’s new stigma and perhaps deter would-be vandals. They say things like “I bought this before we knew Elon was crazy” or “I just wanted an electric car. Sorry guys.”\n\nPrices for used Cybertrucks, Tesla’s most distinctive product, have dropped nearly 8% since Trump took office, according to CarGurus, which aggregates used-car vehicle listings. The market as a whole remained steady over the period.\n\nThe White House vows a crackdown\n\nThe White House has thrown its weight behind Musk, the highest-profile member of Trump’s administration and a key donor to committees promoting Trump’s political interests. Trump has said Tesla vandalism amounts to “domestic terror,” and Trump has threatened retribution, warning that those who target the company are “going to go through hell.”\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi said she’d opened an investigation “to see how is this being funded, who is behind this.”\n\n“If you’re going to touch a Tesla, go to a dealership, do anything, you better watch out because we’re coming after you,” Bondi said Friday on Fox Business Network. In a statement Tuesday, she vowed to “continue investigations that impose severe consequences,” including for “those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes.”\n\nColin Clarke, a senior research fellow at the Soufan Center, said left-wing political violence tends to target property rather than people. He views the rise of neo-Nazi groups as a bigger security threat at this point.\n\n“It’s not the type of act that I would prioritize,” Clarke said. “Not right now compared to all the other threats that are out there.”\n\nTheresa Ramsdell is the president of the Tesla Owners of Washington state, a club for Tesla enthusiasts, and she and her husband own three of them.\n\n“Hate on Elon and Trump all you want — that’s fine and dandy, it’s your choice,” she said. “It doesn’t justify ruining somebody’s property, vandalizing it, destroying it, setting it on fire. There’s other ways to get your voice heard that’s more effective.”\n\nSomeone recently slapped a “no Elon” sticker on the tailgate of her Cybertruck, but she said she doesn’t intend to stop driving her Teslas. Other club members have taken a similar view, she said.\n\n“I love my car. It’s the safest car,” Ramsdell said. “I’m not going to let somebody else judge me for the car I drive.”\n\n___\n\nCooper reported from Phoenix.",

        "full_text": "The US is expelling South Africa's ambassador to Washington, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio describing him as a \"race-baiting politician\".\n\nIn a post on X, Rubio accused Ebrahim Rasool of hating the US and President Donald Trump, and said the ambassador was \"no longer welcome in our great country\".\n\nThe office for South Africa's president on Saturday called the decision \"regrettable\", adding that the country remained committed to building a mutually beneficial relationship with the US.\n\nThe rare move by the US marks the latest development in rising tensions between the two countries.\n\nWhile lower-ranking diplomats are sometimes expelled, it's highly unusual in the US for it to happen to a more senior official.\n\nIn his post on Friday, Rubio linked to an article from the right-wing outlet Breitbart that quoted some of Rasool's recent remarks made during an online lecture about the Trump administration.\n\nAt the event, Rasool said Trump was \"mobilising a supremacism\" and trying to \"project white victimhood as a dog whistle\" as the white population faced becoming a minority in the US.\n\n\"We see it in the domestic politics of the USA, the Maga movement as a response not simply to a supremacist instinct, but to very clear data that shows great demographic shifts in the USA in which the voting electorate in the USA is projected to become 48% white,\" he said.\n\nHe suggested that South Africa was under attack because \"we are the historical antidote to supremacism\".\n\nIn response, Rubio called Rasool \"PERSONA NON GRATA\", referencing the Latin phrase for \"unwelcome person\".\n\nTies between the US and South Africa have been deteriorating since Trump took office.\n\nAn executive order last month - which froze US assistance to South Africa - cited \"unjust racial discrimination\" against white Afrikaners, largely descended from Dutch settlers who first arrived in the 17th Century.\n\nIt references a new law, the Expropriation Act, that it claims targets Afrikaners by allowing the government to take away private land.\n\n\"As long as South Africa continues to support bad actors on the world stage and allows violent attacks on innocent disfavoured minority farmers, the United States will stop aid and assistance to the country,\" a statement from the White House said at the time.\n\nSouth Africa's 2022 census noted that white people - including Afrikaners - made up 7.2% of the population. However, according to a 2018 land audit by the South African government, white farmers owned 72% of the country's individually-held farmland.\n\nSouth Africa's government, which is made up of 10 parties led by the African National Congress (ANC), said earlier that the US president's actions were based on \"a campaign of misinformation and propaganda aimed at misrepresenting our great nation\".\n\nIt added no land had been seized without compensation and said this would only happen in exceptional circumstances, such as if land was needed for public use and all other avenues to acquire the land had been exhausted.\n\nA fact sheet from the White House states the country \"blatantly discriminates against ethnic minority descendants of settler groups\".\n\nRasool - who previously served as US ambassador from 2010 to 2015 - was himself forcibly removed from his home in Cape Town's District Six as a child after it was declared a white area under the Apartheid government.\n\nHe would later describe the eviction as a significant moment in his upbringing which guided his future.\n\nRasool became Pretoria's ambassador to the US again in 2024.\n\nUnnamed sources in the South African government told online news site Daily Maverick at the time that he was thought to be well placed to deal with a Trump administration because of the experience and contacts he had acquired during his first stint as ambassador.",

        "full_text": "A French politician has called on the US to give the Statue of Liberty back after suggesting that some Americans “have chosen to switch to the side of the tyrants.”\n\nRaphael Glucksmann, a member of the European Parliament who represents the small left-wing party Place Publique, made the comments at a rally on Sunday.\n\n“Give us back the Statue of Liberty,” said Glucksmann. “It was our gift to you. But apparently you despise her.”\n\nThe statue was a gift of friendship to America from France. Inaugurated in 1886, it represents Libertas, the Roman liberty goddess, bearing a torch in her right hand and a tablet in her left hand with the date of the US Declaration of Independence.\n\nBroken shackles lie underneath the statue’s drapery, to symbolize the end of all types of servitude and oppression.\n\nOn Monday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt fired back at Glucksmann.\n\n“My advice to that unnamed low-level French politician would be to remind them that it’s only because of the United States of America that the French are not speaking German right now, so they should be very grateful to our great country,” she said.\n\nGlucksmann then responded in a series of posts on X and Instagram.\n\nHe emphasized that his gratitude to the US “heroes” that fought against the Nazis in WWII is “eternal,” before making a contrast with US President Donald Trump’s recent attempts to negotiate a settlement between Russia and Ukraine, as well as Trump’s public spat with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n“The America of these heroes fought against tyrants, it did not flatter them. It was the enemy of fascism, not the friend of Putin. It helped the resistance and didn’t attack Zelensky,” he wrote.\n\n“It is precisely because I am petrified by Trumps (sic) betrayal that I said yesterday in a rally that we could symbolically take back the Statue of Liberty if your government despised everything it symbolizes in your eyes, ours, and those of the world,” said Glucksmann.\n\n“No one, of course, will come and steal the Statue of Liberty. The statue is yours. But what it embodies belongs to everyone,” he said.\n\n“And if the free world no longer interests your government, then we will take up the torch, here in Europe.”\n\nGlucksmann is co-president of the Place Publique party, which currently holds three seats in the European Parliament, as well as one in the French parliament and another in the country’s senate.\n\nDespite his party’s small size, Glucksmann has received an increasing amount of attention in the French media, including an in-depth interview in political magazine Le Nouvel Obs published March 5, in which he underlined the importance that European powers step up their defense spending amid a reorienting of US policy priorities.\n\nIt has also been rumored that Glucksmann is planning to run for president in elections scheduled for early 2027.",

Both Bedoya and Slaughter called their firings “illegal” and vowed to challenge Trump in court.\n\n“The president just illegally fired me.

Mark Meador, who was nominated by Trump to be the third Republican FTC commissioner, has yet to be confirmed by a full Senate vote.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear if Trump plans to nominate replacements for Bedoya and Slaughter.\n\nWhite House assistant press secretary Taylor Rogers said Trump “has the lawful authority to manage personnel within the executive branch.”\n\n“President Trump will continue to rid the federal government of bad actors unaligned with his common sense agenda the American people decisively voted for,” Rogers added in a statement.\n\nFerguson, who has referred to the agency as the “Trump-Vance FTC” since taking over as chair, backed the president’s right to fire commissioners.\n\n“I have no doubts about his constitutional authority to remove commissioners, which is necessary to ensure democratic accountability for our government,” Ferguson said in a statement posted on X.\n\n“The Federal Trade Commission will continue its tireless work to protect consumers, lower prices, and police anticompetitive behavior,” Ferguson added.\n\nA White House official informed Bedoya and Slaughter that the president has “unrestricted power” to remove executive-branch officers who were confirmed by the Senate, according to an email obtained by the Wall Street Journal.\n\n“Your continued service on the FTC is inconsistent with my administration’s priorities,” the email said. “Accordingly, I am removing you from office pursuant to my authority under Article II of the Constitution.”\n\nEarlier this week, Ferguson confirmed that the FTC was fully prepared to challenge Meta in an April trial that is seeking a breakup of the tech giant. The agency also has pending cases against Amazon and oversees data privacy settlements related to Meta and X.\n\nTrump has sought to exert greater control over independent agencies, issuing an executive order in February that gave the White House more latitude.\n\nThe firings will test a 1935 decision by the Supreme Court in the case Humphrey’s Executor v. United States.\n\nAt the time, the court ruled that the president doesn’t have the authority to fire FTC commissioners without good cause — setting a precedent that has traditionally shielded independent bodies like the FTC and the Federal Reserve from direct executive intervention.\n\nThe White House argues that the FTC has significant executive power and that exemptions offered by Humphrey’s Executor should not apply to its commissioners.\n\nThe FTC firings have “major implications for the independence of the Fed,” one former FTC official told The Post.\n\nTrump has been sharply critical of Fed Chair Jerome Powell in the past due to disagreements over his handling of interest rates. Powell will notably announce the Fed’s next policy move this afternoon.\n\n“I think it was timed as a threat,” the FTC official said.\n\nThe firings along partisan lines could backfire on Republicans in the future under a Democratic White House administration, the official added.\n\n“Are we all going to be happy with Queen Lina Khan at the FTC?” the official said.\n\nKhan, who led the agency under former President Joe Biden and irritated business leaders with a hardnosed approach to enforcement, also ripped the firings.\n\n“The @FTC must enforce the law without fear or favor,” Khan said. “The administration’s illegal attempt to fire Commissioners Slaughter & Bedoya is a disturbing sign that this FTC won’t. It’s a gift to corporate lawbreakers that squeeze American consumers, workers, and honest businesses.”",

        "full_text": "In the wake of the crises of the decade so far — the pandemic, extreme weather and natural disasters, among others — Americans have increasingly expressed their doubts about institutions, the government especially.\n\nSince Donald Trump’s return to office and the rise of Elon Musk as a major political figure, there’s been intense focus on a simple set of questions: What should the government be for? Who should it help? What explains its failures? In Opinion’s latest focus group, we spoke with 14 people from North Carolina who were either directly affected last year by Hurricane Helene, or who had close friends or family members who were. Because of that event, many of them were directly confronted with these questions of government help and trust in institutions. At a time when the future of many government services could change significantly, we asked them about what Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk are doing and how other leaders, like Joe Biden, handled the crisis.\n\n“The whole system of fixing things is broken. Everything that’s supposed to be in place is not there,” one participant said, describing his worries about not only North Carolina but also places devastated by wildfires in recent years. Some worried about FEMA’s future, even if they were deeply dissatisfied with the recovery efforts last year, others wanted to rethink it entirely, and others expressed frustration with the lack of understanding in this hyperpoliticized environment and the false claims that circulated last fall.\n\nAnd at a time when people — including participants in this group — expressed real concern and worry about government cuts, layoffs and funding changes, many also expressed a skeptical and dissatisfied view of how government performs today. What does government do well? One participant answered, “Provide complicated explanations for why it does what it does.”\n\nI want to start off with a really big question: What is government for?\n\nGovernment has a lot of functions. It’s making sure that we have a functioning society and not chaos. It’s the military. It’s public services and programs like Social Security and Medicaid. It’s helping its citizens.\n\nMaintaining order, security, protecting our rights, having some sort of rules and structure around everything — that’s my immediate thought when I think about what the government is supposed to do.\n\nYeah, the government is supposed to provide law and guidance to people so that we all have the same rights and responsibilities.\n\nLet’s talk a bit about the federal government. What does the federal government do well?\n\nFund its military.\n\nCollect taxes. That’s not a good thing.\n\nProvide complicated explanations for why it does what it does.\n\nNot all the people they’re helping deserve the help, but they do supply help to people who are needy, like vets. I think they could do better.\n\nA great segue into my next question: Who is the federal government good at helping?\n\nRich people.\n\nI think they do take care of businesses, so as to ensure that there’s work and jobs.\n\nWhat about state and local government? What are some things they do well, maybe even better than the federal government?\n\nEverything.\n\nThey are more in tune with what our citizens need, our local citizens. A lot of agencies here in North Carolina are local, and they kind of have an ear to what our local people need.\n\nNorth Carolina is definitely pushing the boundaries of working for itself versus for the people. We’ve seen a lot of legislation passed recently that really doesn’t have the best interest of the people, along with a lot of tactics to try to block votes. So while state governments certainly are more in tune across the board, I think North Carolina is testing the limits of what would have been acceptable in the past.\n\nWhat are some things the federal government doesn’t do so well?\n\nI don’t think the federal government does well with FEMA. I think that they’ve let the people of Western North Carolina down.\n\nThere’s been an attempt at combating rampant misinformation. I see all of these documents and websites that try to help people understand what’s actually happening in government and with FEMA. But it seems to just kind of create more mistrust and misinformation. I don’t really know how to combat that, but I think that we could explore other ways to build confidence in our government than tip sheets and fact sheets.\n\nI think the federal government did a terrible job on the Covid response with their overreach. They threw a lot of businesses, especially restaurants and small business owners, in a big wreck, and they silenced alternative methods of treatments for Covid.\n\nIn Washington there’s a lot of discussion about making some pretty big changes to the federal government, including reducing its size. What have people heard about the changes that have been happening in the federal government?\n\nObviously, I hear about Elon Musk and DOGE and the sledgehammer that they’re taking to a lot of the government agencies. There was a memo about laying off 80,000 workers in the V.A. A lot of those are veterans. So I think there’s definitely waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government that needs to be corrected. But I think we need to use a scalpel, not a sledgehammer. And I think it’s causing a lot of problems in the country.\n\nWe have a shadow president. Elon Musk is running the country, and Trump isn’t. And he is sitting here, tearing apart the country. All these people are being laid off. It’s just a mess. I voted Republican before, so it’s nothing against them. But what they’re doing is totally wrong.\n\nWhat, in particular, do you think is wrong about it?\n\nThat all these people are losing their jobs, veterans. There aren’t any jobs. Cuts to services, U.S.A.I.D. It’s everything. The markets are down. Farmers might lose their farms. It’s just terrible, what’s happening right now.\n\nAll the layoffs are very concerning. We’re losing jobs in the technical aspects like NOAA and the National Weather Service. They recently shut down classes for the National Fire Training Academy because all those jobs and funding were cut. And those are not just somebody pushing a piece of paper somewhere. Those vital jobs that are needed to support the whole country.\n\nI think the cuts are absolutely good. We’ve spent billions of dollars for other countries and crazy programs like transgender research in other countries and all kinds of idiotic, non-common-sense expenditures of taxpayer dollars. And that has to change. It’s been going on for years, government waste on both sides.\n\nI want to switch gears a bit to North Carolina and Hurricane Helene. First, what’s your favorite thing about living in North Carolina?\n\nI love that I am roughly an hour and a half from virtually everything except the beach. There’s a big city relatively close by. I can go up to the mountains and hike. I can go over to nice flatlands. We’ve got really good lakes here.\n\nI similarly love the variety that we have. The mountains are so beautiful, with amazing hikes. We have beautiful beaches and big cities, lakes and a very rich history.\n\nComing from New York — the quality of life here is, hands down, the best. The air smells different. You’re not in a rush to go nowhere like we are in New York. I just love being here. And moving here was the best decision I’ve ever made my whole life.\n\nObviously, a major part of life in Western North Carolina in the last year has been Hurricane Helene. What’s the first thing that comes to mind when I say “Hurricane Helene”?\n\nDevastating.\n\nHorrific.\n\nWrecked.\n\nAbsolute disaster.\n\nDevastating.\n\nYeah, devastating.\n\nDestruction.\n\nWhen I first moved to North Carolina as a kid, it was actually a week before Hurricane Hugo hit. That was a profound experience that I carry with me. Preparedness becomes a focal point with every bad storm because my dad was in construction. Still, with Hurricane Helene, it happened to be that even though they said, “Here’s the worst thing that could happen,” it was still worse.\n\nI lived in Florida for 16 years. So I was prepared, as far as my husband and my immediate needs. But I wasn’t prepared for the road coming up and the waters just doing what they did. I feel like I was as prepared as I could be, though.\n\nPorscha, you said 1. Tell me why you feel you weren’t prepared.\n\nI’m also from New York. I went through Hurricane Sandy. At that time, people seemed to know what was going to happen. The need to evacuate, the danger zone — all that was clear. With Helene, although we watched the news, I don’t think anybody had even a clue that it was going to get that bad. One day, you’re living one way, and the next day, it’s just gone.\n\nWas there a specific moment when you all realized this was a bad storm?\n\nI was out of the country when it was happening. I was keeping up with the news, and no one was texting me back. It would take weeks to reach friends and family. And it was weird because they didn’t know what was happening, given that there was difficulty with transportation and the phones were down. Somehow I was more informed than people who were going through it in real time.\n\nFor me, things got real when our highway and a lot of the major roads were completely blocked. That was a doozy.\n\nWhen the stream in front of my house was coming up to my front door and I was seeing bridges go underwater, I thought, “OK, we’re in trouble.”\n\nI wasn’t personally affected by the hurricane, but my aunt was. When I wasn’t able to get in touch with her and I heard that everybody lost power for weeks on end, I knew that things were really bad. Where I’m from, we got a few downed trees and lost power for a day or two.\n\nWhere do you feel you got the most accurate information about what was happening in the days when the storm was happening and in the immediate aftermath?\n\nIt was really difficult to get accurate information during the storm. But in the aftermath Blue Ridge Public Radio was the best information that I came across. They started sending daily text messages on what they knew, and they continued to do that until we had our water back and clean.\n\nIt’s about the same with us. Our county, they were sending us alerts on our phone. That’s how I got it before the storm.\n\nDid you encounter anything that just didn’t turn out to be true or that was misleading?\n\nThat happens a lot with regular media. They try to jump on the story just to get something on the air. But they don’t have either all the information or enough facts. My two-way radio connected me with a lot of North Carolina, including the VIPER Network, the radio network for the public safety officials across the entire state.\n\nThere was a lot of politicization of the event because it was right before the big election. And there was a lot of blaming. There was a lot of misinformation about who was getting helped, who was not getting help, who was flying helicopters, who wasn’t. So a lot of stories that came out — a lot of things got debunked. A lot of things actually were true to some degree, but there was just a lot of things trying to polarize people instead of bringing us all together.\n\nWe were without internet for the better part of two weeks. And that meant that most people were finding information on their phones, and even then, you still couldn’t get much. So a lot of people were focusing on social media, where they could get little bursts of things. There was a lot of, “Oh, well, I heard someone say this.” Seeing it through that lens pretty consistently, there were things that were getting spread that were very obviously not true. But people were not in a position to fact-check it, and that’s why it was going rampant.\n\nPorscha, I’ll start with you. Why did you give the government a 1?\n\nI have family that was directly affected, and they just expressed to me how terrible it was, especially immediately after, to get help or support or even just an understanding of what’s all going on or when they will get help or when or how or anything. They didn’t feel safe, secure or any of the things that I said government is responsible for.\n\nI also said 1. Locally, I think things went well. In the western part of the state, absolutely not. There are still people living in tents. It’s not right. I was denied my FEMA claim for damage over $15,000 at my home, and they won’t do anything about it.\n\nI have family members that are still living in trailers. And just like Mark, their claims were denied. The local government, the state, they had food. They had everything. But as far as help from the government and FEMA, they didn’t offer the help you’d think they would.\n\nI watch both sides of the news, left and right, and try to get a common-sense truth among the polar opposite viewpoints politically. Local government and churches, they were more helpful. Definitely not FEMA. And they’re the ones that supposedly have all the money.\n\nI will tell you this till the day I die: If it had not been for people coming, volunteers coming from all over the United States — we saw people from Georgia and Florida and Oregon and California and Texas — I don’t know what these people would have done without the volunteers.\n\nThere have been a lot of different organizations that have really stepped up to do whatever they can. Some of them are funded by FEMA, and I’ve worked with a few of those. I want to make sure that everybody knows that FEMA did more than just work with those funds that directly came to us.\n\nI’m sure FEMA funds lots of different things, and I’m sure some of the money went to good use. But there was one organization that we were working with, donating water and things, and they would truck the supplies up to the mountains. My grandparents live up there and were without power and water. And to be fair, I know they want to make sure things are safe and things aren’t getting too crowded. But we simply weren’t allowed to go and bring supplies. So that was really frustrating.\n\nWhen it comes to the recovery from something like this, what do you think were the most helpful things that the government did?\n\nIn Asheville, we got a lot of attention. The Army Corps of Engineers came in to help rebuild and clean up the main water treatment plant. Their efforts were very quick, very direct, with constant updates.\n\nThe $700 they gave people, it was very demonized, a lot of controversy to say that that was all people got. But just the fact that people got that immediate funds to help buy supplies and do things — and, I mean, I wasn’t affected, but I know people who were.\n\nAre there any people, leaders or organizations that you think of more highly after seeing how they responded to the disaster?\n\nSamaritan’s Purse. They were doing a lot of volunteering and a lot of cleaning up for the western part of North Carolina, along with a lot of church leaders and organizations, too.\n\nLocal church leaders and local businesses.\n\nI would agree about Samaritan’s Purse. I know they had a huge volume of volunteers. I volunteered with them in Asheville.\n\nGiven my own family’s experience with denied claims, I’m just seeing a gray, negative cloud over everyone’s handling of it. I just think there wasn’t a lot of attention. I can kind of see offering a shaky hand for Biden-Harris. But it wasn’t enough. And even now, I don’t think that people understand that so much more help is needed. I think we’re almost forgotten.\n\nThere’s only so much either side can really do, you know? But I still put my hand up for Trump-Vance because the bare minimum you can do is just show up and show your support with the community and just be there and offer whatever resources you have. At least go see some of the devastation yourself and really understand and talk to the people.\n\nKirsten, you gave Biden-Harris at least a halfway raising of your hand on that one.\n\nThere were immediate funds released post-hurricane. Maybe you’d expect either presidency to do that, but that just happened to be the presidency at the time of the hurricane. They did fly over. I remember that. I think it was inappropriate to be on the ground. The roads were blocked, so I think that was the right thing to do, to fly over, not to actually be going into the town and closing the few roads we had open. And that’s something we saw with the Trump visit. I don’t know what Trump has done, if anything. I know he wants to gut FEMA. So how is that helpful? That’s my perspective.\n\nTrump got elected on Tuesday, and he was here on Friday. And I think those people needed to see that the government was there. I think they just needed reassurance, hope, whatever.\n\nWhat has the national media gotten right about how Helene affected you? What has it gotten wrong?\n\nI think there needs to be more attention to the stories of the people that are suffering. I would say it’s just not loud enough.\n\nI think that the media attention was so short-lived.\n\nAll the way down in Swannanoa, I saw people still in tents. They need to come back and show those people in tents. It’s almost forgotten. And I get it. You start living your life.\n\nIt’s like it’s old news.\n\nDid your experience with Helene change the way you think about other natural disasters, like the fires in Los Angeles?\n\nMy first thought was very selfishly like, “There goes any new support coverage for Western North Carolina. We’re moving on to the next big thing.” And rightfully so, on one hand, because that was devastating. But we’re always moving on to the next story. So it just felt like, “Well, here comes the end for our coverage.”\n\nI see a few people nodding.\n\nAnd then, of course, I also felt a complete sense of loss for them because how horrifying for all those people, whether they lost their homes or just smoke damage that makes their home uninhabitable. And third, concern about FEMA — we were lucky to get a lot of money in 2024. So the 2025 bucket is probably going heavily out there. And then what does that leave for the rest of the storm season for the rest of the U.S.?\n\nYou had the fires in Hawaii, which has now been — what? — two years ago, and they haven’t rebuilt yet. Now you’ve got all these fires in California. How long is it going to take to rebuild that? How long is it going to take to rebuild Western North Carolina? The whole system of fixing things is broken. Everything that’s supposed to be in place is not there.\n\nHas this experience changed how you think about where you live in the United States? For the people who feel there’s a climate change element here, do you feel like the government helps you make decisions about where to live? Has anything about this experience changed how you think about the kind of home or neighborhood or place you would live in if you moved?\n\nThe last flooding we had in this area was, like, a hundred years ago. So I know this was just a fluke. I better knock on wood that it was a fluke. But I don’t think it would make me change.\n\nI know now that I need to be more prepared, that I need to have as many resources as I possibly can for myself. I was a kid as well when Hurricane Hugo came through. And then I went through this one. So it changed my thinking — not expecting that the government would come through and help. Or if they did, I felt like they just did drive-bys.\n\nI would just stay right where I am. It’s all part of nature and life.\n\nI used to worry about the disasters where I’d live but not anymore. Not at all.\n\nSydney mentioned tip sheets at the beginning of our call. There were a lot of claims swirling around last year, some of which turned out to be false. Do you trust FEMA to give accurate information about things like this?\n\nI don’t trust FEMA. It’s not really saying anything bad about FEMA. I think that the state should handle stuff like that because FEMA, when I did see FEMA, they had no idea about the area. They didn’t know the hollers and places like that. So while giving them credit for what they do, they were almost lost in some cases.\n\nUnpopular opinion: I think FEMA serves a very valuable purpose as the federal response to handle emergency management situations, like the California fires and all the things we have. I mean, Helene hit Florida. It hit Georgia. It hit South Carolina. It was not just Western North Carolina. I think it was a very difficult job because of things that Nina just talked about, all the little hollers and areas up there in the terrain. But I’m scared of losing FEMA or having FEMA be cut and when the next hurricane or natural disaster happens under this administration or moving forward. FEMA is not perfect, but I think it serves a valuable purpose.\n\nI just don’t trust the government hardly at all, anyway, for a lot of reasons, federal government and state. I’m going to say more services should be privatized. Even FEMA could be privatized, I think.\n\nI think there is value to what FEMA does. But I want it ensured that the money’s going to the communities that need help. And I do have a distrust for the government in general. I just want to make sure that the tax dollars they collect go to these communities and go to things that are really going to benefit the country.\n\nThis is a great time to bring up insurance, because that is a form of coverage, privatized coverage. We’ve talked a lot about FEMA, government support. We’re losing insurance in Florida and California and coastal North Carolina because of natural disasters. We pay into it. That’s a private-ish way to get your money back. And a lot of these insurance claims are denied 100 percent. So I think we’ve tried that, and it failed.\n\nOn the topic of insurance: There are some parts of the country where we know natural disasters are more likely, places where we know floods, fires or storms are expected. And in some of those places lately, these private insurers have started leaving markets. What do you think should be done when it comes to insuring people who live in areas that private insurers do not want to insure anymore?\n\nInsurance — that’s a huge part of the problem. They paid my claim but didn’t cover near everything that they should have. But insurance needs to replace these houses and everything. It is crazy. They keep raising the cost, and what do you get in return? I mean, I guess you do get some peace of mind, but there’s so many different riders.\n\nWell, I had experience with the insurance company, and I called them twice a day, every day. I didn’t have any problems. They paid my claims, but it’s probably because I bugged them to death. They were sick of hearing from me. And to be honest with you, I have no idea how to solve that.\n\nI just think that any insurer that is going to be on the market, there should be something that our government puts down that says, “If you are going to function as a business, you are required to provide your services to anyone willing to pay for it.” And there should be a limit to how much that person needs to pay, because we don’t want it where there’s suddenly price gouging. But everyone should be able to get insurance. And the government is one of those entities that can step in and help make that happen.\n\nIf you could tell government officials one thing about your experience as someone who lived through Helene or has watched as close family members and friends have gone through this, what would you say?\n\nI wish the government would know what the victims went through, actually. I want the government to be more helpful, to be more in tune with them.\n\nTake a chapter from the local response. I know the government on a federal level has way more resources than local. But I just wish that they would have a continued and forceful effort in the way that local government has.\n\nPeople are really suffering out there. And they need to really step up their game and send people the help that they need.\n\nI would say that these are real people that did not think that this would ever happen to them in the mountains, and that means it could happen anywhere.\n\nHave better coordination with local volunteer efforts. I think that was a big problem, that they weren’t listening to the people in the street who were trying to help and were taking a little bit too much control.\n\nMake readiness a priority, be more proactive and prioritize funds so that we are fully prepared to handle these situations.\n\nI wish they would understand how cold it is in the winter in the mountains.

        "full_text": "In the run up to today's call, Donald Trump made a big deal of his conversation with Russia's Vladimir Putin.\n\nBut the results look like there's little to shout about.\n\nThe Russian president has given the US leader just enough to claim that he made progress towards peace in Ukraine, without making it look like he was played by the Kremlin.\n\nTrump can point to Putin's pledge to halt attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure for 30 days. If that actually happens, it will bring some relief to civilians.\n\nBut it's nowhere near the full and unconditional ceasefire that the US wanted from Russia.\n\nThe \"very horrible war\" Trump has insisted he can stop is still raging.\n\nAnd Putin, a man indicted as a suspected war criminal by the ICC, has been given a leg-up back to the top tier of global politics.\n\nRussian state media report that the two presidents' phone call lasted more than two hours. The Kremlin readout – its account of the call – is also long at 500 words.\n\nIt presents the conversation as chatty: they apparently discussed ice hockey, the kind of detail an audience back in Russia will lap up.\n\nAfter three years as a pariah in the western world, and frosty relations long before that, Russia is back dealing directly with a US administration that wants to engage.\n\nThe two leaders are even discussing Middle East peace and \"global security\".\n\nThe Kremlin must be struggling to believe the transformation.\n\nAhead of the call, some wondered whether Donald Trump might actually pile some pressure on Russia. After all, it's been clear for over a week that it was stalling on the ceasefire.\n\nBut there's no sign of a dressing down for Putin like the one Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky had to endure in the Oval Office a fortnight ago.\n\nBoth countries' accounts suggest nothing has changed.\n\nRussia repeats that it wants peace. But instead of grounding its drones and silencing its guns, it's quibbling over how a still non-existent ceasefire might be monitored.\n\nMeanwhile, it's adding even more conditions aimed at crippling Kyiv's ability to resist.\n\nOne demand is that the flow of both weapons and intelligence to Ukraine from its allies has to cease.\n\nFor Ukrainians, the only sliver of hope is that the US hasn't agreed to any of this – yet.\n\nThey can also point to the call as more proof that Russia has no interest in ending its invasion.\n\nBut all that talking will bring Ukraine minimal relief from its suffering.\n\nFor US diplomacy, too, it has to be disappointing.\n\nBut for the Kremlin it will feel like a pretty decent day, the kind unimaginable before Donald Trump returned to the White House.",

        "full_text": "A federal judge on Tuesday blocked the EPA from clawing back some $20 billion in climate money the Trump administration said was shoved out the door by a departing Biden administration.\n\nU.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan said the Environmental Protection Agency gave “no legal justification” for why it tried to reclaim the money or given the recipients of the money no chance to object or challenge the decision.\n\nShe issued a temporary restraining order against the EPA.\n\n“To be sure, agencies can decide to re-evaluate their programs, or they may decide to end agreements or federal awards. But those decisions must be made lawfully and in accordance with established procedures and relevant rules and regulations,” the judge wrote.\n\nThe money had become symbolic of the Biden administration’s last-minute efforts to “Trump-proof” the government.\n\nProject Veritas late last year captured an official revealing EPA’s plans to push money out the door, in what he compared to “throwing gold bars off the Titanic.”\n\nNew EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin made it his mission to recapture the money, and earlier this month he declared success.\n\n“The days of ‘throwing gold bars off the Titanic’ are over,” he said. “I have taken action to terminate these grants riddled with self-dealing and wasteful spending. EPA will be an exceptional steward of taxpayer dollars dedicated to our core mission of protecting human health and the environment, not a frivolous spender in the name of ’climate equity.’”\n\nHe said the Biden administration was unable to spend all the money before it left but it “parked” the funds at Citibank. Mr. Zeldin pressed Citibank to stop releasing the money to the organizations that won the grants from the Biden administration.\n\nThe money was part of Democrats’ 2022 climate-budget bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, which pumped a massive amount of taxpayer money into clean energy and environmental grants.",

        "full_text": "What’s the latest? Putin and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy are each supporting a 30-day pause in attacks on “energy and infrastructure,” such as power plants and refineries. The planned pause follows a lengthy phone call between Trump and Putin earlier today.\n\nPutin did not agree to a full ceasefire, which Trump has proposed and which Ukraine had assented to earlier. Russia put out a post-call statement suggesting that it would only agree if foreign countries cut off military and intelligence aid to Ukraine — a demand Trump has not agreed to.\n\nWhat hasn’t changed? Fighting along the front lines, and presumably also drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities, will continue. The US will also continue providing weapons and intelligence to Ukraine, after briefly suspending both earlier this month.\n\nWhat’s the big picture for Ukraine? The optimistic take on what happened today is that the two sides are talking — via the US — and that this could be the basis for a broader ceasefire. On the other hand, recent statements from Russian officials suggest they’re still pushing for a demilitarized and subservient Ukraine. And Putin may be doing just enough to keep Trump happy while continuing to press his advantage on the battlefield.\n\nWhat did we learn about Trump? Trump didn’t totally sell Ukraine out, which seemed like a real possibility just a few weeks ago. On the other hand, he also doesn’t seem to put pressure on Russia to agree to a real ceasefire, as he did with Ukraine. Trump’s own statement about the call makes it seem like he was satisfied with the result, despite Putin’s unwillingness to back down.\n\nPart of the lure of social media is the promise of external validation, and so I really appreciated this piece from my Vox colleague Allie Volpe. It explains why we’re hard-wired to seek validation — and how we can avoid being trapped by that need. I particularly loved this line: “What is far more nourishing than the sugar high of validation is an internal process of recognizing your own worthiness.”\n\nIt’s easier said than done, but, for me at least, it’s a good aspiration.

        "full_text": "Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino.\n\nFollowing the release of the latest jobs report on March 7, President Donald Trump suggested that his administration — which has been in office since Jan. 20 — is responsible for significant job growth. The growth in February was steady, but to support his claims, Trump made several misleading statements about the economy he inherited.\n\nThe February jobs report delivered on expectations, saying that the economy added 151,000 jobs — slightly below the forecasted 160,000. The unemployment rate was 4.1%, up marginally from 4% in January.\n\nEconomists described the report as showing a generally steady labor market for now, with Brookings Institution fellow and University of Michigan professor Justin Wolfers calling the report “splendidly dull.”\n\nWe’ll unpack three of the claims Trump made on March 7 during his remarks from the Oval Office about the report.\n\nThe president compared the 9,000 new auto manufacturing jobs in February to a loss of more than 27,000 jobs in President Joe Biden’s last year — ignoring that there was a net gain of those jobs over Biden’s entire term. He also suggested that his tariff policy was responsible for the new jobs, but Trump’s tariffs had not yet been enacted in the period covered by the jobs report.\n\nHe claimed to be “presiding over a brand-new domestic manufacturing boom after major collapse under Biden,” but an expert told us he’s been in office for too short of a time to have effected any major economic change. And the data show there was a net gain in manufacturing jobs during Biden’s administration.\n\nTrump cherry-picked data to misleadingly claim that “1 in every 4 jobs created in America was a government job” in Biden’s last two years as president, while “93% of all job gains” during the first full month of Trump’s second term “were in the private sector.” During Biden’s entire presidency, about 11% of the jobs added were government jobs, the vast majority of which were state and local government jobs.\n\nAuto Manufacturing Jobs\n\nTrump highlighted gains in auto manufacturing jobs, saying, “in a single month, 9,000 new auto jobs. You haven’t heard that in a long time. After autoworkers lost more than 27,000 auto jobs in the final year of Biden.”\n\nTrump’s figures are correct, but over Biden’s entire term, auto manufacturing jobs went up.\n\nWhile there hasn’t been monthly job growth since July, over Biden’s term, motor vehicle and parts jobs went up by 47,000. Employment in January was 9,900 higher than the pre-pandemic level in February 2020.\n\nAnd while Trump claimed that before the February increase, there hadn’t been such a large one-month jump “in a long time,” there were larger one-month increases under Biden. The February jobs report showed an increase since January of 8,900 jobs in the manufacturing of motor vehicles and parts. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there was an increase of 28,400 jobs in that sector between October and November 2023.\n\nAlso, just because the one-month increase happened while Trump is in office doesn’t necessarily mean that he’s responsible for it, Alan Tonelson, a longtime analyst of U.S. manufacturing policy who blogs at RealityChek, told us in a phone interview.\n\nThe kinds of decisions that result in jobs are long-term decisions, Tonelson said, using the example of new factories, which take time to build.\n\nTrump, though, claimed that his tariff policies had already affected the February job numbers. He said the reason for the one-month gain was “largely” because car companies “think things are happening, so they’re already geared up. In some cases, they had rooms in their plants, or they had empty plants that they were able to put into use quickly because they see — because of the tariffs. They don’t want to be dealing with other places,” he said, mentioning Mexico and Canada.\n\nWhen we asked the White House about the president’s claim, it provided examples of auto companies making announcements about new plants or production. But most of the plans began before Trump took office, and it’s unclear if any of them led to new jobs in February.\n\nThe White House pointed to production at a Georgia Hyundai plant. Construction of the vehicle and battery manufacturing plant was announced in 2022, and it began producing electric cars in October. However, the CEO, José Muñoz, has pointed to Hyundai’s investment in U.S. production over the last few years as insulation from potential tariffs from the Trump administration.\n\nThe White House also pointed to two announcements of plants opening — for electric batteries and electric vehicles — but the projects were in the works well before Trump’s election.\n\nIt also cited a $1.5 million Michigan Economic Development Program grant that is anticipated to create 144 jobs manufacturing hydrogen fuel cells and plans for a Chicago-area assembly plant to reopen in 2027. Plans to reopen the assembly plant were announced shortly after the company’s chairman met with Trump and months after a pressure campaign from the United Auto Workers. But neither of those projects has produced jobs yet.\n\nAnd the White House pointed to the same March 3 Reuters story that the president appeared to reference in his address to a joint session of Congress on March 4, when he said that Honda had announced it would build a new plant in Indiana. But after that address, Honda told a news station in Indianapolis: “Honda has made no such announcement and will not comment on this report. The Honda Civic has been made in our Indiana Auto Plant since the facility opened in 2008 based on our longstanding approach to build products close to the customer. We have the flexibility to produce products in each region based on customer needs and market conditions.”\n\nSo, it’s unclear if Honda is planning to change its Indiana operations due to tariffs, but no jobs associated with any potential change would have been included in the February report, either.\n\nIt remains to be seen what impact Trump’s tariff policies might have on the auto industry. So far, 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel imports went into effect on March 12, with the EU and Canada immediately implementing retaliatory tariffs. Broad 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, including on vehicles, are largely on hold until April 2.\n\nSome industry watchers have been skeptical of the benefits from tariffs for the auto industry. “Ultimately, in a global automotive business that relies on a large and complicated supply chain, higher tariffs will only challenge further an industry already wrestling with high costs and small margins,” Cox Automotive wrote in an early February analysis.\n\nManufacturing Jobs\n\nThe president also said, “Our administration is presiding over a brand-new domestic manufacturing boom after major collapse under Biden.”\n\nBut the data don’t support that claim.\n\nTrump said, “During the last year, the Biden administration saw a loss of more than 110,000 manufacturing jobs. … During the first full month in office, we’ve not only stopped that manufacturing collapse, but we’ve begun to rapidly reverse it and get major gains. We created 10,000 manufacturing jobs in February alone. That hasn’t happened in a long time.”\n\nThere was a 20,000 gain in manufacturing jobs in November, so it has only been a few months since there has been such a one-month increase.\n\nTrump is correct about the net loss over Biden’s last year — it was 111,000 — but again, over Biden’s four years, manufacturing jobs went up by 610,000. In January, there were almost 12.8 million manufacturing jobs, 12,000 more than in February 2020, before the pandemic.\n\nFactory construction also reached the highest level in more than 50 years in 2024, according to a report from Moody’s Analytics.\n\nForbes wrote last year that Biden-era policies, including the CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act, “spurred an influx of foreign direct investment and a surge in factory construction. But the anticipated jobs have taken a while to materialize in great numbers and will not arrive until after his presidency ends.”\n\nWhen Trump touted the “brand-new domestic manufacturing boom,” he said that it had been “confirmed” by the ISM and S&P manufacturing surveys, which are conducted by private companies that survey purchasing managers to provide an indicator of economic conditions.\n\nThe surveys did report expansion in manufacturing.\n\nThe S&P survey reported that “February survey data indicated an acceleration in the rate of US manufacturing sector expansion.” However, it said there was “some evidence” that the growth was “partially driven by advanced purchases ahead of likely price increases and possible supply disruption related to further tariff impositions in the coming months.”\n\nThe ISM for February said that the sector “expanded for the second month in a row in February after 26 consecutive months of contraction.” Many survey respondents reporting uncertainty and volatility due to tariffs.\n\n“Manufacturing, generally speaking, is cyclical,” Tonelson said. “Manufacturing is quite export heavy,” so it depends on what’s happening in other countries, too.\n\nBut, overall, Tonelson said, “I don’t think that one can make any reasonable conclusion about booming of anything after just about a month and a half. In terms of manufacturing jobs, we’ve only got one month of data on President Trump’s watch this time.”\n\nPublic vs. Private Jobs\n\nTrump also used cherry-picked statistics when comparing government and private-sector jobs added under him and Biden.\n\n“Under the final two years of Biden, 1 in every 4 jobs created in America was a government job. That’s a tremendous percentage,” he said. “But under the first full month of President Trump, which we haven’t even gotten started yet, an incredible 93% of all job gains were in the private sector.”\n\nIt’s true that about one-quarter, or roughly 26%, of the jobs added in Biden’s last two years in office were government jobs, which includes positions in federal, state and local government. However, during Biden’s entire presidency, about 11% of the jobs added were government jobs — including some jobs that were lost, but quickly regained, during the pandemic. And about 9 in 10 of the government jobs gained were at the state and local level, which Biden had no direct say in.\n\nMeasuring from June 2022, when total employment finally surpassed the pre-pandemic high in February 2020, about 22% of the increase in employment was government jobs. Again, roughly 90% of the jobs were in state and local government.\n\nIt’s also misleading to compare one month of private-sector job growth at the start of Trump’s second term — about 93% of the jobs gained in February were private-sector jobs, as Trump said — to a much longer period under Biden.\n\nFor instance, in December, one of Biden’s final months in office, only 11% of all jobs added were government jobs. A month before that in November, it was about 6.5%. There were also a few months during Biden’s last two years in office when there was an increase in total jobs but a decline in government jobs.",

        "full_text": "Rep. Brandon Gill of Texas, a conservative hard-liner, quickly followed through on Trump’s call, filing a measure to remove U.S. District Judge James Boasberg for seeking to “prioritize political gain over the duty of impartiality owed to the public.”\n\nImpeachment proceedings, even when they don’t involve presidents, can be time- and resource-intensive affairs. Boasberg, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, is the fourth federal trial judge this year to be targeted with an impeachment filing from a congressional Republican after ruling against the Trump administration. But his is the first to draw backing from Trump.\n\nPublicly, key GOP leaders are not closing the door on potential impeachments.\n\n“Everything is on the table,” said Russell Dye, a spokesperson for House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who would oversee impeachment proceedings. A Johnson spokesperson said judges “with political agendas pose a significant threat” and that the speaker “looks forward to working with the Judiciary Committee as they review all available options under the Constitution to address this urgent matter.”\n\nBut privately there is dread inside Johnson’s leadership circle about the prospect of having to pursue messy, certain-to-fail impeachments that could ultimately backfire on the GOP’s razor-thin majority.\n\n“It’s never going to happen,” said a senior House Republican aide. “There aren’t the votes.”\n\n“It would be such a heavy lift and we’ve got too many heavy lifts coming up,” said another top GOP aide. “What is the endgame here?”\n\nA third said GOP leaders and even some conservative House members are “rolling their eyes” at the impeachment filings that “aren’t going to go anywhere.”\n\nThe decision on how hard to push will ultimately fall to Johnson, a former constitutional lawyer who has so far resisted the hard-liners’ push to wage what many within his own leadership circle view as an unprecedented and wide-reaching congressional assault on the courts.\n\nBut Trump’s intervention this time could change that calculation — even as he stares down a punishing self-imposed deadline for advancing a massive tax, energy and border policy package before his members leave Washington next month for the Easter and Passover break. Johnson is heavily reliant on Trump to maintain his tenuous control over his fractious conference, and senior Republicans believe the speaker will likely need to offer some sort of concession to serve as a release valve as pressure builds on the MAGA right.\n\nFellow hard-liners cheered Gill on Tuesday, but there were signs of discomfort elsewhere in the House GOP.\n\n“I don’t support it,” said Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.). “If their behavior was criminal, that is different.”\n\n“I do not support impeaching a sitting judge based solely on a decision with which I disagree,” said another House GOP lawmaker, granted anonymity to speak candidly, who nevertheless agreed that Boasberg had “overstepped his authority” in ordering the halt to deportations under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act.\n\nBoth members echoed Chief Justice John Roberts in arguing that the courts, not Congress, were the proper place for Trump to address an adverse ruling.\n\nOutside of the House, there appears to be even less of an appetite for impeachment.\n\nIn the Senate, which would be required to take up any impeachment as soon as articles come over from the House, Republicans have previously greeted the idea with disdain.\n\n“Idiotic,” said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) when asked about the proposed judicial impeachments earlier this month, before Trump weighed in.\n\n“You don’t impeach judges who make decisions you disagree with, because that happens all the time,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said around the same time. “What you do is you appeal, and if you’re right, then you’re going to win on appeal.”\n\nBoth men sit on the Senate Judiciary Committee, whose chair, Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), has spoken out about the need to “solve the problem of judicial overreach,” citing trial court orders that have national impacts, but has not commented on the calls for impeachments.\n\nSome conservative lawyers with close ties to the administration have also warned against such a confrontation with the judiciary.\n\n“Unpopular opinion: No judge will be impeached in connection with activist unconstitutional TRO’s & injunctions against the Trump Administration,” attorney Ron Coleman, a former law partner of Trump White House Counsel David Warrington, wrote on X amid a prior flurry of impeachment talk. “Strategically the Administration would be insane to try.”\n\nColeman stood his ground Tuesday, saying he supports Roberts’ statement urging politicians not to impeach judges over their rulings.\n\nDespite Trump’s public posting Tuesday, it remains unclear just how hard he will push for impeachments of Boasberg or any other judges who have questioned his powers. Multiple Republicans close to the issue on the Hill say that Trump has not urged them to impeach anyone. But that could change if judges continue to hand down unfavorable rulings.\n\nA small faction of Trump’s most diehard Hill supporters have been railing against the judiciary for weeks already — and are likely to keep the heat on Johnson to move forward.\n\nWhile there is wide skepticism about the impeachment efforts — some Republicans have privately noted errors in some of the articles already filed — there are more serious talks among conservatives about trying to block funding for lower-level courts.\n\n“They’re activists trying to stifle his agenda … radical left-leaning nutjobs in black robes trying to stop Trump,” said Rep. Troy Nehls (R-Texas), adding that lawmakers need to “send a message” even if the impeachments don’t ultimately succeed.\n\nRoberts’ decision to speak out Tuesday only emboldened the GOP’s right flank, which has never been especially fond of the George W. Bush–nominated chief justice.\n\n“Respectfully, Mr. Chief Justice, both James Madison and Thomas Jefferson disagree with you. So does the Constitution,” read an X posting from Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.), who filed impeachment articles against two federal judges last month.\n\n“We are going to keep the impeachments coming,” Ogles added.",

        "full_text": "Republican lawmakers are conflicted over how to respond to President Trump’s confrontational standoff with the federal judiciary, which drew a rare public rebuke Tuesday from Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nTrump and his allies are directing their attacks more frequently against judges who threaten to slow or block the president’s ambitious agenda, putting GOP lawmakers in an uncomfortable spot.\n\nRepublican officeholders are leery of criticizing Trump for fear of becoming the target of his wrath or a primary challenge, yet privately they worry about the president’s efforts to expand his executive power, which could reverberate far into the future.\n\nWhile a few Republican senators and House members have publicly cheered the Trump administration in its battle with a federal judge who ordered it to halt the deportation of several hundred Venezuelans to El Salvador, many more are keeping quiet.\n\n“Republicans, by and large, will support Trump publicly because of the situation — we’re dealing with Venezuelan gang members, and most Americans agree they should have been deported,” a senior Republican strategist said of the reaction to the Trump administration going forward with a deportation flights despite an order by a federal judge to stop them.\n\n“Privately, most congressional Republicans will think this is really going right up to the line on having a constitutional crisis, and that situations like this need to be avoided in the future,” the strategist added. “They do believe in due process.\n\n“There will be future situations where hearings are necessary, and continuing to go against judicial rulings will be politically precarious for Trump,” the strategist warned, noting Trump’s direct challenge to federal judge’s authority caught many lawmakers off guard Tuesday.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have urged Trump to heed the federal court rulings he disagrees with and to challenge them in the appeals process instead of flouting court orders.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said last month that “the White House should comply with court rulings,” voicing a concern shared by a number of GOP lawmakers.\n\n“We have a judicial system. If you don’t like the ruling, you can appeal the ruling and you can follow that through. But we are a nation of laws, and it is not necessarily for you or I to be the final arbiter here. This is why we entrust the judiciary with this responsibility,” she said.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) has said the courts have a “valid role and need to be listened to.”\n\nThey and many other GOP lawmakers didn’t address the issue Tuesday after Trump called for the impeachment of Judge James Boasberg, the chief judge of the federal district court of the District of Columbia, who ordered the halting of flights carrying people to El Salvador.\n\nTrump called the judge, who was appointed to his seat by former President Obama, “a troublemaker and agitator.”\n\n“This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges’ I am forced to appear before, should be impeached!!” he declared on Truth Social, suggesting many the deportees were “VICIOUS, VIOLENT AND DEMENTED CRIMINALS.”\n\nThat statement drew pushback from Roberts, who declared that threatening to impeach the judge over a legal disagreement is “inappropriate.”\n\nThe Trump administration sought to deport the migrants under the Aliens Enemies Act of 1798, a seldom-cited law that previously has been invoked during times of war.\n\nTrump’s call for impeaching Boasberg was immediately supported by Rep. Brandon Gill (R-Texas), who introduced a resolution to impeach Boasberg.\n\nThe idea of impeaching federal judges who rule against Trump was not popular with Senate Republicans when tech billionaire Elon Musk, one of Trump’s closest advisors, floated it last month.\n\n“Wrong, wrong, wrong. Get him out of the White House. Get him out, the sooner the better,” one GOP senator told The Hill last month.\n\n“Every day that he’s there, he seems more destructive,” the source said of Musk.\n\nThe Republican strategist warned that Trump’s battle with Republican-appointed jurists such as Roberts is a bad look for the president, politically.\n\n“Trump is once again breaking norms,” the strategist said. “It does raise the visibility of [the issue] and I don’t think it intimidates the judges, either.\n\n“If power ends up in a Democratic White House and [a Democratic president] ignores judicial rulings, Republicans will be reminded of his situation. Hopefully, this is an anomaly,” the source added. “Behind the scenes, they believe in an independent judiciary and they don’t want Trump messing with it.”\n\nFormer Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) said Trump’s attack on the judge puts Republican lawmakers in a difficult position.\n\n“When you arbitrarily try to cancel the rule of law, which is what Trump is trying to do, and lead by the edict of an individual, whether he is president or not, you’re creating almost a banana republic-type of event,” he warned.\n\n“The fact that members of the Republican Party would introduce articles of impeachment [against the judge] is an inexcusable abrogation of their obligation as members of the Congress,” he said.\n\n“How does it affect Republicans? Significantly. Because even though senior Republicans in the Senate may disagree and hopefully would disagree strongly, it’s the president who’s head of the party and is defining the party,” Gregg warned. “If you’re running as a Republican against a Democrat, or anybody else, you’re going to be painted with the brush that you don’t think the rule of law should apply in America anymore.”\n\nThe Justice Department on Tuesday complied with Boasberg’s order for sworn statements acknowledging that the deported Venezuelan migrants, allegedly members of the Tren de Aragua gang, arrived in El Salvador after the judge issued verbal and written orders to stop the deportations.\n\nThe judge asked Justice Department officials to explain why two deportation flights continued on from Honduras to El Salvador after he issued his orders.\n\nThe Trump administration’s lawyers argued Monday that Boasberg’s order wasn’t violated because the judge does not have the jurisdiction to overrule the president’s powers as commander in chief.\n\nTwo prominent Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee rallied to Trump’s defense.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on Sunday accused Boasberg of “unilaterally deciding policy for the whole country” and vowed to investigate.\n\n“This time to benefit foreign gang members,” he posted on the social platform X, referring to the court order. “If the Supreme Court or Congress doesn’t fix, we’re headed toward a constitutional crisis.\n\n“Senate Judiciary Cmte taking action,” he added.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), another member of the Judiciary Committee, posted on X that “Democrats would rather defend known terrorists and cartel gangsters than let President Trump do his job of keeping our country safe.”\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc.

        "full_text": "President Donald Trump is deporting immigrants -- 11,000 last month.\n\nSome people are unhappy about that.\n\nLast week, a judge ordered a stop to Trump's removal of Venezuelan nationals. (Deportation happened anyway.)\n\nI definitely want immigrant criminals deported.\n\nTrump says migrant crime is \"happening at levels that nobody thought possible!\"\n\nBut that's not true.\n\nResearching my new video, I learned that immigrants are actually less likely to get into trouble than native-born Americans.\n\nTexas, the only state that tracks immigrant crime, compares convictions per 100,000 Americans. Score: illegal immigrants, 782; legal immigrants, 535; native-born Americans, 1,422. It's the opposite of what most of us have heard.\n\nBut even if immigrants are less likely to commit crimes, there are other reasons to object to immigration:\n\n1) Immigrants take jobs away from Americans.\n\n2) They freeload off our welfare system.\n\n3) They threaten our culture.\n\nI'll take them point-by-point.\n\nTucker Carlson complains, \"These new rivals compete primarily with the very Americans most likely to have lost their jobs.\"\n\nHe's right. Migrants take jobs from some Americans, and some Americans are out of work. But unemployment is relatively low: 4.1%. It was 8.8% when I was first hired by ABC.\n\nToday, companies complain that they can't find enough people willing to show up on time and work.\n\nIn addition, \"Every serious economic study,\" says Yaron Brook of the Ayn Rand Institute, shows immigrants \"create more jobs than they destroy.You might lose your job, but you live now in a society that has ... more opportunities because many immigrants are entrepreneurs.\"\n\nThey sure are. Immigrants started Space X, eBay, Instacart, Uber, NVIDIA, SanDisk, etc.\n\n\"We benefit enormously from our interaction with immigrants,\" says Brook. \"Who has the right to stop us from that interaction?! ... It's like saying: 'I have a right to stagnate and to force all of you to stagnate with me.'\"\n\nWhat about the second point? Immigrants freeloading off welfare? Illegal immigrants actually don't qualify for most benefits, but some politicians give tax money away anyway. Some give migrants credit cards. Also, immigrants' kids often attend public schools, hospitals treat them for free (seems cruel not to) and they benefit from public services available to everyone in America.\n\n\"The way to deal with that is not to restrict immigration,\" says Brook. \"Deal with that by restricting the goodies.\"\n\nWhy not restrict immigration?\n\n\"Immigrants are a massive benefit to Americans,\" he says.\n\nIt's true.\n\nTrump says, \"Legal immigration. I like it. We need people.\"\n\nBut even illegal immigrants are a net gain. Not just because they harvest our food, do construction, etc., but also because Social Security and Medicare taxes are deducted from their paychecks. That's money they never get back, because they're not legal.\n\nAs a result, undocumented immigrants pay more into our economy than they get back.\n\nSome Americans say, \"I support immigration, but migrants should get in line and obey the laws.\"\n\nBut for most migrants, that's almost impossible.\n\nUnder our current rules, many would have to wait more than 100 years!\n\n\"Legal immigration is unbelievably complicated,\" says Brook. \"It's almost impossible to come here.\"\n\nTrump proposes selling a type of green card for $5 million.\n\nMaybe that's a good idea.\n\nBrook says, \"Let in anyone with a job offer.\" That's a good idea.\n\nBut then there's concern number three: \"We are bringing in peasant cultures,\" complains pundit Ann Coulter.\n\nBrook replies, \"There are good people in every culture. When (the) Irish came, they were accused of being barbarians. Every wave of immigrants has been accused of the same thing. The fact is ... they assimilate quite well, no matter where they come from.\"\n\nI push back, \"Some are Muslim fundamentalists who bring in ideas we don't like. Some are socialists.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Brook answers, \"But if we are confident in the ideas that we have, individual rights ... capitalism and liberty, we should fight for those ideas. It's Americans who teach at our universities that the Founding Fathers were terrible human beings.\"\n\nBy contrast, most immigrants like America!\n\nLet more in.\n\nEvery Tuesday at JohnStossel.com, Stossel posts a new video about the battle between government and freedom.",

He said the Russian leader had in effect rejected a comprehensive ceasefire in his call on Tuesday with US President Donald Trump.\n\nPutin told Trump a full ceasefire would only work if Ukraine's allies stopped giving military assistance - a condition Ukraine's European allies have previously rejected.\n\nOfficials in the southern Russian region of Krasnodar said that a Ukrainian drone attack sparked a small fire at an oil depot.\n\nWithin hours of Putin agreeing to halt attacks on energy infrastructure, Zelensky said there had been \"hits, specifically on civilian infrastructure\", including a hospital in Sumy.\n\nThe region's government posted footage of the destruction, in which smoke can be seen rising from the caved-in hospital wing. Officials have since said that there had been no casualties.\n\nZelensky said that Russia launched more than 40 drones against Ukraine in the hours following the call between Trump and Putin.\n\n\"It is these types of night-time attacks by Russia that destroy our energy sector, our infrastructure, and the normal life of Ukrainians,\" Zelensky said.\n\n\"Today, Putin effectively rejected the proposal for a full ceasefire.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian president also confirmed that a call would take place between him and Trump on Wednesday, but gave no further details.\n\nMeanwhile, the Russian defence ministry said of the 57 Ukrainian drones it intercepted and destroyed overnight, 35 were over the Kursk border region.\n\nIn Belgorod, a Russian region on the border with Ukraine, the governor said the situation \"remains difficult\". Moscow said on Tuesday that Ukrainian forces attempted a ground assault on Belgorod but were pushed back.\n\nThe two countries also carried out their latest prisoner exchange on Wednesday, involving the release of 175 prisoners of war each. Zelensky said an additional 22 \"severely wounded\" Ukrainian soldiers were also freed.\n\nPutin rejected an immediate and full ceasefire in Ukraine, agreeing only to halt attacks on energy infrastructure, following a much-anticipated call with Trump.\n\nThe Russian leader declined to sign up to the comprehensive month-long ceasefire that Trump's team recently worked out with Ukrainians in Saudi Arabia.\n\nBut Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia and the US will agree either today or on Thursday the dates and attendees of their next meeting.\n\nUS talks on Ukraine are due to continue on Sunday in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the US envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, said.\n\nAbout 80% of Ukraine's energy infrastructure has been destroyed by Russian bombs, Zelensky said last September.\n\nKyiv has in turn conducted drone and missile strikes deep into Russian territory, on oil and gas facilities.",

        "full_text": "The FBI has handed over to Congress key documents related to Biden-era “weaponization” scandals at the Justice Department following a subpoena from House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan.\n\nFBI Assistant Director Marshall Yates sent a letter to Jordan on Friday vowing that “under Director Kash Patel's leadership, the FBI is dedicated to working with Congress towards transparency,” according to a copy of the letter obtained by Just the News, with the FBI official providing the House with internal bureau records tied to former Attorney General Merrick Garland’s divisive school board memorandum aimed at protesting parents.\n\nThe records also include the Richmond, Va., FBI field office’s since-retracted memo targeting Catholics, and the bureau’s controversial investigations enforcing the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act.\n\nJordan, who has long sought answers on “the weaponization of federal law enforcement against the American people” under former President Joe Biden, filed a subpoena with Patel’s FBI in late February, arguing that the bureau “refused any real transparency or accountability for its actions” during former Director Christopher Wray’s tenure and arguing that Wray had ignored several subpoenas Jordan had issued.\n\nThe Ohio Republican argued to Patel last month that “it is important that you succeed in restoring public confidence and creating much-needed transparency.” The new documents the FBI handed over may be a step in that direction.\n\n\"We are thankful for Director Patel's work, and we will have more updates soon,\" Jordan's spokesman Russell Dye told Just the News.\n\nThe FBI said in its new letter that, in response to Jordan’s subpoena related to Garland's school board memorandum, “additional documents” from the bureau were being handed over, including “the FBI summaries of the outstanding ‘EDUOFFICIALS’-tagged Guardians not previously provided to Congress due to their then-ongoing investigative status or classification.”\n\nThe FBI said that “one of these additional, now closed Guardians is classified and we will arrange delivery of this information with Committee staff at their convenience” but that “we have confirmed that there were no additional Guardians that have received the ‘EDUOFFICIALS’ threat tag since the FBI's prior productions to the Committee in August 2022.”\n\nJordan’s late February letter to Patel said that he “still has unanswered questions about how the FBI quickly operationalized” Garland’s October 2021 memo which had directed the Biden-era Justice Department and FBI to investigate alleged threats posed by outspoken parents.\n\nJordan also had remaining concerns about “whether the FBI objected to the civil liberties infringements inherent in the Attorney General’s memorandum.”\n\nJordan revealed whistleblower evidence in November 2021 which indicated that FBI counterterrorism assets were involved in the investigation of parents protesting school policies. He released an unclassified internal FBI email at the time showing that the bureau's counterterrorism chief sent instructions to FBI officials to use a \"threat tag\" to track any complaints involving parents and school officials.\n\nIn January, Attorney General Pam Bondi used a little-noticed footnote to rescind Garland’s memo.\n\nIn last Friday’s letter, the FBI said that it had also handed over a “further response to the subpoena regarding the Richmond Field Office's Domain Perspective.”\n\nJordan’s letter to the FBI in late February that the bureau had refused for two years to provide adequate answers on the FBI’s Richmond Field Office’s January 2023 memo, which linked “racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists” (RMVEs) with a “radical-traditionalist Catholic” (RTC) ideology.\n\nThe Republican chairman argued that “the Richmond memorandum resulted in federal law enforcement agents being inserted into places of worship.” Jordan said that the FBI under Wray “failed to produce information regarding open-sources, FBI case files, and liaison and local law enforcement reporting used to create the Richmond memorandum – all of which were responsive to the Committee’s subpoena.”\n\nThe FBI intelligence product released in January 2023 by the bureau’s field office in Richmond contended that links between RMVEs and RTCs “almost certainly presents opportunities for threat mitigation through the exploration of new avenues for tripwires and source development.”\n\nBut the FBI’s national press office admitted in February 2023 that “this particular field office product…does not meet the exacting standards of the FBI” and claimed that “upon learning of the document, FBI Headquarters quickly began taking action to remove the document from FBI systems and conduct a review of the basis for the document.”\n\nThe field office’s intelligence product repeatedly cited the left-wing Southern Poverty Law Center, including an article on “Radical Traditional Catholicism.”\n\nThe Richmond field office also pointed to an Atlantic article on “How Extremist Gun Culture is Trying to Co-Opt the Rosary.” And the local field office had also cited articles by Salon, including “Traditional Catholics and White Nationalist ‘Groypers’ Forge a New Far-Right Youth Movement” and “White Nationalists Get Religion.”\n\nDOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz wrote in 2024 that the FBI’s Inspection Division concluded that “there was no evidence of malicious intent or improper purpose” behind the local field office memo, but did note significant problems with it, including that it \"failed to adhere to analytic tradecraft standards and evinced errors in professional judgment, including that it lacked sufficient evidence or articulable support for a relationship between RMVEs and so-called RTC ideology; incorrectly conflated the subjects’ religious views with their RMVE activities, creating the appearance that the FBI had inappropriately considered religious beliefs and affiliation as a basis for conducting investigative activity; and reflected a lack of training and awareness concerning proper domestic terrorism terminology.”\n\nThe FBI also told Jordan on Friday that it was handing over “information regarding investigations related to the FACE Act.”\n\nThe bureau said that, since May 2022, “the FBI's counterterrorism and criminal divisions have investigated 55 acts that led to FACE Act-predicated investigations.” The bureau said that one investigation “involved a facility that provides abortion services, 31 involved a facility that provides pregnancy resources, and 23 involved a facility that provides both abortion services and pregnancy resources.”\n\nJordan’s late February letter had alleged that, under the Biden administration, “the FBI and the Justice Department implemented a double standard in enforcing the FACE Act in a way that protected anti-life activists and facilities while effectively ignoring attacks on pro-life advocates and facilities.”\n\nHe also said Wray’s FBI “utilized aggressive law enforcement tactics to go after pro-life advocates that bordered on thuggish” as he demanded more information from the bureau.\n\nThen-FBI Director Wray testified in August 2022 that the bureau had launched “domestic violent extremism investigations” into pro-abortion rights threats and attacks that increasingly targeted anti-abortion groups in the wake of the May 2022 leak of a draft of the Supreme Court’s opinion overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nPresident Donald Trump in January pardoned 23 pro-life activists who were convicted under the FACE Act.\n\nPatel and the FBI handed over an initial tranche of documents in response to Jordan’s subpoena earlier in March, as first reported by Fox News, with those records reportedly relating to Garland’s school board memo, the failed investigation into pipe bombs planted in the nation’s capital the day before the January 6th riot, the bureau's interactions with social media companies, and the now-defunct Foreign Influence Task Force.\n\n“Kash Patel’s FBI was given a mandate to open up the books and engage in transparency efforts at levels never before seen – and our Congressional Affairs team is stepping up to the plate,” FBI spokesman Ben Williamson told Just the News. “We will continue to work diligently with Chairman Jordan and Chairman Grassley to ensure the American people get the information they deserve.”",

The judge also blocked Citibank, which holds the money on behalf of EPA, from transferring it to the government or anyone else.\n\nEPA Administrator Lee Zeldin claimed the grant recipients engaged in mismanagement, fraud and self-dealing in announcing that he froze and moved to terminate the grants, but the judge said Zeldin's allegations were inadequate.\n\n\"At this juncture, EPA Defendants have not sufficiently explained why unilaterally terminating Plaintiffs’ grant awards was a rational precursor to reviewing\" the green bank program, Chutkan wrote.\n\nEPA TERMINATES BIDEN ADMIN'S GREEN GRANTS WORTH $20B, ZELDIN SAYS\n\nThe grant recipients sued the EPA, Zeldin and Citibank, arguing that they had illegally denied the groups access to $14 billion awarded last year through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, commonly referred to as a \"green bank.\" The program, which consisted of two initiatives worth $14 billion and $6 billion, respectively, was approved by Congress under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act to support clean energy and climate-friendly projects.\n\nThree groups — Climate United, the Coalition for Green Capital and Power Forward Communities — said the frozen grants prevented them from funding new projects and might force them to lay off staff. The groups said the allegations of mishandling funds were meritless.\n\nThe groups also asked Chutkan to order Citibank to unfreeze the account, but the judge declined.

        "full_text": "ANGOLA, La. (AP) — Louisiana used nitrogen gas to put a man to death Tuesday evening for a killing decades ago, marking the first time the state has used the method as it resumed executions after a 15-year hiatus.\n\nJessie Hoffman Jr., 46, was pronounced dead at 6:50 p.m. at the Louisiana State Penitentiary, authorities said, adding the nitrogen gas had flowed for 19 minutes during what one official characterized as a “flawless” execution.\n\nWitnesses to the execution said Hoffman appeared to involuntarily shake or had “some convulsive activity.” But the three witnesses who spoke — including two members of the media — agreed that, based on the protocol and what they learned about the execution method, nothing seemed out of the ordinary.\n\nWitness Gina Swanson, a reporter with WDSU, described the execution from her viewpoint as “clinical” and “procedural.” She said there was nothing that occurred during the process that made her think, “Was that right? Was that how it was supposed to go?”\n\nHoffman declined to make a final statement in the execution chamber. He also declined a final meal.\n\nIt was the fifth time nitrogen gas was used in the U.S. after four executions by the same method — all in Alabama. Three other executions, by lethal injection, are scheduled this week — in Arizona on Wednesday and in Florida and Oklahoma on Thursday.\n\nHoffman convicted of New Orleans murder\n\nHoffman was convicted of the murder of Mary “Molly” Elliott, a 28-year-old advertising executive who was killed in New Orleans. At the time of the crime, Hoffman was 18 and has since spent much of his adult life at the penitentiary in rural southeast Louisiana, where he was executed Tuesday evening.\n\nAfter court battles earlier this month, attorneys for Hoffman had turned to the Supreme Court in last-ditch hopes of halting the execution. Last year, the court declined to intervene in the nation’s first nitrogen hypoxia execution, in Alabama.\n\nHoffman’s lawyers had unsuccessfully argued that the nitrogen gas procedure — which deprives a person of oxygen — violates the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. The man’s lawyers, in a last-ditch appeal, also argued the method would infringe on Hoffman’s freedom to practice religion, specifically his Buddhist breathing and meditation in the moments leading up to death.\n\nLouisiana officials maintained the method is painless. They also said it was past time for the state to deliver justice as promised to victims’ families after a decade and a half hiatus — one brought on partly by an inability to secure lethal injection drugs.\n\nThe Supreme Court voted 5-4 in declining to step in.\n\nHours earlier at a hearing Tuesday, a 19th Judicial District Court Judge Richard “Chip” Moore also declined to stop the execution. He agreed with the state’s lawyers who had argued the man’s religion-based arguments fell under the jurisdiction of a federal judge who had already ruled on them, according to local news outlets.\n\nExecution method deprives body of oxygen\n\nUnder the Louisiana protocol, which is nearly identical to Alabama’s, officials had earlier said Hoffman would be strapped to a gurney before a full-face respirator mask fitted tightly on him. Pure nitrogen gas was then pumped into the mask, forcing him to breathe it in and depriving him of the oxygen needed to maintain bodily functions.\n\nThe protocol called for the gas to be administered for at least 15 minutes or five minutes after the inmate’s heart rate reaches a flatline indication on the EKG, whichever is longer.\n\nTwo media witnesses to Tuesday’s execution said Hoffman was covered with a gray plush blanket from the neck down. In the chamber with Hoffman was his spiritual adviser. Ahead of the execution and after the curtains closed to the viewing room, witnesses said they could hear Buddhist chanting.\n\nThe gas began to flow at 6:21 p.m. and Hoffman started twitching, media witnesses said. His hands clenched and he had a “slight head movement.” Swanson said she closely watched the blanket over Hoffman’s chest area and could see it rise and fall, indicating that he was breathing. She said his last visible breath appeared to be at 6:37 p.m. Shortly after, the curtains between the chamber and witness viewing room closed. When they reopened, Hoffman was pronounced dead.\n\nSeth Smith, chief of operations at the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections, witnessed the execution and also acknowledged Hoffman’s movements. Smith, who has a medical background, said he perceived the convulsions to be an “involuntary response to dying” and that Hoffman appeared to be unconscious at the time.\n\nNitrogen gas was first used in Alabama\n\nEach inmate put to death using nitrogen in Alabama had appeared to shake and gasp to varying degrees during their executions, according to media witnesses, including an Associated Press reporter. Alabama state officials said the reactions were involuntary movements associated with oxygen deprivation.\n\nAlabama first used nitrogen gas to put Kenneth Eugene Smith to death last year, marking the first time a new method had been used in the U.S. since lethal injection was introduced in 1982.\n\nAlabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma specifically authorize execution by nitrogen hypoxia, according to records compiled by the Death Penalty Information Center. Arkansas was added to the list on Tuesday.\n\nSeeking to resume executions, Louisiana’s GOP-dominated Legislature expanded the state’s approved death penalty methods last year to include nitrogen hypoxia and electrocution. Lethal injection was already in place.\n\nOn Tuesday, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed legislation allowing executions using nitrogen gas, making hers the fifth state to adopt the method. Arkansas currently has 25 people on death row.\n\nOver recent decades, the number of executions nationally has declined sharply amid legal battles, a shortage of lethal injection drugs and waning public support for capital punishment. That has led a majority of states to either abolish or pause carrying out the death penalty.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, a small group of execution opponents held a vigil outside the rural southeast Louisiana prison at Angola, where the state’s executions are carried out. Some passed out prayer cards with photos of a smiling Hoffman and planned a Buddhist reading and “Meditation for Peace.”\n\nLouisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said she expects at least four people to be executed this year in the state. Following Hoffman’s execution, she said justice had been delayed for far too long and now Hoffman ”faces the ultimate judgment, the judgment before God.”",

        "full_text": "The Trump administration has admitted in federal court documents that “many” Venezuelans it accused of being dangerous gang members and deported through presidential wartime powers have no criminal records in the United States, but argued it was only because they had only been in the U.S. briefly.\n\nPresident Donald Trump used a centuries-old law, the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, to deport the Venezuelans without due process in the U.S., saying they were members of the feared Tren de Aragua gang.\n\n“The lack of criminal records does not indicate they pose a limited threat. In fact, based upon their association with Tren de Aragua, the lack of specific information about each specific individual actually highlights the risk they pose,” said Robert Cerna, a top Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, in a sworn statement filed Monday night to a the U.S. District Court in Washington D.C.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump sent these Venezuelans to El Salvador mega prison. Their families deny gang ties.\n\nCerna’s statement and other court documents offer critical insight into how the federal government justifies which Venezuelans to send to a mega prison in El Salvador as part of a deal the Trump administration brokered with President Nayib Bukele last month. Bukele said they would remain in prison for at least a year.\n\nThe move has ignited widespread alarm over the extent of Trump’s executive authority and due process violations. The White House has argued that the deportations were justified in the name of public safety.\n\nCerna’s statement is part of a lawsuit challenging an executive order in which Trump directed his administration to use the wartime powers to deport Venezuelan citizens over 14 years old if they are Tren de Aragua members. Cerna is the Acting Field Office Director of Enforcement and Removal Operations for ICE in Harlingen, Texas.\n\nOver the weekend, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., ordered the deportations blocked, telling the administration during a hearing to bring back any planes already in the air carrying deportees. The Trump administration sent more than 200 Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador anyway, raising questions about whether the White House violated the court ruling. The Justice Department has denied the government defied U.S. District Judge James Boasberg’s written orders.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump deports hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members. Did he defy a court order?\n\nCerna said the lack of information the government has on the deported Venezuelans “demonstrates that they are terrorists with regard to whom we lack a complete file.” Neither Cerna nor the federal government has released any evidence publicly on the criminal and personal history of the deported Venezuelans. The ICE official described how the agency had determined their personal and criminal backgrounds and shared details of charges, arrests, and convictions without identifying specific people.\n\nHe indicated that ICE databases showed that “numerous” individuals had been arrested during federal gang operations or had criminal histories in the U.S. That includes allegations of murder for one individual as well as arrests and charges for aggravated assault with a weapon, drug possession, and sex crimes. He also said several of the individuals had been under investigation for kidnapping, drug trafficking, murder, and other serious crimes in Venezuela and elsewhere.\n\nICE “carefully vetted” the individuals through court records, surveillance, law enforcement encounters, interviews, victim testimonies, criminal evidence members, financial transactions, computer checks, and confessions of membership, Cerna said. He said the agency did not rely solely on social media, photos of gang gestures and tattoos to link people to the Tren de Aragua gang.\n\nU.S. authorities have linked some tattoos to Tren de Aragua, but experts say that Tren de Aragua members don’t have any specific tattoos tied to affiliation.\n\nAttorneys and immigration advocates say that the invocation of the Alien Enemies Act is unlawful and that the Venezuelans were entitled to due process and the opportunity to show a judge that they do not belong to Tren de Aragua.\n\nFamilies of three men who appear to have been deported and imprisoned in El Salvador told the Miami Herald that their relatives have no gang affiliation – and two said their relatives had never been charged with a crime in the U.S. or elsewhere. One has been previously accused by the U.S. government of ties to the Tren de Aragua gang, but his family denies any connection.\n\nHeated court proceedings\n\nOn Monday Judge Boasberg asked the administration for more details about the deportation flights during a hearing on Monday. The Justice Department did not answer questions, citing national security.\n\nCerna claimed in another sworn statement that the passengers on a third flight to El Salvador had final orders of removal and had not been solely deported under the wartime authority.\n\nREAD MORE: Judge orders DOJ lawyers to justify secrecy around El Salvador deportations: reports\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump called Boesberg “a radical left lunatic of a judge, a troublemaker, and an agitator” on social media. He called for the long-time federal judge’s impeachment, prompting an extraordinary admonishment from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nIn a statement, the chief justice said that “for more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.” Roberts, who was appointed to the high court by President George W. Bush, said “the normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.”\n\nLawyers and experts have warned that Trump’s public lashing of Boesberg and his potential defiance of the court order constitute an attack on checks and balances, a key tenet of American democracy that keeps the three branches of government accountable to each other.\n\n“The Trump administration’s decisions this weekend are part and parcel of a campaign of mass deportation and evisceration of rule of law,” said Hannah Flamm, an attorney and acting senior policy director at the International Refugee Assistance Project, a New York-based legal aid and advocacy group.\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act has only been used three times before, all during times of war. The last time it was used led to the internment of Japanese immigrants and Americans of Japanese descent in U.S. camps during World War II.\n\nThis story was originally published March 18, 2025 at 7:52 PM.",

        "full_text": "Mark Rober is perhaps the most successful science and engineering YouTube creator.\n\nHe has 65 million subscribers — more than Taylor Swift — and many of his videos have over 120 million views, surpassing the most recent Super Bowl.\n\nRober’s most recent release compares a Tesla dealing with various road issues with a test car with a Luminar LIDAR. He tests how both cars react to a dummy child in the road obscured by fog, water jets, bright lights and even a giant printed poster showing an empty road, as sometimes seen in the Road Runner cartoons.\n\nThe goal of the test is to compare the performance of the Tesla, which uses only cameras and computer vision, and the LIDAR based system, which uses an advanced scanning laser to create a 3-D view of the road ahead of the car. All working self-driving car systems operating on roads without a human supervisor use LIDAR, radar, cameras, vision, and sometimes more. Tesla, and some startups, are trying to work with just vision.\n\nSadly, Rober’s large effort here is almost entirely wasted, because while the title of the video says it is a “self-driving car” test, he uses an un-named version of Tesla’s “Autopilot” system, which is its older freeway driver-assist tool.\n\nIt is odd to find myself so critical. My 2013 “Cameras vs. Lasers” article, while getting long in the tooth, was one of the pioneering articles on this question, and I’ve always come down pretty strongly on the LIDAR side, and I’ve been a very frequent critic of Tesla’s decision to use only vision. Rober had a great chance to show the reality of this, but dropped the ball.\n\nNobody ever considered Autopilot to be a self-driving system. It is more like a fancy cruise control and it frequently makes mistakes and needs a driver attentive to the road with hands on the wheel to keep it safe. Tesla moved beyond that system several years ago and now markets a system called “supervised full self driving.”\n\nIn spite of that seemingly explicit name, it also is not a self-driving system and needs supervision, though Tesla has for many years claimed it would become a self-driving system “next year,” without success. Most recently, it was announced it would operate unsupervised in June in Austin, Texas, though few believe this promise will be delivered on in a meaningful way.\n\nNonetheless, the new FSD system, which only works on Tesla’s latest hardware, found in cars released starting in 2023, is significantly different from the old FSD system. And that is quite different from the old Autopilot, too.\n\nThe newer Autopilot is derived from the FSD system, but still fairly different. Frankly, few are interested in tests on the old Autopilot, so that makes Rober’s tests fairly meaningless, even if it is the case that the newest FSD system would have made the same errors — we unfortunately don’t know.\n\nWhile Rober may not have known about the software versions available for his car, the crew at Luminar, the LIDAR company that assisted with the tests, provided the LIDAR car and system. As it has done these tests before, the company would surely have been aware of them and should have informed Rober.\n\nThe tests performed were designed to highlight the difference between computer vision and LIDAR. The LIDAR car performed them all, while the Autopilot system failed in thick fog, very heavy water jets and the Road Runner cartoon-like photographic wall. The Tesla also failed with Autopilot off, leaving just its forward collision avoidance system. The FCA system is designed to delay braking to give the driver a chance to brake first, as such it stopped too late.\n\nUpdate: Online critics have pointed out a number of concerning inconsistencies in the video and a “raw” clip provided by Rober. Further, it seems that the appearance of the cartoon pattern in the brick wallpaper before he hits it indicates it was hit before and reconstructed for the the take which was shown. They are also pointing out Rober seems to disengage the Autopilot system a short time before hitting the wall. While he should have taken steps to avoid that, it doesn’t alter the result of the test much, as the system, if it had detected the wall, should have been braking long before his disengagement. At most the disengagement modestly increased the speed of hitting the wall.\n\nWhat’s a good test?\n\nAnother problem with Rober’s tests is that the ones where the vision system failed do not model the real world well. While all teams test their vehicles in fog and rain and in the face of bright lights, they generally do not demand success for conditions which do not appear in the real world, and which a human could not handle. They do test these to see how they could improve the systems, but real testing of self-driving cars involves millions of miles and a very broad array of challenges on which the system is hoped to surpass human performance.\n\nThe fake wall was a billboard sized canvas printed with a photograph of the empty road beyond the wall. Those are rarely seen in the wild outside of certain regions of New Mexico. Self-driving teams are interested in potential adversarial attacks on cars and how to defend against them, but this is not a likely one; there are simpler and cheaper techniques. It’s more in line with the fun that Rober’s viewers enjoy in his videos than a real test. A visual image is of course something that will foil cameras and not adversely affect radars or LIDARs.\n\nAll successful self-driving teams, who have managed to deploy a vehicle with no human inside, use a combination of cameras, radars and LIDAR.\n\nThe vision only approach is used only by Tesla and some smaller startups, and none have made a working self-driving car, or even come close to it, as of yet, though they have hope for the future. Indeed, most experts think that approach may well work in the future, but just when is unknown. For now, they feel that making use of all sensors is important to get the vehicles working, and later work can be done to make things cheaper, including going to just vision if and when that becomes practical.\n\nAs such, a demonstration of the abilities of LIDAR and the problems vision can have makes sense. Tesla’s latest FSD probably would have failed some of these tests, but it was not tested so Rober’s video leaves us without the information we actually might seek. Rober has not, as yet, responded to a request for more information.\n\nThe problems shown are not the most important and difficult problems for computer vision to solve, however. It’s biggest problem is attaining the extremely high reliability level needed to bet your life, not specific hazards like fog or rain or clever coyotes.\n\nThe Luminar LIDAR performs well. Some LIDARS might have issues with some of the challenges presented, including opaque fog and extremely heavy rain. None would have an issue with the photograph wall. Luminar’s LIDAR uses long-wave infrared, which allows much more power and range. Waymo has a similar instrument of their own construction on their vehicles. (I worked in a minor way with the team which developed it.)\n\nWe might hope Rober would re-do his test with Tesla’s latest software and hardware, and also come up with more real-world situations to tell the real story.",

        "full_text": "A federal judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked the U.S. military from enforcing President Donald Trump's executive order barring transgender people from military service while a lawsuit by 20 current and would-be service members challenging the measure goes forward.\n\nU.S. District Judge Ana Reyes in Washington found that Trump's January 27 order, one of a several issued by the Republican president impacting legal rights for transgender Americans, likely violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition on sex discrimination.\n\nReyes was appointed by President Joe Biden, Trump's Democrat predecessor.\n\nIn response to Trump's order, the military said on Feb. 11 that it would no longer allow transgender individuals to join the military and would stop performing or facilitating procedures associated with gender transition for service members. Later that month, the military said it would begin expelling transgender members.\n\nTrump said in his order that \"adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual's sex conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life.\"\n\nTrump issued a similar order during his first term, during which already-serving transgender members were allowed to remain.\n\nPlaintiffs in the lawsuit argued that the order was illegal, pointing to a 2020 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that employment discrimination against transgender people is a form of illegal sex discrimination.\n\nLawyers for the government have argued in court that the military is entitled to bar people with certain conditions that make them unsuitable for service, also including bipolar disorder and eating disorders. At a March 12 hearing, they told Reyes that she should defer to the judgment of the current administration that transgender people are not fit for service.\n\nThe judge repeatedly pressed them to justify their stance with evidence, and at times expressed open outrage at the order's language denigrating the character of transgender people.\n\nThe military has about 1.3 million active-duty personnel, Department of Defense data shows. While transgender rights advocates say there are as many as 15,000 transgender service members, officials say the number is in the low thousands.",

        "full_text": "The Supreme Court in a 5-4 vote declined to stop Louisiana from carrying out its first execution in 15 years later Tuesday with Justice Neil Gorsuch joining the court’s three liberal justices in agreeing to delay it.\n\nJessie Hoffman, 46, is set to be executed for the 1996 kidnapping, rape and murder of Molly Elliott, making Louisiana the second state to carry out an execution by nitrogen gas. The Supreme Court has also declined to step in since Alabama began employing the method last year.\n\nFive of the court’s conservatives — Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — refused Hoffman’s final appeal to delay his execution without comment.\n\nThe three liberal justices dissented in that decision, joined by Gorsuch, President Trump’s first appointee to the court.\n\nThough the liberal justices did not explain their reasoning, Gorsuch in a written dissent said he would’ve sent the case back to a lower court for another look at Hoffman’s claims that Louisiana’s nitrogen hypoxia method substantially burdens his right to practice his Buddhist faith under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) of 2000.\n\nHoffman noted in his application that meditative breathing at the time of death carries profound spiritual significance in the Buddhist tradition. Gorsuch said a lower court was wrong to make its own finding “about the kind of breathing Mr. Hoffman’s faith requires” in rejecting his claims.\n\n“The Court of Appeals failed to confront the district court’s apparent legal error — or even to mention the RLUIPA claim Mr. Hoffman pressed on appeal. Perhaps that claim ultimately lacks merit. But the Fifth Circuit’s unexplained omission leaves this Court poorly positioned to assess it,” Gorsuch wrote.\n\nThe Supreme Court rarely intervenes on an emergency basis to stop executions, having already denied several requests since the start of the year.\n\nIn court filings, the Louisiana attorney general’s office insisted Hoffman had improperly waited until the last minute to file the appeal and the state wasn’t violating his protected rights.\n\n“Plaintiff has never argued that there is a legally appreciable difference between his breathing as he fades into unconsciousness by nitrogen hypoxia and his breathing as he would fade into unconsciousness after being shot by a firing squad,” the state attorney general’s office wrote in court filings.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc.

        "full_text": "A French politician facetiously asked the U.S. to return the Statue of Liberty, suggesting the country no longer lives up to the values the green-hued gift represents.\n\nRaphaël Glucksmann, a member of the European Parliament with the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, said at a party convention on Sunday that he had a message \"to the Americans who have chosen to side with the tyrants … who fired researchers for demanding scientific freedom.\"\n\n\"Give us back the Statue of Liberty,\" he said with a smile as the crowd cheered. \"We gave it to you as a gift, but apparently you despise it. So it will be just fine here at home.\"\n\nLady Liberty — full name \"Liberty Enlightening the World\" — was conceptualized by French anti-slavery activist Édouard de Laboulaye in 1865 to honor the centennial of the U.S. Declaration of Independence and its friendship with France, whose support helped win the American Revolution.\n\nAfter years of construction, shipping and assembly, the statue was officially unveiled in 1886 in New York Harbor, where its raised torch and inscribed words of welcome greeted the millions of immigrants who arrived at Ellis Island in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nIt has endured as a global symbol of freedom, patriotism and democracy — and the lack thereof — in the decades since.\n\n\"Ordinary people, from American suffragists in the 1800s and 1900s to Chinese students in the 1980s, have raised up the Statue's likeness to call for greater equality, an end to injustice, and more enlightened societies,\" says the National Park Service (NPS), which maintains the site.\n\nGlucksmann's comments come at a time when the U.S. has been criticized at home and abroad for abandoning some of those commitments, including by cracking down on immigration and alienating European allies. Glucksmann has been a vocal critic of President Trump's decision to temporarily suspend aid to Ukraine as it defends itself from Russia.\n\nWhen asked about Glucksmann's request — which he has since confirmed was symbolic — at a Monday briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"And my advice to that unnamed, low-level French politician would be to remind them that it's only because of the United States of America that the French are not speaking German right now, so they should be very grateful to our great country,\" Leavitt added — an apparent reference to the U.S. role, alongside other allied nations, in liberating France from Nazi occupation in World War II.\n\nNo one is actually taking the statue back\n\nGlucksmann responded in a 10-part thread on X addressed to the American people, acknowledging, \"I would simply not be here if hundreds of thousands of young Americans had not landed on our beaches in Normandy.\"\n\nBut, he said, that was a different version of America — one that \"fought against tyrants, it did not flatter them;\" one that \"welcomed the persecuted and didn't target them.\"\n\n\"It was far, so far from what your current President does, says, and embodies,\" he wrote.\n\nHe specifically cited the Trump administration's \"betrayal of Ukraine and Europe,\" as well as its treatment of scientists. Notably: One French university recently launched an initiative to welcome American scientists whose work is untenable due to the administration's research cuts.\n\nGlucksmann said his comments were meant as \"a wake up call.\"\n\n\"No one, of course, will come and steal the Statue of Liberty,\" he wrote. \"The statue is yours. But what it embodies belongs to everyone. And if the free world no longer interests your government, then we will take up the torch, here in Europe.\"\n\nThe Statue of Liberty would be hard for France to recall, since it is owned by the U.S. government, according to UNESCO. It's also a national monument and major tourist attraction, drawing 3 million visitors in 2023 alone.\n\nThe U.S. had to work for the gift\n\nWhile the Statue of Liberty was a gift, its creators believed the project should be a joint effort: The French paid for the statue, while the U.S. paid for its pedestal.\n\nThat involved a massive fundraising effort in both countries, through advertising, public events and souvenir sales.\n\n\"Though wealthy individuals did contribute, it was the small donations of hundreds of thousands of working people and children on both sides of the Atlantic that made the Statue of Liberty a reality,\" the NPS says.\n\nFrench sculptor Frédéric-Auguste Bartholdi led the design and construction of the statue's copper components — from crown to gown — over several years, while working with American architect Richard Morris Hunt to design the 154-foot pedestal.\n\nThe 151-foot statue was assembled in France by 1884 and presented to the U.S. minister to France that same year. Then came the challenge of actually bringing it stateside.\n\nBartholdi had selected Bedloe's Island — now called Liberty Island — in New York as the site for the statue, since it was visible to every ship entering New York Harbor. But to get there, the statue had to be disassembled into 350 pieces, transported on a French navy ship and reassembled — by a construction crew largely made up of new immigrants, according to the NPS.\n\nThe statue was finally unveiled on a rainy day in October 1886, as 1 million New Yorkers watched and cheered.\n\n\"When it was time for Bartholdi to release the tricolor French flag that veiled Liberty's face, a roar of guns, whistles, and applause sounded,\" the NPS says.\n\nA bronze plaque inscribed with \"The New Colossus\" — a poem by Jewish-American poet and activist Emma Lazarus — was added to the pedestal in 1903, memorializing the famous phrase: \"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\"\n\nThe statue's symbolism and likeness have stretched far beyond New York in the years since. Replicas can be found around the world, and have even been traded by the U.S. and France.\n\nFrench people living in the U.S. sent a replica to their homeland in 1889 for the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. The statue was placed on an artificial island in the River Seine in Paris, originally facing the French presidential palace. It turned to face its American sister in New York in 1937.",

But then the bank got to the point.\n\n“We know this is a difficult time, and we’re here to help,” the bank wrote. “We received a request from Social Security Administration to return benefits paid to LEONARD A. JOHNSON’s account after their passing.”\n\n“There’s nothing you need to do — we’ve deducted the funds from LEONARD A. JOHNSON’s account.”\n\nUh oh. It itemized how $5,201 had been stricken from their bank account, on the grounds that Ned wasn’t justified to get those benefits — because he was dead. That was for payments he’d received in December and January.\n\nNed found that his February Social Security check hadn’t been paid, and he’s yet to receive his March check, either. His Medicare insurance had been canceled. He also learned that when you die, your credit score gets marked as “deceased, do not issue credit,” which makes it tough to get a loan.\n\n“The good news is I don’t think it can go any lower than that,” he said cheerfully.\n\nHe called the bank first, and they said an electronic notification had been triggered on Feb. 18 that he had died back in November. But I’m on the phone with you right now, he told them. Also, what did I die of? Take it up with Social Security, they said.\n\nWhat followed was a nearly three-week battle to resurrect himself. He called Social Security two or three times a day for two weeks, with each call put on hold and then eventually disconnected. Finally someone answered and gave him an appointment for March 13. Then he got a call delaying that to March 24.\n\nIn a huff, he went to the office on the ninth floor of the Henry Jackson Federal Building downtown. It’s one of the buildings proposed to be closed under what the AP called “a frenetic and error-riddled push by Elon Musk’s budget-cutting advisers.”\n\nIt was like a Depression-era scene, he said, with a queue 50-deep jockeying for the attentions of two tellers. The employees were kind but beleaguered.\n\n“They are so understaffed down there,” he said. “They think the office is about to be closed down, and they don’t know where they’re going to go. It feels like the agency’s being gutted.”\n\nAfter waiting for four hours, Johnson admits he jumped the line: “I saw an opening and I kind of rushed up and told them I was listed as dead. That seemed to get their attention.”\n\nOnce in front of a human, Johnson said he was able to quickly prove he was alive, using his passport and his gift of gab. They pledged to fix his predicament, and on Thursday this past week, the bank called to say it had returned the deducted deposits to his account. As of Friday morning he hadn’t received February or March’s benefits payments.\n\n“When I was in that line, I was thinking that if I was living solely off Social Security, I could be close to dumpster diving about now,” he said.\n\nWhat’s concerning is that no one has been able to tell him how he ended up in the agency’s “death master file.” Had he been conflated with some other poor Leonard Johnson? Was he flagged as dead by a credit agency or the electronic funds transfer system, which then ricocheted back to Social Security? Was it simple input error? Nobody knows. Or nobody’s saying.\n\nSocial Security blandly labels this sort of event an “erroneous death determination.”\n\nJohnson said his takeaway is that Social Security needs help — with its databases, but especially with enough staffing to answer the phones. The announced plan from the new administration is to cut 7,000 employees. This past week, the news outlet ProPublica reported on a recording of a meeting in which the director, a Trump appointee, suggested ominously that DOGE’s suggested changes could cause the agency to collapse.\n\nThe director also debunked the idea that dead people are being used to fraudulently claim benefits in any widespread manner — as both Musk and Trump keep claiming.\n\nThere are 110-year-old and older people in one of databases, the director said, but those people are “not in pay status — they’re not actually being paid benefits. These are records we never bothered with.”\n\nFor his part, Johnson says he felt the agency was super-aggressive in the opposite direction. Money was unilaterally deducted from his bank account before he even had a chance to react to the news of his untimely death. People living check to check could be decimated, he said.\n\n“I’m OK with mistakes being made,” he said. “But I’m not sure how much they’re focused on fixing these kinds of mistakes going forward, as they are in using the mistakes to tear the place down.”\n\nSaid his wife Pam: “You sort of have no choice but to laugh it off. But it seems like it’s going to get worse.”\n\nFor now, Ned Johnson is hopeful he has a new lease on life. But does he?\n\nAgents cautioned him that once you’re tagged as dead in the electronic morgue, it floats in the ether and can haunt you again. It’s like there’s a ghost in the machine.\n\nSure enough, after I met Johnson on Friday and verified he was a live human being, I went home and Googled him. One of those people-search sites popped up with a listing at his address.\n\n“Leonard A. Johnson, Seattle, WA,” it read. “Deceased.”\n\nThe opinions expressed in reader comments are those of the author only and do not reflect the opinions of The Seattle Times.",

        "full_text": "D.C.\n\nThe women behind The Conservateur. Photo collage: Courtesy of The Conservateur\n\nThe Conservateur — a D.C.-based lifestyle site that positions itself as the Vogue for conservatives — is part of a new wave of young women carving out their own lanes in right-wing media.\n\nWhy it matters: The conservative media world has traditionally been dominated by the Roger Aileses and Rush Limbaughs of the world — or, simply put, older dudes. And now that's changing.\n\nThe big picture: Young people are veering further right, a trend that helped get President Trump back into the Executive Manse and is being fueled in part by Gen Z-coded, conservative-leaning influencers and platforms.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump performed slightly better with women in this election than he did in 2020.\n\nState of play: The Conserveatur gained over 40,000 Instagram followers in the three days following Trump's election, says Jayme Franklin, a Fox News and Trump White House alum who co-founded the site and runs it alongside three other women.\n\nThe site bills itself as a lifestyle platform, not a news outlet: Articles include tips on how to decorate for Christmas like a First Lady, a piece on Lara Trump's new fitness line, profiles of White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Fox News host Ainsley Earhardt, and a behind-the-scenes look at Cooper's Nashville wedding.\n\nBy the numbers: The Conservateur saw 1.7 million page views last year, says Franklin, and the women fund it themselves, bringing in revenue from subscriptions and by selling merch.\n\nAnd, of course, there's a little lib-owning: One meme shared on the platform's Instagram shows Barron Trump holding his hand up to his ear with overlaid text reading, \"When I refresh ICE's live deportation tracker.\"\n\nHow it started: Franklin and her co-founder, Isabelle Redfield, launched the Conservateur in 2020 as an antidote to what they saw as the overt wokeism within traditional mags like Marie Claire or Cosmopolitan.\n\nWhat they're saying: After Trump claimed the popular vote last year, it's now no longer \"taboo\" to be considered a conservative, says Downey: \"You couldn't really question the fact that more than half the country is now on board with this, and you can't say they're all crazy.\"\n\nThe intrigue: Franklin tells Axios several things have led to this vibe shift.\n\nFirst, libs lost cachet with former President Biden: \"The left had an opportunity in 2020 to really take advantage of culture, because [there] was a lot of energy there, especially with BLM and all that stuff,\" Franklin tells Axios. \"And then they put in this, to be quite frank, old man who just didn't inspire anyone.\"\n\nSecond, young people started to chafe against \"the progressive culture of policing everything,\" says Franklin. \"You're not allowed to say this, you can't make a joke, you'll be canceled.\"\n\nThird, some women got fed up with feminism. \"Growing up, you were sold this [narrative of] 'men are bad. Don't get married. Be your own woman. Be a career woman,''\" says Franklin.\n\nFourth, many wellness-loving women have found a gateway to the right through the MAHA movement, particularly moms concerned with their kids' food ingredients or vaccines.\n\nBetween the lines: The Conservateur's audience tends to be women ages 20-40 in left-ish metro areas who lean Christian and conservative, Franklin tells Axios. Sororities love them, too.\n\nZoom in: Things are already changing in largely liberal D.C. since Trump came back to town, says Franklin.\n\nWhat we're watching: A Conservateur podcast is in the works, say Downey and Franklin, and they'd love to feature women of the Trump administration who they believe won't get their due in mainstream media: Names floated include Kristi Noem, Pam Bondi and Linda McMahon.\n\nThe bottom line: \"We're a capitalist country at the end of the day, and capitalism caters to consumers,\" says Franklin of the tide shift. \"If Trump's the popular candidate, a lot of these brands are going to have to start catering.\"\n\nGet more local stories in your inbox with Axios Washington D.C..\n\nCopyright Axios Media, 2024",

        "full_text": "Claim:\n\nIn early March 2025, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs canceled a $56,000 contract intended for watering approximately eight plants over a five-year period.\n\nRating:\n\nMixture\n\nAbout this rating\n\nWhat's True\n\nThe VA did cancel a $56,000 contract for \"interior plant maintenance\" in early March 2025.\n\nWhat's False\n\nHowever, the contract covered 104 plants, not eight, and included weekly maintenance services beyond just watering.\n\nIn early March 2025, social media users shared a rumor that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs canceled a $56,000 contract for watering roughly eight plants for five years and that the Department of Government Efficiency would water these plants for free.\n\nThe claim spread on multiple social media platforms, including Facebook, Reddit and TikTok.\n\nA post on DOGE's official X account on March 6 sparked the rumor (archived). It read: \"The VA cancelled a $56,000 contract to water ~8 plants for 5 years. This is ~$1400/plant/year. The contract has been canceled and DOGE will water the plants free of charge.\"\n\nDOGE did not provide any further details or evidence regarding the number of plants covered or the specific services included in the contract. Its announcement came amid the VA's broader plan to terminate \"585 non-mission-critical or duplicative contracts.\"\n\nHowever, the claim that the VA canceled a $56,000 contract solely for watering roughly eight plants over five years is false. It is true that in early March 2025 the VA terminated a $56,000 contract for \"interior plant maintenance\"; however, it covered 104 plants and included weekly upkeep services such as pruning, cleaning and plant replacement, not just watering. Therefore, we have rated this claim as a mixture of true and false information.\n\nWhat we know about the plant maintenance contract\n\nPublicly available records on USASpending.gov — an official, open-to-the-public resource for tracking government spending — show that the VA did indeed award a contract worth up to $56,551 to Frontline Enterprises. The company, which says its aim is to provide employment opportunities to \"disabled veterans and their spouses,\" specializes in construction, facilities maintenance, janitorial services, landscaping and green cleaning.\n\nThe USASpending.gov database categorized the contract under \"interior plant maintenance\" but did not specify the exact services covered, the number of plants or the frequency of service. It only mentioned that the contract included utilities and housekeeping services and interior plantscaping.\n\nHowever, Frontline Enterprises said via LinkedIn message that the contract covered the weekly maintenance of 104 plants over a five-year period for a total cost of $56,000 (or $11,200 per year).\n\nThe company further explained that this amounted to $107.70 per plant each year or approximately $9 per plant each month for weekly upkeep. The services included watering, pruning, trimming, cleaning and dusting the foliage as well as maintaining proper soil levels, disease prevention and control, fertilization and plant replacement (except in cases of damage or loss beyond the company's control).\n\nSnopes has contacted the VA and Frontline Enterprises for further comment and will update this article if we receive a response.\n\nIn early March 2025, the USASpending.gov website indicated that $19,265 of the contract had already been spent. Exactly $33,370 was obligated under the contract, and the total potential award amount was $56,551.\n\nAt the time the previous link was archived, the current end date was listed as March 31, 2026, and the potential end date was March 31, 2028. However, as of March 13, the contract's current and potential end dates were both updated to March 6, 2025. This coincided with DOGE's post on X.\n\nNo other records in the USASpending.gov database matched the details of the contract shared by DOGE. However, between 2016 and 2019, Frontline Enterprises received a similar VA contract totaling $55,729 for plant maintenance services.\n\nPhotographs shared by DOGE\n\nFinally, DOGE included two photos in its post. The first showed an indoor setting with a wooden table positioned against a wall and two framed portraits hanging above it. There was a large, leafy plant on each side of the table. The second showed a close-up of a printed sign on the wooden table displaying pictures of various indoor plants and containing the text: \"Please do not water these plants. These plants are serviced by a plant contractor. Thank you. Buildings Management Division.\"\n\n(X account @DOGE)\n\nHowever, the origins of the pictures were unclear, including where and when they were taken. Reverse image searches on Google produced no evidence of them appearing online prior to DOGE's original post.",

The New York Times said it had spoken to five sources \"with knowledge of the events\" for its report but did not name them.\n\nNewsweek contacted the MSNBC press office for comment on Tuesday via email outside of regular office hours.\n\nThe Claim\n\nThe MSNBC News segment was posted on the network's official website with the title: \"Musk demoted! Go inside Trump's EXPLOSIVE, angry Cabinet meeting reported by NY Times.\"\n\nThe Facts\n\nAccording to the New York Times article, Musk clashed with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Secretary of State Marco Rubio over cuts DOGE had been imposing on their respective departments.\n\nDonald Trump created DOGE, which despite its name isn't an official government department but effectively an advisory body, following his second presidential inauguration on January 20. DOGE was placed under the command of Musk, a close Trump ally who has argued federal government spending needs to be radically cut back.\n\nSince its creation DOGE has overseen significant cuts including firing thousands of probationary workers from across the federal government, though this is facing legal challenges, and gutting the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).\n\nThe New York Times reported Duffy told Musk his DOGE team were trying to lay off air traffic controllers, which the billionaire business tycoon said was a \"lie.\" Musk then allegedly told Rubio he had fired \"nobody,\" to which the secretary of state replied that 1,500 State Department officials had accepted a buyout offer and asked if they should be rehired again so they could be fired.\n\nAccording to the newspaper, after the argument \"dragged on for an uncomfortable time\" Trump intervened to say Rubio had done a \"great job,\" and also praised Musk and other cabinet secretaries.\n\nIt continued: \"The president made clear he still supported the mission of the Musk initiative. But now was the time, he said, to be a bit more refined in its approach. From now on, he said, the secretaries would be in charge; the Musk team would only advise.\"\n\nNeither the New York Times article, nor Ari Melber's MSNBC broadcast, stated that Musk had been subject to any formal demotion.\n\nThe Ruling\n\nFalse.\n\nWhile the New York Times piece said DOGE had lost some of its power, and would from now on only provide spending advice to the various departmental secretaries, it did not at any point say Musk had received a formal demotion. Similarly, while MSNBC used the word \"demoted\" in the online title for Melber's segment, this word didn't feature in the broadcast itself.\n\nFACT CHECK BY Newsweek",

        "full_text": "Google is buying the cybersecurity firm Wiz for $32 billion — its biggest acquisition ever.\n\nIt's also the biggest deal of the year so far and a major test for Donald Trump's antitrust policy.\n\nA deal of this size could also supercharge more M&A following a slow few years.\n\nJust as 2025 was off to a slow start for M&A, Google announced its largest-ever acquisition.\n\nGoogle's parent company, Alphabet, and Wiz confirmed Tuesday that they had reached an agreement on the $32 billion all-cash deal.\n\nThe two companies were in talks last year for a $23 billion deal, but they fizzled out, and Wiz later said it would instead pursue an initial public offering.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said during a Tuesday briefing that the Wiz acquisition would boost its cloud security offering at a time when AI is bringing \"new risks\" and \"multi-cloud and hybrid are becoming the norm.\"\n\n\"Against this backdrop, organizations are looking for cybersecurity solutions that improve cloud security and span multiple clouds,\" he added.\n\nWiz, an Israeli-founded startup headquartered in New York, specializes in technology that scans everything companies put onto the cloud and identifies security risks. Under the agreement, Wiz's services would continue to be available through other cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, Thomas Kurian, Google Cloud's CEO, said in the Tuesday briefing.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi, Google's CFO, said the company expects the deal to close in 2026, subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nFor Google, the deal would give it the chance to show customers its cloud offerings — which trail behind those of Microsoft and Amazon — are as secure as can be. \"With Wiz, we believe we will vastly improve how security is designed, operated, and automated,\" Kurian added.\n\nHere's why the acquisition is a big deal for startup exits and a big test for the Trump administration.\n\nReturn of startup dealmaking?\n\nA deal of this size could catalyze more startup M&A activity following a sluggish few years.\n\nRelated stories\n\nLast year, there were 2,066 VC-backed startup M&A exits, worth $83.6 billion, according to PitchBook data. The first quarter of 2025 was off to a slower start, with 382 M&A deals worth $13.6 billion.\n\nAs the biggest deal of the year so far, Google's $32 billion purchase of Wiz has tipped the scales significantly, potentially pointing to more appetite for acquisitions as an exit route.\n\n\"Acquisitions allow startups to avoid the inherent volatility of public markets altogether and just focus on long-term growth and their daily operations,\" Mariam Pettit, the managing partner of Graph Theory Capital, told Business Insider, adding that an acquisition could deliver faster returns than an IPO.\n\nStartups have been gravitating toward secondary share sales and acquisitions in lieu of public listings for multiple reasons. The IPO process can be tough, requiring thorough auditing of a company's financials, potential restructurings, and regulatory compliance — as well as more intense quarterly scrutiny, Pettit said.\n\nThe US IPO market remained relatively dormant in 2024 despite high multiples and low volatility. PitchBook data showed that most VC-backed listings underperformed last year, with Instacart, Klaviyo, and Ibotta trading significantly lower relative to the Morningstar Growth Index.\n\nWiz's deal with Google would offer the company an avenue to bolster its growth, a person familiar with the process told BI, adding that the company surpassed $700 million in annual recurring revenue in the last quarter.\n\nA test for Trump's antitrust policy\n\nThe $32 billion acquisition could serve as a test of the regulatory environment under the Trump administration.\n\nWhile President Donald Trump was expected to usher in a more favorable M&A environment, Vice President JD Vance had previously voiced support for stricter dealmaking rules. Last year, he backed legislation to eliminate tax breaks for corporate mergers, signaling a stance closer to former FTC chair Lina Khan, who, under Biden, launched investigations into Microsoft and Amazon's businesses.\n\nAndrew Ferguson, Khan's replacement, said in February that the Trump administration would continue to use strict corporate merger guidelines adopted under Biden.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Google is facing two antitrust lawsuits, including one against its search business that was brought during Trump's first term.\n\nTwo recent Google mergers have come under close scrutiny by regulators but ultimately passed: its $2.1 billion acquisition of Fitbit in 2021 and its purchase of the cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion in 2022.\n\nEvelyn Mitchell-Wolf, an EMARKETER senior analyst, described the merger as a \"bold move\" in the current regulatory landscape.\n\n\"Given its price tag — and the fact that Google's already been found guilty of anticompetitive conduct in the search market — the acquisition will attract too much scrutiny to go through completely unimpeded,\" she said.",

        "full_text": "Chinese state media has welcomed Donald Trump's move to cut public funding for news outlets Voice of America and Radio Free Asia, which have long reported on authoritarian regimes.\n\nThe decision affects thousands of employees - some 1,300 staff have been put on paid leave at Voice Of America (VOA) alone since Friday's executive order.\n\nCritics have called the move a setback for democracy but Beijing's state newspaper Global Times denounced VOA for its \"appalling track record\" in reporting on China and said it has \"now been discarded by its own government like a dirty rag\".\n\nThe White House defended the move, saying it will \"ensure that taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda\".\n\nTrump's cuts target the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which is supported by Congress and funds the affected news outlets, such as VOA, Radio Free Asia (RFA) and Radio Free Europe.\n\nThey have won acclaim and international recognition for their reporting in places where press freedom is severely curtailed or non-existent, from China and Cambodia to Russia and North Korea.\n\nAlthough authorities in some of these countries block the broadcasts - VOA, for instance, is banned in China - people can listen to them on shortwave radio, or get around the restrictions via VPNs.\n\nRFA has often reported on the crackdown on human rights in Cambodia, whose former authoritarian ruler Hun Sen has hailed the cuts as a \"big contribution to eliminating fake news\".\n\nIt was also among the first news outlets to report on China's network of detention centres in Xinjiang, where the authorities are accused of locking up hundreds of thousands of Uyghur Muslims without trial. Beijing denies the claims, saying people willingly attend \"re-education camps\" which combat \"terrorism and religious extremism\". VOA's reporting on North Korean defectors and the Chinese Communist Party's alleged cover-up of Covid fatalities has won awards.\n\nVOA, primarily a radio outlet, which also broadcasts in Mandarin, was recognised last year for its podcast on rare protests in 2022 in China against Covid lockdowns.\n\nBut China's Global Times welcomed the cuts, calling VOA a \"lie factory\".\n\n\"As more Americans begin to break through their information cocoons and see a real world and a multi-dimensional China, the demonising narratives propagated by VOA will ultimately become a laughing stock,\" it said in an editorial published on Monday.\n\nHu Xijin, who was the Global Times' former editor-in-chief, wrote: \"Voice of America has been paralysed! And so has Radio Free Asia, which has been as vicious to China. This is such great news.\"\n\nSuch responses \"would have been easy to predict\", said Valdya Baraputri, a VOA journalist who lost her job over the weekend. She was previously employed by BBC World Service.\n\n\"Eliminating VOA, of course, allows channels that are the opposite of accurate and balanced reporting to thrive,\" she told the BBC.\n\nThe National Press Club, a leading representative group for US journalists, said the order \"undermines America's long-standing commitment to a free and independent press\".\n\nFounded during World War Two in part to counter Nazi propaganda, VOA reaches some 360 million people a week in nearly 50 languages. Over the years it has broadcast in China, North Korea, communist Cuba and the former Soviet Union. It's also been a helpful tool for many Chinese people to learn English.\n\nVOA's director Michael Abramowitz said Trump's order has hobbled VOA while \"America's adversaries, like Iran, China, and Russia, are sinking billions of dollars into creating false narratives to discredit the United States\".\n\nMs Baraputri, who is from Indonesia but based in Washington DC, first joined VOA in 2018, but her visa was terminated at the end of Trump's first administration.\n\nShe rejoined in 2023 because she wanted to be part of an organisation that \"upholds unbiased, factual reporting that is free from government influence\".\n\nThe recent cuts have left her \"feeling betrayed by the idea I had about press freedom [in the US]\".\n\nShe is also concerned for colleagues who may now be forced to return to hostile home countries, where they could be persecuted for their journalism.\n\nMeanwhile, the Czech Republic has appealed to the European Union to intervene so it can keep Radio Free Europe going. It reports in 27 languages from 23 countries, reaching more than 47 million people every week.\n\nRFA chief executive Bay Fang said in a statement that the organisation plans to challenge the order. Cutting funding to these outlets is a \"reward to dictators and despots, including the Chinese Communist Party, who would like nothing better than to have their influence go unchecked in the information space\", he said.\n\nRFA started in 1996 and reaches nearly 60 million people weekly in China, Myanmar, North Korea, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos. In China, it also broadcasts in minority languages like Tibetan and Uyghur, apart from English and Mandarin.\n\n\"[Trump's order] not only disenfranchises the nearly 60 million people who turn to RFA's reporting on a weekly basis to learn the truth, but it also benefits America's adversaries at our own expense,\" Mr Fang noted.\n\nWhile Chinese state media has celebrated the cuts, it's hard to know how Chinese people feel about it given their internet is heavily censored.\n\nOutside China, those who have listened to VOA and RFA over the years appear disappointed and worried.\n\n\"Looking back at history, countless exiles, rebels, intellectuals, and ordinary people have persisted in the darkness because of the voices of VOA and RFA, and have seen hope in fear because of their reports,\" Du Wen, a Chinese dissident living in Belgium, wrote on X.\n\n\"If the free world chooses to remain silent, then the voice of the dictator will become the only echo in the world.\"",

        "full_text": "The mother of a girl attending an Illinois middle school said that after her daughter refused to change her clothes in front of a biological boy who identified as a transgender girl, school officials stepped in and forced her to do so.\n\nNicole Georgas told the story of what she said happened to her 13-year-old daughter and other girls at Shepard Middle School while speaking at a Deerfield School District 109 School Board meeting on Thursday, National Review reported. Deerfield is a suburb of Chicago. Georgas said her daughter came home upset on February 5, saying a boy was using the girl’s bathroom.\n\nAccording to Georgas, the girl was then told by school administrators that the boy was allowed to use the girl’s locker room and bathroom because he identified as a girl, and the school’s “inclusive” bathroom policy allowed him to use whichever locker room he wanted. Georgas said she spoke to school administrators and told them they were violating President Donald Trump’s executive order that prohibited males from using female locker rooms and participating in girls’ sports. The school stood its ground, citing the district’s legal counsel.\n\nAfter this exchange, Georgas said Thursday, “the situation went from bad to worse.”\n\n“A few days later, the male student was present in the girl’s locker room. Feeling violated, the girls made the choice not to change into their PE clothes with the biological male student present,” Georgas said.\n\nThe mother said that school administrators then supervised the girls’ locker room to make sure that the girls changed their clothes in front of the transgender-identifying boy without protest. She identified the district’s assistant superintendent for student services, the school’s assistant principal, and the director for student services as the administrators who forced the girls to change in front of the boy, according to the Lake County Gazette.\n\n“The girls just want their privacy and they want their locker room back,” she said. “There are gender neutral options. This is my daughter’s story, and the story of many other young girls who have been forced at the difficult age to do something they know and most adults know is wrong.”\n\nGeorgas’ story received boos from transgender activists in attendance at the school board meeting, including one transgender-identifying person who also happens to have a child identifying as transgender.\n\n“The discomfort or privacy concerns of other students, teachers, or parents are not valid reasons to deny or limit the full and equal use of those facilities based on a student’s gender-related identity,” said the activist, who serves as the director of operations for Trans Up Front, an activist organization. “Instead, any student, teacher or other individuals seeking more privacy should be accommodated by providing that individual with a more private option.”\n\nGeorgas said she filed a civil rights complaint with the Justice Department.",

        "full_text": "Personnel from the Department of Government Efficiency, accompanied by DC police officers, gained access to the US Institute of Peace Monday after being turned away last week.\n\nThe dramatic escalation follows the Trump administration’s Friday gutting of the organization’s board and tees up another court fight between the administration and an independent organization.\n\n“DOGE has broken into our building,” acting USIP president George Moose, whom the Trump administration said has been fired from the role, said in a statement Monday.\n\nThe administration fired most of USIP’s board on Friday and its three remaining members – Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Defense University President Peter Garvin – said they were installing Kenneth Jackson as acting USIP president. Jackson was among the personnel who entered the building on Monday, according to the institute’s chief security officer.\n\nUSIP does not see that appointment as legal. The institute, which works to resolve conflict, is not a federal agency. It was created by Congress as a nonpartisan, independent body in 1984, and USIP owns and manages its headquarters.\n\nAccording to USIP’s chief security officer Colin O’Brien, the organization on Monday called the DC Metropolitan Police after former security contractors, whose contracts were suspended Sunday, entered the building without permission.\n\nWhen he went to greet the police, O’Brien recounted, “they held the door open and allowed members of DOGE to enter the building, where they were also followed by 10 to 12 police officers, uniformed DC police officers.”\n\nThose DOGE personnel, most of whom O’Brien said would not identify themselves, told him, USIP’s general counsel and members of the operations staff to exit the building, he said.\n\nMore police officers arrived later in the day with lock-picking devices and were seen entering a side door of the building.\n\nIn a post on X, DOGE alleged that Moose “denied lawful access to Kenneth Jackson, the Acting USIP President (as approved by the USIP Board).” DOGE said DC police “arrived onsite and escorted Mr. Jackson into the building.”\n\n“The only unlawful individual was Mr. Moose, who refused to comply, and even tried to fire USIP’s private security team when said security team went to give access to Mr. Jackson,” DOGE said in the post, which linked to a memo from the three Trump officials appointing Jackson as acting president.\n\nA DC police spokesperson told CNN that the police department responded to an unlawful entry report at USIP. “Individuals who were asked to leave by the management at that facility left,” they said. “There were no arrests made and no incidents to report.”\n\nSome USIP officials remained in the building after DOGE’s arrival, including Moose, a retired career diplomat. He was later forced to exit the building by DC police.\n\nIn an interview done by phone from his locked office as DOGE went through the building, Moose said he had expected DOGE would return to try to gain access to USIP.\n\nOver the weekend, he said, “representatives of the FBI and of the US Attorney’s Office of the District of Columbia were approaching members of our staff and our workforce to try to intimidate their way into getting into the building.”\n\n“We had not expected that the FBI would succeed in enlisting the support and collaboration of the District of Columbia police, with whom we have had a great relationship,” Moose said. “Somehow, FBI has managed to convince the DC police that this is a building that is owned by the US government and not by the US Institute of Peace.”\n\nO’Brien told CNN that the FBI called him over the weekend, and two FBI agents went to the home of one of his security officers.\n\nThe FBI referred a request for comment to the DOJ. CNN has reached out to the Department of Justice.\n\nMoose said that USIP plans to fight the DOGE moves “vigorously” in court.\n\n“We are confident of our legal status, and we are confident that a court that gives us a hearing will be persuaded by the strength of our legal argument,” Moose said after departing the building.\n\n“It’s not the first building I’ve been called upon to try to defend. We’ve had to defend embassies all around the world, in Africa, where I spent most of my career in pursuit of our mission,” he said. “This is obviously, this is not a great day for this. This is not a happy day for anybody that somehow, this misunderstanding of our intent, our purpose has reached a point where folks are going to come and try it.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Don Beyer, who arrived on the scene later in the evening Monday, said he’ll “report back to House leadership” and “we’ll try to do something in the US Congress.”\n\n“USIP is a congressionally chartered nonprofit. It is not a federal agency. We think it’s clearly illegal and unconstitutional for DOGE to be taking it over,” he told CNN.\n\nO’Brien, the chief security officer, said he had never experienced anything like Monday’s events in his tenure at USIP.\n\n“It’s disappointing,” he told CNN. “When you look at the mission of the United States Institute of Peace, its job is to prevent Americans from getting into costly wars. It’s to bring peace, and our president has said he wants to be a peacemaker, and we are ready, willing and able to assist with that mission.”",

        "full_text": "Voters are starting 2025 sour on the state of the economy and President Donald Trump’s handling of it so far, even as his election to a second term sparked an upswing in positive feelings about the direction of the nation, according to a new national NBC News poll.\n\nBuoyed by jubilant and unified Republicans, who are standing in lockstep with Trump and the expansive agenda he and congressional leaders are pushing in Washington, more registered voters see the U.S. as heading in the right direction than at any point since early 2004, though a majority still say the country is on the wrong track. Trump’s approval rating also equals his best-ever mark as president (47%), though again, a majority (51%) disapproves of his performance.\n\nMeanwhile, driven in part by a pessimistic shift among Democrats since Trump’s election, just 18% of voters rate the economy as “excellent” or “good” — not as low as the poorest economic marks during the Biden administration, according to CNBC polling from 2022, but within a handful of points and as low as that mark has been in NBC News polling since 2014. Majorities of voters disapprove of Trump’s early job performance on the economy (54% disapprove, 44% approve) and how he’s handling inflation and the cost of living (55% disapprove, 42% approve).\n\nIt’s a new development for Trump, who never previously had a majority against his handling of the economy in a national NBC News poll. Now, he is confronting jittery markets and businesses amid his early moves to put tariffs on U.S. neighbors and other allies. Trump also faces questions from voters about whether he is sufficiently focused on their core issue of costs as he pursues other projects like reshaping the federal bureaucracy.\n\nOverall, the poll reflects an America that remains deeply divided in the months following Trump’s 2024 victory, as it was in the months before.\n\nVoters narrowly disapprove of Trump’s overall job performance, but the margin is closer than at almost any point during his first term. His personal ratings and the share of Republicans identifying as part of the MAGA movement have grown, reflecting the unity inside his party giving him wide latitude in a GOP-controlled Washington.\n\nIn another change from Trump’s first term in the White House, the public has come around on his deportation-focused immigration policies, though voters are wary of his handling of other issues, including foreign policy.\n\nVoters like the general idea of the Department of Government Efficiency, the Trump-blessed effort to slash government jobs and spending. But they harbor reservations about its rapid-fire execution so far, as well as about billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk, DOGE’s de facto head.\n\nAnd voters are split evenly on which party they’d like to see win the 2026 midterm elections, even as the Democratic Party faces record-low popularity and fractious divides over how to respond to Trump. (The survey was conducted March 7-11, before Senate Democrats provided a handful of votes to help resolve a government funding fight.)\n\n“While this survey shows a mixed result for Donald Trump, Democrats are the ones in the wilderness right now,” said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies. Horwitt called Trump’s upside-down numbers among independents “a flashing red light across the survey.”\n\nMcInturff noted how Trump has fortified his base over the last year. The political story of the next year, he said, will be whether voter dissatisfaction on the economy or other issues takes hold — “or the strength of the Republican and Trump base has maintained a very competitive election” in 2026, McInturff continued.\n\nTrump's expanded base and key issues\n\nTrump’s job approval rating (47%) and personal favorable rating (46%), along with the 44% who believe the country is on the right track, are at all-time highs in NBC News polling during his political career.\n\nBut they are also far below where previous presidents stood during the “honeymoon period” of new administrations, marking the polarization that has defined the Trump years. Slightly more disapprove of Trump’s job performance (51%) and view him personally negatively (49%), and 54% see the country as on the wrong track.\n\nUnderscoring the deep partisan divide, Trump has the largest gap of any president in the last 80 years between his approval rating among members of his own party (90%) and his approval rating from the opposing party (4%), according to an analysis of three decades of NBC News polling and earlier data from Gallup.\n\nAmong independents, 30% approve and 67% disapprove of Trump’s performance in office. A large gender gap still persists, with men approving of Trump’s job performance 55%-43%, while women split the other way, 40%-58%.\n\nVice President JD Vance is viewed positively by 41% of voters and negatively by 47%. That compares unfavorably to the even or positive appraisals of vice presidents at the beginning of the previous three administrations, according to NBC News polls.\n\nWhen it comes to the issues, Trump fares particularly well on immigration. Fifty-five percent of voters approve of his handling of border security and immigration, while 43% disapprove. A similar share, 56%, say he’s bringing the “right kind of change” on the issue, while 25% say he’s bringing the wrong change and 18% say he isn’t bringing change.\n\nBut that’s the only one of the five issues tested in the poll — border security and immigration, foreign policy, the economy, inflation and cost of living, and the war between Russia and Ukraine — that sees a majority of American voters approve of how Trump is handling it.\n\nForty-five percent of voters approve of his handling of foreign policy and 53% disapprove of it, while 42% approve of his handling of the war between Russia and Ukraine, with 55% disapproving.\n\nCost concerns dominate on the economy\n\nThe split between how voters see his delivery on immigration and on economic issues comes after Trump identified them as the twin pillars of his 2024 victory, telling NBC News’ “Meet the Press” in December: “I won on the border and I won on groceries.”\n\nJust 1% rate the economy as “excellent” and 17% as “good,” with 39% calling it “only fair” and 43% rating it “poor.” While Republicans are more likely to have favorable views of the economy than others, majorities across virtually every demographic still view the economy in an unfavorable light.\n\nAbout one-third (32%) of voters say their family’s income is staying about even with the cost of living, but 60% say it’s falling behind. Another 7% say their family’s income is rising faster than the cost of living.\n\nAsked to gauge their satisfaction about how much Trump is doing to battle inflation, a majority say they aren’t satisfied — 46% say they are “not at all satisfied” and another 9% say they are “not too satisfied,” while 20% are “somewhat” satisfied and 23% are “very” satisfied.\n\nThe NBC News poll also gauged voters’ feelings on what kind of change Trump is bringing as president, with 40% saying he’s bringing the right kind of change to inflation and the cost of living, while 30% say he’s bringing the wrong change and 28% say he isn’t bringing change.\n\nOn trade and tariffs, 41% say he’s bringing the right change, 38% say the wrong change and 18% say he is not bringing change.\n\nOverall, 46% said Trump is bringing the right kind of change, 30% said he’s bringing the wrong kind of change, and 21% said he’s not bringing change.\n\nDOGE and Musk are early flashpoints\n\nVoters are open, narrowly, to an effort to tackle inefficiencies in government. But concerns about Musk and about how DOGE is executing those cuts could be a public opinion liability for the administration.\n\nForty-six percent of voters say establishing a Department of Government Efficiency was a good idea, while 40% say it was a bad idea and another 13% do not have an opinion. However, DOGE itself is viewed unfavorably, with 41% holding positive views of the effort and 47% holding negative views.\n\nAnd Musk is unpopular, with 51% holding negative views of the tech mogul and 39% viewing him positively. Half of voters (49%) say they have positive views about federal workers, while 21% view them negatively and 29% feel neutral about them.\n\nAsked to reflect broadly on DOGE, one-third of voters said Musk and DOGE’s efforts to reduce spending and the size of the federal government “should continue as much more needs to be done.” Meanwhile, 28% say “it is needed but should slow down to assess the impact.” And another 33% say “it is reckless and should stop now before more damage is done.”\n\nDemocrats at a low point\n\nWhile Trump’s standing is largely based on overwhelming support from within his own party, the Democratic Party now sits at its lowest favorable rating in the history of NBC News polling. Just 27% of registered voters view the party positively. That includes just 59% of self-identified Democrats.\n\nMeanwhile, 65% of Democrats say they want Democratic lawmakers to stick to their positions even if this means not being able to get things done in Washington, while 32% want them to compromise with Trump to gain consensus on legislation.\n\nStill, voters remain split as to who they want to control Congress after next year’s midterm elections: 48% back Democrats, while 47% back Republicans.\n\nHow different groups are handling Trump\n\nAs Trump dominates Washington, 53% of registered voters say Republicans in Congress are too supportive of the president, 6% say they are too critical and 39% say they are dealing with Trump in the right way. By comparison, 50% say congressional Democrats are too critical of Trump, 16% say they are too supportive of him and 30% say they are dealing with him in the right way.\n\nA plurality, 44%, believe the Supreme Court is dealing with Trump in the right way, while 35% believe it’s been too supportive and 14% believe it’s been too critical.\n\nA near-majority, 49%, say that CEOs of large corporations are too supportive of Trump, 29% believe they are dealing with him correctly and 12% believe they are being too critical.\n\nAnd when it comes to the news media, 46% of voters say it has been too critical of Trump, 25% say it’s been too supportive, and 24% say it’s been dealing with Trump the right way.\n\nThe NBC News poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters from March 7-11 via a mix of telephone interviews and an online survey sent via text message. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.",

        "full_text": "President Trump announced he will release 80,000 pages of unredacted files Tuesday about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, after promising on the campaign trail to declassify the documents.\n\n“While we’re here, I thought it would be appropriate — we are, tomorrow, announcing and giving all of the Kennedy files. So, people have been waiting for decades for this, and I’ve instructed my people … lots of different people, [Director of National Intelligence] Tulsi Gabbard, that they must be released tomorrow,” the president told reporters while touring the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.\n\n“You got a lot of reading. I don’t believe we’re going to redact anything. I said, ‘just don’t redact, you can’t redact,’” the president said, adding it will be about 80,000 pages that he described as “interesting.”\n\nHe said he has “heard about them” when asked if he has seen what’s in the files; he added, “I’m not doing summaries, you’ll write your own summary.”\n\nTrump in January signed an executive order directing the release of federal government documents related to the assassinations of Kennedy, former Attorney General Robert F .Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nThe order instructed the director of national intelligence and attorney general to present a plan within 15 days for the “full and complete release of records relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.”\n\nTrump promised during his 2024 campaign to declassify the remaining government documents about the John F. Kennedy assassination, which has remained a point of public interest for decades after Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas in 1963 by Lee Harvey Oswald. Conspiracies have persisted about CIA involvement or the existence of another shooter.\n\n“I said during the campaign I’d do it, and I’m a man of my word,” Trump said Monday.\n\nTrump made the same pledge during his first term, but he ultimately kept some documents under wraps amid intelligence concerns.\n\nThe last large dump of documents was in 2022, when the National Archives released nearly 13,000 new files related to the assassination.\n\nCongress passed legislation in 1992 requiring all remaining government records about the John F. Kennedy assassination to be released by October 2017, unless they posed certain risks to national defense or intelligence, and both Trump and former President Biden issued extensions to keep certain documents private.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc.

        "full_text": "I’ve been spending some time recently with top Democrats, as they think about how to rebuild after the 2024 loss. And I’ll say that in some years I’ve been covering politics, I have never heard them so confused. America is back. How could they possibly lost this election to this person. Also, how is the Democratic Party weakening. So much among groups whose strength, whose support it once took for granted. Young voters. Non-white voters. Working class voters. What does it mean that the Democratic Party is losing what was once its base, its reliable base. Someone whose analysis on this have come to respect over the years is David Shor. David Shor is the head of data science at blowers research, which is a big Democratic consulting firm. So first, this is a big table of numbers. It does a huge amount of political surveying and interpretation of data and testing of messaging. And he’s gotten a lot of things right before other people did, including that educational polarization was becoming the central fault line for American democracy. And so when I saw Shor recently and he began walking me through some of his slides, some of the ways he was interpreting the 2024 election and trying to help people see what had happened. My first thought was this would be worth doing in public, rather than this being a thing that Democrats are debating in Backrooms with each other. What if we did this in public. And so this episode is a bit of an experiment. He’s walking me through this presentation and I am interrogating it. But I found this really, really helpful. I don’t necessarily have every conclusion, David does, but I think it is a good place to begin. And there’s then a lot that can follow from having this conversation. As always, my email at nytimes.com. David Shor, welcome to the show. Excited to be here. So what do you do. And why should I trust the data you’re about to show us here. I’m glad. I’m glad you asked. I’m the co-founder of a research firm called blue rose research. We did 26 million interviews last year, and we have a team of about 45 people, machine learning engineers, software engineers from companies like Google. And, we’ve done a lot of work to try to figure out what actually happened last year. A lot of liberals I feel really burnt by survey data. There’s a sense that nobody picks up the phone. How are you surveying these older people if you’re doing it online. Putting aside the fact that you conducted a lot of surveys, why are you confident those surveys reflect reality. The fundamental problem with survey research is just that people who answer surveys are really weird. There’s two ways that you can try to fix that. One is that you could try to get a normal representative set of people. That’s just impossible in today’s day and age. And the other is that you can just try to collect a lot of information so that you can adjust for how weird they are. The reason I feel fairly confident about this is just in our work, every time we make any change to any part of our system, we go back and back, test and see how it affects accuracy across every other election that we’ve ever surveyed. We can’t be fully confident about any particular thing that we say. A lot of the data isn’t back yet, but I think that there’s enough data to tell a coherent story. There’s the 26 million survey respondents of 8 million unique people. There’s precinct and County level election results. We’re also going to try to tie together all of the external data that other people have done. And what I’ll say about this election is that our forecast. This cycle were very accurate. Our overall error was about 1/3 of a percent nationally. And I think that a lot most of the things that we thought would happen. Did bear out. And I do want to spend a second to answer, something that you had asked a second ago, which is just like, why look at survey data. I think that Super politically engaged people are overrepresented at every single step of the political process. They’re more likely to run for office. They’re more likely to work in campaigns and journalism. They’re more likely to listen to podcasts like this one. And I think that they’re really the only point other than election day, when regular people get a say is in polls. And so I think there isn’t really any Democratic alternative to trying to listen to the people and hear what they have to say. So I take that point. I always think it is good to remind me and everybody who listens to the show that they are weird. And if their intuitions about politics were shared, politics would not look the way it does at all. Right If the voting population were, show listeners and people they then elections end up very differently. So I take your point on survey data. So where do we begin. All right. So first I’m just going to start with this slide over here that just looks at support for the Democratic presidential candidate in 2016 and 2020 and 2024 by race and ideology. In 2016, Democrats got 81 percent of Hispanic moderates, and in 2024, Democrats got 58 percent of Hispanic moderates. That’s only about 7 percent more than the 52 percent that they got of white moderates. The main story with respect to this is just a continuation of the trends that we saw four years ago. Throughout the entire Trump campaign, we’ve seen this racial polarization. The thing I find most surprising here is you look at white voters liberal, moderate and conservative. And at least in this data from 2016 to 2024, there is a 0 percent swing in any of them, because there are all these things that if you go back to the debates we were having about Donald Trump, then it is the return and resurgence of a coalition trying to protect white power in this country. And I wrote things about this. I think there was good reason to believe that even if that was part of the intention, then that does not appear in the results. So the Democrats lose modest amount of support among Black voters in those years. They lose a huge amount of support among Hispanic voters and a significant amount among Asian voters. Why do you think that is. I think that a lot of political analysis in America has been really centered around viewing everything through a very America centric lens, because there’s this story in American politics. If you want to understand 20th century American politics, then the big story is that there was this giant Southern realignment in 1964, driven by the Civil Rights Act, driven by the Civil Rights Act, and that carried forward. It took a really long time for that to really work its way through downballot. And so I think it was really tempting for American political scientists and a lot. The more detail oriented American political pundits to just kind of see everything. People who wrote books like why were polarized, for instance. Yeah, exactly just to see everything through this transformation. Thomas Piketty actually recently wrote a great book about this thing I’m about to talk about. But I think the most important trend politically of the last 30 to 40 years, both here and in every other country in the world, at least Western country that has elections has been the story of education, polarization. That basically everywhere we’ve seen highly educated people move to the left and working class people move to the right. I think a lot of people’s analytical error when looking at Trump is that they saw Trump as this kind of reincarnation of the 1960s of like George Wallace or something, when really I think he was representing this global trend. You could look at a bunch of other countries. You have Marine Le Pen in France, you have the AFD in Germany. And I think that people miss that. There was kind of a broader global appeal, this kind of polarization on values. The other thing that I find interesting here is the shift in voters who self-describe as conservative, right. There’s no shift in white, self-described conservative voters between 2016 and 2024, but Democrats are winning 85 percent of Black conservatives in 2016, but only 77 percent in 2024. They’re winning 34 percent of conservative Hispanics in 2016. That falls by half to 17 percent in 2024. They’re winning 28 percent of conservative Asians in 2016. That falls to 20 percent in 2024. So it’s always a little bit weird for somebody who is self-described conservative to be voting for Democrats who are quite a Liberal Party now. But what we’re seeing among nonwhite voters is people voting more their ideology and less their ethnic group. That’s exactly right. And I would just say, I think this shouldn’t be that surprising. I think now, we identify the Democratic Party as straightforwardly liberal. The Democratic Party used to be a coalition between liberals and moderates and conservatives. And as liberals kind of became the dominant coalition partner. It makes sense, that the conservatives and moderates in our coalition, who were disproportionately nonwhite, given that this ideological polarization happened among whites 20 years ago or 30 years ago, that you would start to see this. All right. Let’s move to slide two here. All right. But there were some new trends this cycle. So I can hear you going to presentation voice. Yeah great. Great, great. You’re good. So this slide over here has what I think is probably the most important story of this cycle. So I have two graphs over here. The first breaks down 2020 for support by whether or not you had voted in 2020. And so this is New York Times’ data from Nate Cohen’s upshot polling, probably the highest quality public pollster in America. And what you can see here is just that in 2020, in their data, people who didn’t vote if they had voted would have been a little bit more Democratic than the country overall. But over the next four years, people who didn’t vote went from being a somewhat Democratic leaning group to a group that Trump won by double digits. So the second graph here, we have for every precinct, we look at what percentage of people voted in 2022. And then we just look at what was the change in Democratic vote share from 2020 to 2024. And so what you can see here is that for the lowest turnout precincts, Trump increased his vote share by something like 6 percent While for the highest turnout precincts, Harris actually increased her support. And that’s really the story of this election is that people who follow news really closely, who get their news from traditional media, who say that politics is an important part of their identity. They became more Democratic in absolute terms. But for people who don’t follow politics closely at all, they just became a lot more Republican. It’s interesting because I obviously get a lot of incoming from people who would like the New York Times’ to cover Donald Trump differently. And some of those arguments I agree with, some of them I don’t. That’s what I always think about with that, though, is that if your lever is New York Times’ headlines, you’re not affecting the voters you are losing. And the question Democrats are facing. When you look at how badly they lost less politically engaged voters is, how do you change the views of voters. You don’t really have a good way to reach. Yeah, and I mean, that’s 100 percent And, I just want to stress that this is a new problem. This problem didn’t exist four years ago. And it’s not just that New York Times’ readers are more liberal than the overall population. That’s definitely true. It’s that they’re more liberal than they were four years ago, even though the country went the other way. And so there’s this great political divergence between people who consume all the news sources that we know about and read about versus the people who don’t. And so, as a result of these changes, we’re really this is really reversed, a decades long truism in American politics where for the longest time, Democrats have said, and it’s been true, that if everybody votes, we win. And that higher turnout is good for Democrats, and this is the first cycle where that definitively became the opposite of true. Here I just have some numbers. If only people who had voted in 2022 had voted, Harris would have won the popular vote and also the electoral college fairly easily. While if everyone had voted, Trump would have won the popular vote by nearly 5 points. Generally, what you see now is that every measure of socioeconomic status and political engagement is just monotonically related to your chance of liking Trump. What is monotonically related. Yeah sorry. Just that this is why Democrats can’t win. That’s exactly right. I’m the problem. But it’s basically just that the more even the lowest political engagement categories, the lowest education categories, the poorer the lower socioeconomic status, the less engaged you are in politics now, the more Trumpy you are. And that just wasn’t true four years ago. So here here’s something that I’ve heard from a lot of Democrats and very good election analysts, which seems to be in some tension here. There is an argument that what happened to Democrats between 2020 and 2024 is their voters stayed home. And so what happened here was a shrinking of the electorate that disproportionately sliced off what Democrats for a while were calling the anti MAGA coalition. How does that idea that Democrats didn’t lose to Trump, they lost to the couch set with you. It’s just not empirically correct. I would say generally turnout and support go in the same direction for the basic reason that there are a lot of people who didn’t feel ready to vote for a Republican but were still mad at the Democratic Party, and so they stayed home in response. And if you just look at the demographics of who these people are, who voted for Biden last time and stayed home this time, they’re generally low education. They’re fairly politically disengaged. They’re much less likely to watch shows like MSNBC and more likely to watch shows like Fox, and they frankly just look a lot like the voters who trended away from us. So if you had forced them out to vote, they may have just voted for Donald Trump. Exactly And that does show up. If you look at African-Americans, for example, African-Americans who didn’t vote were much more likely to say that they supported Trump than the ones that did this cycle. It’s true that overall turnout fell in a lot of the country, but in the battleground states that actually decided the presidential election, turnout was roughly where it was from four years ago. And it just is clear as day that a bunch of people changed their mind. How much is this just inflation. You are dealing with people who they’re not paying a lot of attention to politics. They do pay attention and feel prices and the state of the country. You had a massive inflationary period and they’re pissed and being pissed about inflation. Move them against the incumbent party, which they held responsible in this country, as in other countries, for inflation. I think that that’s a very reasonable explanation. It makes sense that the people who care the least about politics are going to be the most mad about prices going up, and there’s a lot of academic reasons to think that makes sense. I’m not making any claims, per se, about why this happened, though I think inflation makes sense. If you actually poll these non-voters and ask them what did they care the most about they’ll tell you inflation. I’ll get to this later. But that’s what every single subgroup of the electorate cared the most about by overwhelming margins. And so I don’t think it’s necessarily true that it’s impossible for us to win those voters back. But, I’ll talk about this later. There have been dramatic shifts in the media consumption habits of these people in the last four years. And so it may be a harder problem. Before you discuss, I think it’s worth talking to the next chart, too, because it’s getting at the same question in a different way. So here, we have a plot that we just took from The Economist. And in the bottom, we just have foreign born population and on the top we just have increase in Republican vote share. And what you could see is there’s a very clear correlation. This is by County. This is by County. There’s a very clear correlation between how many immigrants there were in a County and how much it increased by Donald Trump, towards Trump. You can see in counties like Queens, New York or miami-dade and Florida. Trump increased his vote share percentage by 10 percentage points, which is just crazy. And so when we go and we look at the precinct election results, what we see is that in immigrant communities of all races, our best guess is that immigrants went from being a Biden plus 27 group in 2020 to a group that Trump narrowly won in 2024. This group, of naturalized citizens is roughly 10 percent of the electorate. So that means that immigrants swung much, much, much more than the median of the electorate. That’s exactly right. Our estimates, and it’s really hard to know exactly what happened. It turns out that working class immigrants do not answer a ton of surveys, but our best guess is that they swung 23 percentage points against the Democratic Party. And so the crazy thing is, if you believe this and there’s some uncertainty, but I think some version of this is probably true, then something like half of the net votes that Trump received came from immigrants. And this wasn’t efficient for him. It’s one of the big reasons, why the bias of the electoral college went down by so much this cycle. Because if you look in the battleground states, things swung toward Trump maybe by like half a percentage point. And that was enough for him to win or one percentage point. But if you look at the four biggest states where immigrants are concentrated New York, California, Texas, Trump did extremely well. And so it wasn’t very efficient for him. But in terms of people changing their mind It was a massive percentage of the story. So this gets to another way that I think the data has proven conventional wisdom from at least 2020 wrong. So 2020, you have an election that Joe Biden wins. He wins by less than the polling says he will win by. And one reason he wins by less than the polling says he’ll win by, is that Donald Trump does much better with Hispanic and Asian voters than he was expected to. And I remember seeing pretty strong research afterwards and talking to people who study the Hispanic vote who were saying, well, in 2020, the pandemic really scrambled what the election was about. So in 2016, the election was about immigration. In 2020, it was about the pandemic. It was about lockdowns. It was about the economy. And so Hispanic voters who were driven off of Trump by his border talk in 2016 were more likely to vote for him in 2020. But that was weird, right. It was the pandemic, in a way, moderating Donald Trump’s appeal. 2024 Trump runs, I would say, to the right of where he was on the border in 2016, right. We’re talking mass deportations. We’re talking more than a wall. And Trump does better among immigrant groups, and he really ever has before. So the Democratic belief that when the topic turned back to immigration, you would see some of that polarization around Trump return and that he would be harmed in immigrant communities did not occur. No inflation probably played some kind of role here, though. The flip side is if you look in the UK, it happened the same year. It’s just that the incumbent was right wing instead of left wing. And their labor did also drop with black and Asian and Hindu voters. And so I think that there’s some kind of globalized right wing phenomena that’s happening. It’s hard to know exactly what, but I agree completely. Now just move on to the next slide here we have Harris support by single age year by race and gender. I found this chart a little hard to read. So can you describe to me what’s happening here. Sure so we have four lines on this chart. And the x-axis is age. And the axis is our estimate. For what fraction of people in that group voted for Kamala Harris in 2024. And we have a light blue line for women of color. We have a dark blue dashed line for men of color. We have a light pink solid line for white women, and then a dashed line for white men. And one of the things you can see here is if you just look at 18-year-olds, 18-year-old women of color are the only of the four that actually voted that Harris won. Trump narrowly won nonwhite men. So I do find this part of this chart shocking it. I sometimes talk about narrative violations. And I think if we knew anything about Donald Trump eight years ago. It’s at young people did not like him. And Republicans are maybe throwing away young people for generations in order to run up their margins among seniors. But if you look at this chart among white men who were 75 years old supported Kamala Harris at a significantly higher rate than white men who were 20 years old. That’s exactly right. That’s a real shift. It is a real shift. This is the thing I am the most shocked by. I think in the last four years, is that young people have gone from being the most progressive generation since the baby boomers, and maybe in some ways more so to becoming potentially the most conservative generation that we’ve experienced maybe in 50 to 60 years. And so the next chart, just to describe it, this chart in some ways convinced me to do this podcast. Oh Thank you. This chart shocks me. I agree, this is to me the scariest chart in this entire presentation. And again, something I’m very surprised by. In the bottom, we have age, and at the top, we have the gender gap in support between women and men and for support for Kamala Harris. And so what you can see is that for voters over 30, the gender gap was fairly stable at around 10 percent which is roughly where it’s been in American politics. For voters over 75, it’s even lower. That’s right. Fairly low gender gap among older voters. Yeah, I think that a lot of people underestimate how recent the gender gap is. Historically, Republicans did better with women than men. And this was true across most of the West that center left parties did better with men than women. And that’s changed in the United States in the Clinton era. But it’s been stable since then. But what’s crazy is if you look at people who are under the age of 30, the gender gap has exploded. If you look at 18-year-olds, 18-year-old men were 23 percentage points more likely to support Donald Trump than 18-year-old women, which is just completely unprecedented in American politics. Is that abortion. I think it’s too early to say exactly what the cause is. What’s interesting is that this is happening in other countries as well. Obviously, different countries have different political systems, but I’ve seen similar patterns in Canada, in the UK, in Norway, there’s a lot of research to do here. But it’s still very striking. A lot of people talk about the Democratic young men problem, and I think it’s still somehow underrated because the actual numbers are just a lot worse than people think. The huge gender gap implies to me, it’s not just inflation. Women pay high prices for eggs, too. And I’ll say, if you look at the UK election last year, the Labour Party did a lot better because the incumbent party was unpopular. But I think what’s interesting is that if you look at it by age, the conservatives actually increased their vote share among 18 to 24-year-old voters, I think by 2 percent or 3 percent even though they only did even though they did 8 percent or 9 percent worse overall. And so I do think it’s not just inflation. It’s not just backlash to the incumbent governments, though I’m sure that’s part of the story, too. I feel like the story you’re implying that you believe here is that this is polarization among young men and women, driven by men who are in high school, who are young, who are online, practically online during COVID as MeToo is cresting at the time of as Jordan Peterson is a big figure. Andrew Tate is rising. UVA now gets called the manosphere. But there is a sense the Democratic Party is becoming much more pro-women party. And in some ways anti young men and that just had a huge effect on young men’s political opinions. Well, I do want to just stress that this seems to be a global phenomena. And I don’t want to over center the particular things the Democratic Party has done rather than the broader cultural. Peterson and Tate are global figures. No, exactly. I agree with that. What I’ll say is I just think that we’re in the midst of a big cultural change, that I think that people are really underestimating. If you look at Zoomers, I don’t have slides on this, but there’s just a lot of really interesting ways that they’re very different in the data. They’re much more likely than previous generations to say that making money is extremely important to them. They are a lot more. If you look at their psychographic data, they have a lot higher levels of psychometric, neuroticism and anxiety than the people before them. If I was going to speculate I think that phones and social media have a lot to do with this. I think it’s very plausible to me. And I’ve heard people describe that these kids grew up looking at social media influencers as role models. But all I can say is that I think that young people today seem to have fairly different values than they did 10 years ago. How that translates into partisan politics depends on what the parties do, but I think it’s a big shift. It seems plausible to me that social media, online culture are splitting the media that young men and women get that if you are young and online and a 23-year-old man who is interested in UFC, you’re being driven into a very intensely male online world. Whereas if you are 23 years old and female and you are interested in things that the YouTube algorithm codes, that way you are not entering that world. You’re actually entering the opposite world. You’re seeing brené Brown, right. You’re seeing these other things. The capacity to be in highly gendered media worlds is really different in 2024 than it was in 2004, and that’s true worldwide. Yeah, I agree with that entirely. Online communities are way more gender segregated than offline communities are. And so in that respect, it should be unsurprising that suddenly shifting a bunch of young people’s social worlds to be entirely online all at once cause the political situation to change. So Democrats are getting destroyed now among young voters. That’s right. I do think there was. Even as the idea of the rising demographic Democratic majority had become a little discredited in 2016 and 2020. I do think Democrats believed that these young voters were eventually going to save them, that this was a last gasp of something that if Donald Trump couldn’t run these numbers up among seniors. And you had millennials really coming into their voting power, Gen Z coming in. That was going to be the end of this Republican Party. And that just completely false. Yeah, I mean, it might be the beginning of this Republican Party. I have to admit, I was one of those liberals four years ago. And it seems like I was wrong. The future has a way of surprising us. The flip side of this is that Democrats made a bunch of gains among older voters, and I’m sure that they’ll be happy that they did two years from now, two years from now in the midterms. But if we don’t do anything about this, then this problem could become very bad. So right here, I have this slide. This is very simple. This is just showing exit poll favorability for the Democratic and Republican presidential candidate in 2020 and 2024. And I think it’s just really important to ground any discussion of the election with the simple fact that Donald Trump was just as unpopular on election day last year as he was in 2020 and maybe even a little bit more unpopular. But what changed is that Biden had a net favorability rating of plus 6, and Harris had a net favorability rating of minus 6. So I want to play Mike Donilon, who was chief strategist to Joe Biden, was recently at a forum, and he made an argument that I think you at least could read this chart as backing up, which is that Biden was more popular in 2020 than Harris was in 2024. Maybe the Biden Harris switch was a mistake. Here’s Donilon. Look, I think folks who had this view believe that Biden was going to lose. He didn’t have it anymore. He had to get out. That was the best thing for the party. I understand that’s their view. But, I have a view too, right. In my view, is that really I think it was insane. I think the party lost its mind. Did the party lose its mind. And that’s why we see this chart. I think the best explanation for why Kamala Harris was unpopular is in this next slide, which is just that the Biden administration was extremely unpopular for most of its term. They saw their approval fall off a cliff after Afghanistan, and then it dropped further as inflation and immigration and the budget fights all happen in the fall. And then it never recovered. And I think the big challenge that Kamala Harris faced was just that she was seen as too close, to the Biden administration, which most voters considered to be a failure. And so, I mean, you can never tell. You can never tell a counterfactual world, but I think that Biden would have had an even harder time distinguishing himself from his record. Yeah, it would be even harder for Joe Biden to run away from Joe Biden, I guess. Yeah, looking at this chart, it looks like by January a plus 20 net disapproval. Maybe that was a little bit smaller in November, but it had been widening. I mean, you go back to the beginning of 2023, it was narrower. People were really pissed at the Biden administration, by the time we hit the election. Yeah, I think that the big salient fact about this election. And, I don’t think it was impossible for Kamala to do better. This was a winnable election. At the end of the day, it was very close. But this was the big thing, that was weighing Democrats down. And so I just want to move forward, just in terms of why, in our polling, the way that we measure issue importance is we show people two random issues and we just ask which of these problems is more important to the problems facing the country today. And people pick. And when you model it out, whenever you have cost of living or inflation put up against something else, eight or 9 out of 10 people picked that cost of living and inflation was more important. And so I think this just really shows how dominant this was. Voters were really angry about the Biden administration’s handling of inflation, of the budget deficit of crime of immigration. And I think that was just a hard thing to escape. Well, you just ticked off a bunch of issues. But what’s interesting to me about this particular bit of data is it shows that cost of living and inflation beat almost anything you put in front of it, so I agree. What I find notable here I mean Yeah, cost of living was bigger than student debt fare, but you tested it against immigration and border security and the share of voters saying cost of living or inflation was more important was about 70 percent That’s right you tested it against abortion. Their cost of living or inflation was more important to about 80 percent of voters against environment and climate change. 84 percent of voters picked cost of living inflation. One thing that the Biden people always believed was that this election would be very heavily about democracy itself. I mean, this was something that I was told by top Biden strategists going way back. I don’t see democracy on here. January 6. The stability of the system. Did you test that, too. No we did. And later we have a slide on. I mean, I’m just going to scroll down to it now since you brought it up. But we did a survey where we just asked people, what’s more important right now preserving America’s institutions or delivering change that improves people’s lives. And it was 78 to 18. Delivering change that improves people’s lives. And I’m just going to scroll up. But I think what’s really hard, I think this has been one of the hardest things about being a political consultant in the last eight years is that every day, Trump does terrible things that I think are objectively awful and scary, and it piss me off. I’m going to prosecute my enemies or whatever. And then we do a bunch of tests and voters really don’t want to hear about it. From us, I think that Trump would do better if he didn’t do that stuff. For sure. But I think that voters want us to talk about concrete ways that they’re going to improve people’s lives. There is an argument you hear from many Democrats. There was no problem here except for inflation, that, in fact, if you compare Democratic vote outcomes with incumbent parties in many other countries, Democrats did better than incumbent parties in other countries did. So you look at the conservatives in the UK, they had a much worse election result. You look at what happened to the ruling coalition in France. In some ways Democrats were doing fine. They had a fairly modest drop in support. And it’s just a shame for them that inflation happened on their watch, that if Donald Trump had won the 2020 election, inflation would have happened on his watch, completely discrediting him and his administration. And that would have been the end of them. How do you distinguish between. There is a broad structural problem the Democratic Party is facing that it needs to think about for 2028, and there’s actually no problem here. But I think I just want to go over to the next slide. When we measure issues, we measure how important voters find it. And that’s what we have in the bottom here. And then we just measure. Do you trust Democrats or Republicans more on this issue. And what you see here is if you look at the top issues that voters care the most about cost of living, the economy, taxes and government spending the deficit, foreign policy, health other than health, where Democrats have a narrow lead, Republicans have massive trust advantages 15 points on all of the issues that voters care the most about. And so the story that I would tell in response to your question is that in this election, voters trusted Republicans way more than Democrats on all of the most important issues, but also bought into this idea that Donald Trump was a terrible person who couldn’t be trusted with power. And that made the election be close. But four years from now, Donald Trump will not be the nominee, and maybe they’ll nominate somebody who’s just as terrible and just as unlikable. But if we don’t, get out of this trust deficit, I think that we’ll have a lot of problems for people listening along. This is a chart broken into quadrants. That’s right. And the top right quadrant is issues that are very important and issues where Democrats are more trusted. And it’s an untilled bit of farmland up there. That’s right. So there’s mental health, which voters don’t rate that important, but they do trust Democrats quite a bit more. They rate it higher than they rate, though. Climate change and the environment and abortion, which struck me as surprising. Mental health seems like a much bigger deal on this then you typically then I think politics reflects on either side right there. One bright spot is really health care. That’s right. That’s kind of it in terms of issues where it is quite important and they have a genuinely noticeable advantage. Yeah, I think it’s just worth saying that four years ago the number one issue was COVID and health care. And those also were the issues that people trusted Democrats the most on. And so the strategy was really obvious. Just talk a lot about COVID and health care. But this time we had a much harder problem, which was that the issues that people cared the most about for the most part, voters didn’t trust us on and the issues that people did trust us on climate change, and reproductive rights, probably the big ones voters just didn’t care very much about. And so that was just a very difficult strategic position. And it’s also one that was just very different than it was four years ago. All right. I just want to tick off some issues voters ranked as important that they trusted Republicans on and then ask you a question about it. So they thought. Cost of living, the economy and inflation were very important. Had a lot more trust in Republicans. They thought national security and foreign policy were important. Trusted Republicans, taxes. Government spending. Government debt. Trusted Republicans. Crime immigration. Trusted Republicans. Social Security. Trusted Republicans. That seems like a bad one for Democrats, a political division they thought was important. They trusted Republicans. A bit more on that in this data. If I looked over time, if I looked at 2016 and I looked at 2020, would I see on all of these that Republicans had advantages and Democrats were just winning on health care. How much of this is something flipping around as an incumbent penalty and reaction to conditions in the country at that moment, and how much of it is a durable situation where Republicans have a trust advantage, where Democrats would have to act in a spectacular way over time to change voters impressions of them on that issue. What we saw in our data was that as the Biden administration became a lot more unpopular all of these things dropped a lot. So some of it was uniform shift. But I think that the last four years, there were some things that structurally changed a lot in every center left party in the world. Generally the left has its issues that it owns and the right has its issues that it owns. But usually the economy is pretty neutral. During the Trump administration, the economy was fairly neutral. And in 2020, I think if you looked at this and even in 2021, it really didn’t look anything like this. Another really big shift was just that education has gone from being basically one of the best issues for Democrats to being something that’s basically neutral now. And we saw that in the Virginia gubernatorial election in 2021, we even saw it be an advantage for Republicans. And then the other big shift in the other side was that reproductive rights used to be a fairly neutral issue for Democrats like in general. When you talked about it in the pre Dobbs era, it wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t something that changed a lot of oats. And immediately after Dobbs, we saw a party trust on reproductive rights shoot up. And so I think these numbers they do change. And this is one of the big messages I want to get through is just that, the world has changed a lot in the last four years. It’s going to keep changing. And we have to adjust in response to what happens. All right. So this tell me what’s going on in this next slide. Because I also, as I understand this is really very connected to the work you do specifically. So what are you doing here. All right. So one of the big things that my firm does, it’s probably our biggest product is that we do randomized controlled trials on ads. This is something that both parties do. This is pretty standard. But the idea is that for a given ad, you take 1,000 people split them into a treatment and control group. 500 people see the ad, 500 people don’t. And then you survey them after. And you see, ask them who they’re voting for. And then the difference between treatment and control can be described as the causal effect of if you see this ad, this is the effect it will have on your chance of voting for them. And so we tested on the order of I’d say probably like four or $5,000 Harris ads last cycle. And I just wanted to call out these two ads that were in the top 1 percent of ads that we tested. One is from Kamala Harris. I get it. The cost of rent, groceries and utilities is too high. So here’s what we’re going to do about it. We will lower housing costs by building more homes and crack down on landlords who are charging too much. We will lower your food and grocery bills by going after price gougers who are keeping the cost of everyday goods too high. I’m Kamala Harris and I approve this message because you work hard for your paycheck, you should get to keep more of it. As president, I’ll make that my top priority. Obviously, there’s a lot for several parts of the Democratic coalition there. Another ad by future forward shows attacks him for a national sales tax for the idea that Trump’s tax him being Trump. Yeah attacks Trump. He fights for himself and his billionaire friends. He intends to enact a national sales tax. The Trump tax that would raise prices on middle class families by $4,000 a year. Instead of a tax hike, we will pass a middle class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans. As attack is responsible for the content of this ad, these were obviously the best ads in the campaign. And the point, I just want to say is, I think this reinforces the point that what voters cared the most about was the cost of living, and that voters were really mad about the actual situation. And I think that Harris being able to in this ad acknowledging oh, things are actually very bad. I don’t like this. I have a plan to fix. This is part of what made it so effective. There is a view out there. I saw Jacobin had just done some research on this, which is a socialist publication that at the beginning of the Harris campaign, sprint, I mean, she was only the head of the Democratic ticket for three months. She was talking a lot about the economy and that by the end, she was talking a lot about democracy, that there had been a change in the nature of the campaign, the ads it was running, how they were messaging. Their big closing argument was that the ellipses in Washington, DC, which is where the January 6 riots, in a way, began that there was phases of the Harris campaign, and the first one was more populist and the last one was more institutional. From what you saw, was that true. I think that there was this big strategic question that Democrats faced. And it wasn’t just the Harris campaign, which is polling would tell them you should talk about the economy, or voters care a lot about the cost of living. But it’s very hard, one to get media attention on those things. And two, I think that Trump has done a good job of baiting us. I think what’s really interesting about a lot of the democracy and authoritarian stuff is just that how concerned you are by it really varies a lot by political engagement and by education and the kind of people who set media decisions at CNN or who work in politics are the kinds of people who are going to be much more concerned about it, than working class folks are. And so I think that but but look, there is a difference between the Harris campaign was running the optimal David Shor strategy in late October of 2024, and they were not. The Harris campaign had access future before it had access to all of this issue by issue polling. They had access to all this randomized ad testing. Did they run a heavily economic campaign and it didn’t work, or did they not run a heavily economic campaign at the end. And it didn’t work, because, look, if they did the thing and it didn’t work, then maybe it just didn’t work. Did they not do it. Yeah, I mean, asking the hard questions. But yeah, I think obviously, I think that Democratic messaging last cycle was not economically focused enough. I think that it focused too much on narratives of defending institutions, defending democracy. And I think it’s just very easy, for folks to fall into that trap. But I really don’t. But why. If they did that and I heard this from different people. David Plouffe is a smart guy. I’m not telling you to. I’m not asking you to critique David Plouffe. I can watch you getting physically uncomfortable as I. As I harm your business here. right, right. But these people all wanted to win. They really did. Every single one of them. And they had a lot of data. So I think this has been a thing on my mind. If they weren’t running the optimal strategy, why. I know it’s hard to get media attention for things, and that’s fair enough. But it’s also not impossible to get media attention for things right. For instance, it’s very easy to get media attention for anti-price gouging policies because there’s a lot of controversy over them about whether or not they worked. But they did make people talk about whether or not you were going to do an anti-price gouging policy. This is a Donald Trump move, constantly announce a policy that probably doesn’t work, or is in some way outrageous or beyond the bounds of political possibility, maybe isn’t even all that popular when you poll, but you get people talking about you having a very strong view. You’re going to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. Everybody knows Mexico isn’t going to pay for it. But you are talking about how Donald Trump hates immigration. And it breaks through. It is not rocket science to get people to pay attention. If Bernie Sanders had been running in the campaign, people would have paid attention to his economic messaging because he does economic messaging that creates conflict. If it was really this big delta between the economic push and the institutions push, and the institutions push is what got made, or at least got made more than 1, it should have. Why the thing I’ll say, in terms of why I’m sympathetic to the people who actually had these jobs and had to make these decisions, is it just feels wrong. I have a situation, I mentioned this before where donors will email me and they’ll be like Oh, look at this crazy, absolutely terrible thing, this evil thing that Trump is doing. We need to test it. We need to tell the voters, can you test it. And it really doesn’t work. People want to hear about eggs. And it’s easy for me to say that, because I don’t really I’m not directly in charge. But I just think it just feels really wrong when you’re in the moment. It’s just it’s very hard to totally shift direction, just because data tells you one thing. I do think the campaign photo ops that we all remember at the end are telling, which is it was an extraordinary visual. Harris at the Ellipse. And then there were the visuals of Donald Trump in a garbage truck and Donald Trump at McDonald’s. And there was a Ridiculousness to those visuals. I saw a lot of liberals making fun of them on various social media platforms, but there was something about which visuals are being chosen by the two candidates. I mean, of the two of them, only Kamala Harris had actually worked at a McDonald’s. Sure, but she wasn’t the one who ended up like putting on the apron and getting photographed at McDonald’s. And there’s a thing about what the candidates end up wanting to do that is meaningful to. And I do think there’s a way in which I wonder if that explains part of what we ended up seeing. Each coalitions campaigns are ultimately going to reflect the aesthetic and cultural choices of the people who staff them. And, it makes sense. If you had just said two years ago, Trump’s going to end by showing up at a McDonald’s. Like, it just wouldn’t have been surprising, I think. And so it’s just hard to escape, that kind of demographic pull. But we have to try because we have to actually win these people over. And so now I just have I have a couple more slides I want to go through. I talked about this before, but voters cared a lot more about delivering change than preserving institutions. And then we have this other polling question here, which I think is interesting, which is just asking people to pick between the statements. Things could be going better in America, but what we need is a return to basic stability. And the other is things in America are going poorly, and what’s needed is a major change and a shock to the system. And when you have those two things, it’s 53, 37, which is a lot wider than the election result ended up being. What really strikes me about this is that sometimes I read polls, and the wording is pretty clearly there to make something sound better than the other thing. Things could be going better in America, and what is needed is return to basic stability from whoever becomes president. And things in America are going poorly, and what is needed is a major change and a shock to the system from whoever becomes president. I would in some ways say the second there is worded to turn people off a little bit, it sounds disruptive crisis, a shock. It’s not just major change. It is something beyond that. And it dominates, I guess, though, I have a question about this, which is on the one hand, we see lines like that outpolling the incremental change everywhere. On the other hand, if you look at the New split ticket ratings for who overperformed in the election. Very moderate. House Democrats did very well. Totally there does seem to me to be a tension between two forms of political wisdom that both have data behind them right now. Which is that voters want huge, massive change. And the optimal political strategy is Joe Manchin or Jared Golden or Ruben Gallego, who are actually not. Or Susan Collins, who are not people who promise unbelievably shocking change. They are moderates who kind of tack between the parties a little bit and try to represent a center that wants something a little bit less dramatic than either side is offering. How do you reconcile them. There’s an enormous amount of status quo bias in politics. Campaigning on big policy changes can be pretty unpopular. But I think the way to thread the needle, what this is really saying is that voters were very angry about the state of things, and what they wanted tonally was someone who acknowledged that anger because Ruben and Gallego did a lot of criticism of the status quo and was able to outperform. So people on an angry moderate. That’s right. I think that’s exactly right. Like they want not AI always think of temperament and ideology as being separate axes in American politics that we connect too much. So we think about people who are moderates often have the moderate temperament. Susan Collins is like the great example, the joke always of the Susan Collins meter from somewhat concerned all the way to very concerned being the red line for her. You have a lot of moderates who by nature they’re pretty chill. They try to be civil. What this is implying is what people want are moderate policies in a more revolutionary or certainly more upset temperament. Yeah, we’re pissed, but not ideologically extreme about it. It’s like a funny chant. But when people think about moderates, they think of somebody like Joe Manchin, someone who’s just like down the line on everything. And the reality. I think that an accurate description of what highly educated moderates are like. But most low socioeconomic status moderates actually have fairly incoherent views. They’re liberal on some issues. They’re very conservative on other issues. And I think that that’s just like a much closer fit. For And that’s when you think of that, it’s maybe less surprising that a lot of them Donald Trump back in 2016, I wrote a piece about Donald Trump that has one of these headlines that now people will sometimes screenshot and be mad at me about but it’s called something like Donald Trump is a perfect moderate. And the point of the piece was not that he’s not extreme, because I think he is extreme, but that the way his politics worked, practically on the campaign trail in things he said, was that it was internally disorganized, so he’d be extremely Right on immigration. But compared to other Republicans, much more centrist on things like Medicare and Social Security. He would talk about giving health care to everybody, even though Republicans wouldn’t like that. He talked about raising taxes on people like him, not how he governed. But there’s a lot of research that actual moderates, people in the elected who are moderate. It’s not that they have in between the two parties view on everything, it’s that they might believe in completely legalized weed, on the one hand, and mass deportations on the other, that it’s like if you imagine positions as being they can be very liberal or very conservative. They average out to moderate as opposed to being consistently moderate. That’s exactly right. And the way I like to put that in math terms, the issue correlations for highly educated people are just a lot higher than they are. Your eyebrows get excited when you do math terms. Yeah no. I’m sorry. It’s all right. But I’m glad we started talking about ideology because that dovetails to the next slide. Here we just ask for each of the candidates. Do you think this candidate was more liberal than me, more conservative than me, or close to my views. So when you look at this slide, what you see is that 49 percent of voters said that Kamala Harris was more liberal than me, while only 39 percent of voters said that Donald Trump was more conservative than me. And so there was this big ideological perception gap where a lot of voters saw Donald Trump as more as more moderate than Kamala Harris. What did this look like in 2016 and 2020? So in 2016, it looked fairly similar to this. In 2020, perceptions of Donald Trump being too extreme went up relative to 2016, and perceptions of the Democratic candidate being too extreme went down from 2016 to 2020. Now that I think wasn’t a property of Joe Biden per se. Like, him being moderate was a big part of his brand at that time. But in our polling, we would ask, do you think that Joe Biden is too liberal or too conservative or whatever. And we saw that over the course of 2021, as his approval ratings dipped, the perception that he was too liberal also went up. Well, it’s also true that Joe Biden became more liberal like in terms of how he governed and in terms of what he ran on. So you’re saying that in the 2020 election, you actually did see people say that they were ideologically closer to Biden than to Trump. Yes And then over time, that eroded, that eroded. The thing I want to say here before I move on is I’m really not trying to beat up on Kamala Harris here. I think if you just step back, if you have a situation where the Democratic Party, where only 42 percent of Americans trust the Democratic Party on the economy relative to 58 for Republicans. Obviously, the standard bearer of the Democratic Party is going to be perceived as too left wing unless they unless they do a lot of stuff to try to counterbalance that. I mean, people were living under the biden-harris administration, whatever they thought of it. The line Trump would sometimes deliver on Harris, which in many ways is unfair if you’re a super politically engaged voter and you have a lot of thoughts about the powers of the vice presidency. But to most people, if you have all these great ideas, why don’t you do them. In the last four years, while your vice president was a pretty strong argument. I think there’s a good argument that given that, it’s amazing that we did as well as we did. But it was a close election. And so who knows what the counterfactual could have been. I want to note something as a dog that is not barking across this presentation. Yeah since the election, I think that if you look at what Donald Trump is doing, what Elon Musk is doing, and if you look at punditry about the election, that if everybody agrees on anything, it’s that the election was a huge verdict on wokeness. Famously, one of Trump’s higher testing ads was this Kamala Harris is her they/them Donald Trump is for you as you’re running through this. I’m not saying you’re saying DEI programs are popular, but I’m not seeing it emerge as a major explanation for 2024 here. I’m curious how you both think about it in the election and think about the role that’s playing in the post-election narrative. I just want to say, they/them ad that everybody talks about it was a good ad, but it was like a 70th percentile ad. In our testing, if you look at all of the best testing ads from Donald Trump, it was basically the economy. It was gas prices, it was immigration, it was crime. And so I think that there’s definitely been an overfocus on die, on wokeness, on trans issues. I think it definitely played a role on the elite discourse and why so many tech CEOs have become more right wing. And all of that. But I think that the voters were really mad about inflation and crime and immigration and the budget deficit. And I think the Republicans are making a mistake, honestly, to focus on these things. So much relative to concrete issues that people actually care about. I think that there’s this bigger picture point I want to make where I think that a lot of people see the Trump administration as kind of a break that shows that all of the traditional rules of politics, no longer apply. And I think to some extent that’s wrong, that a lot of what’s happening is really very easy to understand. Donald Trump, to go back to the ideological thing he broke with his party. He might have been dishonest about it, but he disavowed Project 2025. He said that he wouldn’t cut Social programs, he ruled out a national abortion ban. And I think that kind of thing just plays a big role in his success. And I think that a lot of these newer things that we talk about might be less important than we think. But the flip side is it’s possible that when it comes to something like, why is it that 20-year-old men are so much more conservative than they were four years ago. I could believe maybe wokeness has something to do with that, but I think that the bulk of this is traditional factors. So now I just have the last slide of the retrospective. What I have here is we have the share of voters who get their news from TikTok by year, the share of voters who get their news of young voters, who get their news from TikTok more than quadrupled in the last four years. This is the biggest and probably fastest change in media consumption. That has happened in my lifetime and it was quite correlated with support change. Now, obviously TikTok users are younger, they’re less politically engaged. It’s not surprising that we dropped among this group. You’d expect that from demographics. But if you go and you do the regressions, I think there was definitely a causal element there. And when you Zoom in, particularly to people who get their news from TikTok who don’t care very much about politics, this is a group that’s eight percentage points more Republican than they were four years ago. And that’s a lot. So by the end of the election, Donald Trump is promising to save TikTok. One possible explanation, then, for TikTok users shifting towards Trump is that they like TikTok, and they didn’t want it to be taken away from them. Another, which people have worried about quite a bit, is that the company behind TikTok could very easily have been turning dials just softly. It’s not that nothing that is liberal does well on TikTok. I’ve seen videos of me get posted there and do very well on TikTok, but that it would not be hard to turn up the dial a little bit on issues that are tricky for Democrats. On people complaining about the cost of living on pro-trump influencers. If everybody who the algorithm codes is, pro-trump gets a 7 percent boost. That is pretty that will not be obvious exactly on the app, but could be very, very meaningful in the aggregate when you look at this data. Do you think it is something about TikTok. Do you think it is something about TikTok’s audience just being young people who are seeing this movement. Or does it make you suspect dial turning. I don’t know the answer to that. It’s totally possible. Like, we know that they do. Dial turning on some topics, stuff like Ukraine or Tiananmen Square or whatever. But what I’ll say is, I think that TikTok represents something fairly radically different than social networks that came before it. And I’m sure you know that there could be some malfeasance on the part of people who work there. But the thing that I think about sometimes is just that. I think TikTok is really the first social media platform that is really, truly decentralized. Like if you. And what I mean by that is just it’s not based on follower graphs. Like if you look at reels or Twitter or whatever, how many people see a video or a piece of content is highly correlated with how many followers that person has. TikTok’s a lot more random, and there’s very interesting machine learning reasons for why but I think that it really allowed a lot of content that never would have gotten a lot of views on Twitter or on television to suddenly escape containment and get directly into the eyes of people who don’t care that much about politics. And, I don’t could tell a story that maybe just anti-incumbent stuff is going to do really well on TikTok and Democrats are going to do great. Now, I don’t really know. But I think that for whatever reason, this big change I think really did help Republicans. And it’s just an example of how the world has really changed a lot. So I know that you’re near Democratic both freak out and funding world. I hear a lot from Democrats about how to fix what they now call their media problem. Or sometimes you hear the TikTok problem, maybe pay try to seed creators and give them some support. When you look at this, do you think this is something that an established political party and a bunch of donors can do something about. Or do you think this is a TikTok is a vibes machine. And basically for reasons of inflation, for reasons of incumbency, for reasons of censorious Democratic Party that people got tired of the vibes are bad for Democrats in 2024, and vibes machines like TikTok some of the other social media things, they’re going to be an amplifier of bad vibes. So it’s not really a thing to do in the sense of strategy. What you’re trying to do is be culturally, both in terms of the candidates you have and the actual things you say and believe. Culturally a better product, and then the things that pick up good cultural products and amplify them are going to be friendlier to you. I think there’s a lot of truth in that. I think that TikTok is genuinely strange relative to platforms before it, in that its audience is more politically disengaged and more working class, and I think it’s just been very hard for us as a party to find creators and content that appeals to people like that because all of the people who work in Democratic politics are not like that. And I think that in the old traditional media world, we were a lot like the media gatekeepers. And so it was kind of clear how to win that war. And I think Democrats did a good job of doing it. But now we have a totally different fight. So just to move on and talk a little bit about the present as opposed to the long, long time ago of four or five months ago. So, you’ve talked a lot in your previous episodes about Trump’s flood the zone strategy, where he’s just constantly doing a bunch of stuff. And what we’ve done here is we’ve pulled all his executive orders and stuff that he’s campaigned on. I think we have something like 60, 60 dots here. Every one of these dots is a policy that we’ve pulled. And what you can see is that there’s a lot of variance. A lot of the things that he campaigned on no taxes on tips, deploying the military to the border. Voter ID laws, ending remote work for federal employees. A lot of that stuff is very popular. While the flip side is a lot of stuff that he’s actually doing. He talks about this stuff less, but Medicaid cuts, repealing the Aca, extending tax cuts to billionaires, a lot of that stuff is really unpopular. Just to say something a little controversial. I think a lot of the challenge of the Trump era is that they’re going to try to bait us we should do everything we can to actually meaningfully resist and protect populations that we care about and everything. But I think we need to make sure that we’re preserving a considerable amount of time, to attacking Trump on the most effective things that voters are concerned about. You used the term bait a few times. Yeah they’re going to try to bait us. I think of a political party baiting you as dangling something in front of you that they know is going to make you mad, but it isn’t that big of a deal. They’re doing mass firings around critical functions. They’re destroying USAID. They’re aggregating huge amount of executive power. The set of things that I find Democrats are really worried about at the moment. It’s on the one hand, I suspect they’re not the things that the public cares about wants to hear that much about making a podcast or the deputy director of the FBI. But at the same time, they’re not baiting. They’re real. They’re important. Like what is the point of a party that will not fight those. And this is a place where I think there is a tension between this focus on what’s popular. Don’t focus on just the things that activate your high education, high income base. But in terms of getting people out into the streets, potentially, if you need that, getting people to town halls, there’s sometimes I think this thought of the party is just going to I mean, James carville’s been saying Democrats should basically play dead for a while and wait until the Trump administration’s unpopular actions destroy the Trump administration, but don’t get in the way. Or there’s this version of a party that various things Hakeem Jeffries has said at different points have sounded like this to people, I think is thinking is a little bit more complicated than this. But we’re not going to run after all these things. We’re going to focus on the price of eggs, the price of goods. You can really lose your own base if you’re not defending democracy. When they care about democracy because you’re waiting for an opportunity to attack prices, when prices are going to do what prices are going to do. What Democrats say about prices isn’t the most salient thing. Am I getting what you’re saying right. Is there a way of threading the needle. How do you think about that. Yeah, I think you could imagine a theoretical world where we would have really hard and unpleasant trade offs. But I think the world we actually live in is that a bunch of the things that we’re extremely concerned about are actually really unpopular. And just kind of going forward to the next slide. Here’s some randomized control trial data that we did that I was talking about earlier with the ads, where we just kind of went through. And we looked at 58 different things that Trump’s going to do. And then we rank ordered them by how persuasive they were at actually changing people’s votes and making people disapprove of Trump. And I think that a lot of the things that we’re most concerned about Ellen, causing chaos in the federal government cuts to Medicaid and Medicare and Social Security, extending tax breaks for the rich. I obviously this list of things is not exactly the same as my top five things that I am personally most concerned about with the Trump administration. But I think that the Republicans are making a lot of unforced errors that make it easier to thread the needle on these things than I think it otherwise would be true. But these are also pretty small changes in Trump disapproval if I’m reading what this chart is. If Democrats attack Trump for cutting Medicare and Social Security or wanting to cut Medicare and Social Security, that increases Trump disapproval by 2.5 points. If they attack him for letting Ellen budgets, hurting Americans and putting privacy at risk, that hurts him by 2.2 points. Going down. Passing a one party power grab to cut government services without compromise. That’s 2.1 points. These kind of all look the same, and none of them are very big. Can you just like, think for a second like this is like, can you imagine 70 words you like, stop a Trump voter on the street and you say the 70 words to him, and then there’s a 2.2 5 percent chance he changed his mind. I think that’s incredible. I just think that these two pieces of data tell a story of how we should try to shape the campaign against Trump in the next couple of months, which is that he is wrecking havoc in the federal government. I think that is consistent with our principles and also something that voters are very concerned about. That he is trying to support for the safety net and that he’s trying to do tax cuts against the wealthy. And I think that a lot of this critique of Trump is really very similar to the campaign that we ran against Mitt Romney. And I think that this kind of gets back to what I was saying before of I feel like, we were so shocked by Trump that we kind of forgot that the old rules of politics. I want to read two of these because I think something you just said is important when we’re talking about these old laws of politics. So here, here’s these are all high polling, high testing messages. But this is the lowest one on the chart. So Trump is working to repeal a law that lowers the cost of health and prescription drug costs and caps insulin costs at 35 a month for seniors. By repealing this law, Trump will increase the cost of life saving medicine for millions and create more financial strain when costs are already too high. So that increases Trump disapproval by 1.9 points. I think that is as right down the middle, a Democratic message as you could possibly imagine that does not test as well as Trump is letting Elon Musk federal budgets with no oversight, checks or balances. Musk gave $250 million to Trump’s campaign, and now Trump is letting Musk reshape the government in ways that advance Musk’s interests, even if they hurt working Americans by cutting the basics like Medicaid and public schools. I am actually surprised that the Elon Musk is out attack is outpolling the insulin attack. And it’s interesting because I see this in Trump voters in my own life right there. Some of the ones I they’re actually not happy with what’s going on in the Trump administration. There’s a lot they don’t like. There’s a lot going on, but too much. But Musk creeps them out. Is that in your data. I think it’s really telling that Elon stuff floats to the top here because it’s really very hard for something to be competitive with, protect Social Security and Medicare. The fact that there are multiple Elon things up at the top, I think, really does tell a story that there’s something really unusual about what he’s doing. It’s very easy to tie what he’s doing to harming individual people. In ads, one of the clearest patterns in ads is that getting a real person and just having them stare at a camera and talk about the ways that Republicans have personally hurt them, it’s the best content. It’s funny, if you hire actors, it doesn’t work as well. People have tried. And that’s why in some ways, I’m optimistic that Democrats will be able to thread the coalitional needle here because we should like the two things that we should do is fight against social welfare cuts and also attack Elon Musk for the chaos he’s creating. And I think that that’s something that basically every wing of the party should be on board with. Donald Trump is polling better than he was at this point in his first term. And the vibes have really shifted in pro-trump direction. And look at how much he and Elon Musk are doing. And, I’ve certainly talked to Republicans who have this feeling that Trump has unlocked a political juggernaut here, that he has cracked the code of American politics. But you have this. This slide is titled Trump is vulnerable. So why is he vulnerable. Well the first thing you see is that he has been getting more unpopular rapidly as time has gone on. And I just think the most predictable thing in American politics, and we get surprised every single time it happens is the president comes in, he wins a trifecta, and then he does a bunch of unpopular stuff. He overreaches, and then he becomes very unpopular and loses big in the midterms. That doesn’t mean that you can’t avoid the cycle. But I think that in order to avoid it, when you look at the people who did the best job, Clinton in 1998 or Kennedy in 1962 they did it by engaging in an enormous amount of policy restraint. And that is just not what Trump has been doing at all. And I think that you can just see in the data. But his approval rating is dropping pretty quickly, and you can see that he’s just pissing off lots of people and that the stuff that a lot of the stuff that he’s doing and drawing attention toward is really quite unpopular. There’s also this reality of the coalitional realignment you were talking about at the beginning, which is Democrats now have this higher information, higher engagement coalition. Those are the people who turn out to midterms disproportionately. If I were a moderate Republican right now or a Republican in any way vulnerable, I know they’re all afraid of Elon Musk and they’re afraid of primaries. I’d be pretty afraid of losing, because it’s not just that you tend to have thermostatic midterm elections, but that the coalitions have been changing such that Democrats are able to survive the 2022 midterm, which should have gone against them. And I think Dobbs saved them to some degree. But also the fact that their coalition was as you showed earlier. If only 20, 22 voters had come out in 2024, Harris would have won. You got to be pretty confident in Donald Trump’s political skills to think that he is going to shift that dynamic. It seems that in addition to all the normal things that happens to presidents and midterms, the shape of the coalition makes midterms harder right now for Republicans. Yeah, I think that’s exactly right. But that said, it gets to this tension in all of these Democratic soul searching conversations, which is if Democrats do nothing really like, they’ll probably be O.K in 2026 because all of these voters, who get their news from TikTok, who don’t care about politics, these voters under 25, they just really are not going to vote very much in the midterms. But if we don’t fix this problem, then four years from now, we could be in the same trust deficit on all of these core issues. And these voters that didn’t turn out in 2026 will come back. And except we’ll be running against a candidate who’s a lot less unpopular, potentially, than Trump. And we could be in a real problem, a real, real pickle. How about the Senate. So you and I did a big piece on debates about populism a couple years ago, involved a model that you had, and that model was predicting in 2022, but specifically 2024 Democratic Senate annihilation. And Democrats are down a couple of seats in the Senate. It’s what is it, 5347 right. It’s not a good map for them in 2026. And they did lose some seats that were really important to them tester and Montana and Brown in Ohio. How do you see the Democratic Senate future. If you had told me in 2019, when I started worrying about the 2024 Senate election, that we would have 47 seats, I would have jumped for joining me. I think the really big factors there is they Republicans ran a bunch of really terrible candidates in a bunch of swing races. And it turns out Democrats, those Democratic candidates, did a good job of distancing themselves from the party. I don’t want to spend too much time speculating about the 2026 map, but I think that even though the bias in the electoral college has gone down quite a bit because of this swing among immigrants that doesn’t really change that. The Senate, it’s very hard for Democrats to take the Senate unless they can consistently outperform how Harris did and how Biden did in most of the country. These problems won’t be fixed unless we spend the next two years or four years, changing the party’s brand among working class voters who are overrepresented in the Senate. The one exception to this, I think and this is just controversial and might get me in trouble is I think that I’m just going to scroll up back to the Senate side. If you look in Nebraska, the single biggest overperformance that we had was Osborne running as an independent. He outperformed at the top of the ticket by 7.1 percent Now obviously, Nebraska is an extremely red state. And I think that we’ve only ever tried this strategy of running people who are literally formally not tied to the Democratic Party in extremely red states. But I think the argument for doing that kind of thing in an merely red states, in places like Florida or places like Ohio or Iowa. Those are hard questions. And it’s not up to me, what we end up doing, but I think it’s something that we have to really seriously consider. And then that also just brings up the really awkward point of like, well, what do we do with the reality that in most by land area, in most parts of the country, it’s almost impossible for a Democrat or someone with a Democrat on their ticket to win. What do you do about the reality of the Democratic brand is toxic in. Yeah most of the land area in the country, because I think you can have this conversation that you always have to be careful about which conversation you’re having is a conversation. Can Democrats win in 2026 or 2028? And the answer there is Yes. If the conversation is how do you get back to a place where you’re putting states in play that Democrats have just kind of given up on. Mitch McConnell is retiring in Kentucky. There’s a Democratic Governor in Kentucky. It’s not literally true that no Democrat can ever win there. I don’t think anybody seriously thinks so that a Democrat is going to win Mitch McConnell’s seat, because the Democratic brand nationally, which is different than it’s kind of state party brand, is pretty bad. And people understand when they’re voting for Senate, they’re voting for the National brand. So you been thinking about this for a long time. If you were trying to think about reversing these much deeper trends, right. These educational trends, this realignment that has. If your whole point in life was to make Democrats competitive again in Florida, in Missouri, in Kansas. Not the reddest states, but states that they were competitive in a couple of years ago. What would you advise Democrats to do. The reality of the situation right now, I think there are these big theoretical discussions we could have about what positions the Democrats could take. Is that Democrats are not in power right now. And so we don’t have agenda control. And I think a lot of this just depends on what Trump does and what. And then who replaces Trump. Something I’ll say going back to the 2016 the first time that Trump was president is that when we were looking at polling of non-college whites and these obama-trump voters, their approval rating for Trump was really very stable for most of his term. And the only time that it declined was when Trump tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And then we saw them revert to their old partisanship. But once that was out of the news, they switched back. And so I think that does kind of like at this moment, given that there is no party leader. I think it’s mostly a question of if Trump does successfully push a bunch of welfare state cuts, then that might change the realignment. But I think realistically, at least until 2026, it’s mostly a function of what Republicans do. But when we pick a new presidential candidate that will be a that will be a reset. And I think I don’t think it’s too early to talk about that, but I think that could imagine us picking candidates who would do a much better job. I think that is a good place to end. So always our final question. What are three books you would recommend to the audience. I’d say the three books for me, I want to call out hollow parties by Danny Salzman. He’s a good friend of mine, and I think it’s. And Sam rosenfelt and Sam Rosenfeld, of course, my old colleague. Yes I think it’s hard to talk about a lot of these questions that I was kind of dodging about why parties were doing what they did without kind of reading that. The other thing I want to call out is something that was hugely influential for how I think about politics is a really nerdy pick, but the origin and nature of mass opinion by Xolair. It gets at this question of how much does what people say in surveys matter versus how much of it is downstream of what people are saying what elites are saying. And I think his answer is mostly elites, but both. And then the last thing I just wanted to call out was a victory lap by Sasha Eisenberg. It kind of talks a lot about the history of the Democratic analytics industry. A lot of the stuff that these numbers that I’ve shared here come out of that machine. And so if you’re just interested in the history of the Democratic party’s internal analytics and research structure, it’s the only book really that’s ever been written about it. David Shor, Thank you very much. Thank you.",

        "full_text": "President Trump cloaked himself in core national security powers Monday as his attorneys told federal courts to butt out while he deports suspected gang members.\n\nThe administration, over the weekend, sent nearly 250 Venezuelans purported to be members of the Tren de Aragua gang to El Salvador, drawing scrutiny from a federal judge who had ordered the planes to be turned around and from immigrant rights defenders who said Mr. Trump was trampling on fundamental constitutional rights.\n\nThe Justice Department said Mr. Trump had declared Tren de Aragua as a terrorist organization and was acting under his powers as commander in chief and the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 when he ousted the suspected gang members.\n\nDeputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign asked a federal appeals court to step in and derail the judicial inquiry and take Judge James Boasberg off the case. He said Judge Boasberg was allowing terrorists to mount a class-action lawsuit without heeding national security.\n\n“The district court’s hasty public inquiry into these sensitive national security matters — with no contemplated protections against disclosure of operational details — underscores the urgency of immediate relief from this court, including an immediate administrative stay,” Mr. Ensign said in a filing asking Judge Boasberg be kicked off the case.\n\nThe fight goes to the heart of Mr. Trump’s biggest claims of his second term, including that his national security powers are virtually unfettered, that the country has seen an “invasion” of illegal immigrants, and the result has been a border emergency and an influx of terrorists in the form of cartel and transnational gang activity.\n\nSEE ALSO: Justice Dept. cites Trump’s commander-in-chief powers to defend deportations to El Salvador\n\nIn a hearing Monday, Judge Boasberg grilled the government’s attorneys, demanding to know the timing of the administration’s actions and whether they ignored his oral instructions.\n\nTwo planes appear to have been in the air during his hearing Saturday. Another seems to have departed the U.S. airport after the hearing. It’s unclear whether it left before the judge issued a written order.\n\nJudge Boasberg wanted to know whether any people he was trying to block from deportation were on that third flight and said he wanted the information fast.\n\nHe asked how many potential targets there are for deportation under the Alien Enemies Act and asked the administration to say whether it would reveal particulars about the flights and their timing.\n\n“If the government takes the position that it will not provide that information to the court under any circumstances, it must support such position, including with classified authorities if necessary,” he wrote in an order Monday night.\n\nHe gave the administration a deadline of noon Tuesday and told them they could file part of their answers under seal if necessary.\n\nHe is the latest judge to sharply question the veracity of Trump administration claims amid a flurry of lawsuits challenging the president’s executive actions.\n\nSalvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who is being paid about $20,000 per person per year to hold Tren de Aragua members in his Terrorism Confinement Center, mocked Judge Boasberg’s order.\n\n“Oopsie… Too late,” he posted to social media with a laughing emoji. The post was promoted by Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nHe released a video of his new guests, showing men being manhandled off the plane, having their hair and beards shorn off, dressed in white T-shirts, white undershorts and white sandals, shackled and taken to cells.\n\nMr. Bukele said the deal was good for all sides.\n\n“The United States will pay a very low fee for them, but a high one for us,” he said. He also said the MS-13 deportees on the flights would help his own country, where the gang has been based, to root out the gang’s money, weapons, drugs and collaborators.\n\nJudge Boasberg, an Obama appointee to the district court in Washington, quickly became a target of conservative outrage.\n\nA House Republican said over the weekend that he would introduce articles of impeachment to try to remove the judge.\n\nThe White House has embraced the fight over deportations, believing it has strong legal and political ground.\n\n“There were violent criminals and rapists in our country. Democrats fought to keep them here. President Trump deported them,” said Vice President J.D. Vance.\n\nTom Homan, Mr. Trump’s border czar and head of his deportation agency in the first Trump administration, said the U.S. ousted 238 members of the Tren de Aragua gang, based in Venezuela, and sent 21 MS-13 gang members to El Salvador.\n\n“With each criminal illegal alien being deported, neighborhoods are becoming safer,” he said.\n\nCongressional Democrats were far less excited about the way the situation is playing out. They accused Mr. Trump of violating the deportees’ “due process” rights.\n\n“This attempt to use an archaic wartime law — not used since World War II — for immigration enforcement is yet another unlawful and brazen power grab,” said a joint statement by Sens. Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, Alex Padilla of California, Cory A. Booker of New Jersey and Peter Welch of Vermont.\n\nThey said the U.S. is “not at war, and immigrants are not invading our country,” so there is no justification for using the 1798 law.\n\nThey said the danger is Mr. Trump will deport U.S. citizens “or people who haven’t committed a crime.”\n\nJudge Boasberg isn’t the first to order a deportation flight to turn around.\n\nIn 2018, in the wake of Mr. Trump’s attempt to stiffen asylum standards, Judge Emmet G. Sullivan ordered a plane headed for El Salvador to be returned and threatened contempt of court on U.S. officials who defied him.\n\nThe flight wasn’t turned around, but a mother and child who were the plaintiffs in a case before Judge Sullivan were kept on the plane as it flew back to the U.S.\n\nThe Tren de Aragua deportees aren’t the only case testing Mr. Trump’s powers.\n\nA Lebanese doctor was blocked by Customs and Border Protection officers as she tried to enter the U.S. on a guest worker visa last week.\n\nDr. Rasha Alawieh has been working in the U.S. for years on an H-1B visitor’s visa and is a professor at Brown University, but CBP officials say when she flew into Boston’s Logan International Airport on Thursday, she had images of Hezbollah figures on her phone.\n\nShe was put on a plane out of the U.S. on Friday, about the same time a judge ordered her to be kept in the country pending a decision.\n\nCBP said the order didn’t reach its staff at the airport until the plane had departed.\n\nIn court documents Monday, CBP justified the decision to block the doctor.\n\n“With the discovery of these photographs and videos CBP questioned Dr. Alawieh and determined that her true intentions in the United States could not be determined,” the documents allege, according to The Providence Journal.\n\nThe judge had scheduled an emergency hearing for Monday morning but canceled it after CBP’s new information and amid a change in attorneys for the doctor’s cousin, who filed a lawsuit to try to block her deportation.",

        "full_text": "Democrats have spent months debating how and why they lost the 2024 election. But the full picture of what happened on Election Day is only now coming into view.\n\nThe most authoritative election analyses draw on a variety of different data sources, including large sample polling, precinct-level returns, and voter file data that shows definitively who did and did not vote. And those last figures became available only recently.\n\nThe Democratic firm Blue Rose Research recently synthesized such data into a unified account of Kamala Harris’s defeat. (Blue Rose Research did ad testing for Future Forward, the largest PAC supporting Harris, which had disputes on strategy with the campaign itself.) Its analysis will command a lot of attention. Few pollsters boast a larger data set than Blue Rose — the company conducted 26 million voter interviews in 2024. And the firm’s leader, David Shor, might be the most influential data scientist in the Democratic Party.\n\nI spoke with Shor about his autopsy of the Harris campaign. We discussed the problems with the popular theory that Democrats lost because of low turnout; why zoomers are more right-wing than millennials; how TikTok makes voters more Republican; where Donald Trump’s administration is most vulnerable; what Democrats can do to win back working-class voters; and whether artificial intelligence is poised to turbo-charge America’s culture wars, among other things. Our conversation has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nBefore we get into why Democrats lost the 2024 election, let’s talk about how they lost it: Which voting blocs shifted the furthest right over the past four years?\n\nThe most important thing is that we saw incredible polarization on political engagement itself. There’s a bunch of different ways to measure this: There’s how many elections you vote in, or how important politics is to your identity. There’s how closely you follow the news. But across all of these, there’s a consistent story: The most engaged people swung toward Democrats between 2020 and 2024, despite the fact that Democrats did worse overall.\n\nMeanwhile, people who are the least politically engaged swung enormously against Democrats. They’re a group that Biden either narrowly won or narrowly lost four years ago. But this time, they voted for Trump by double digits.\n\nAnd I think this is just analytically important. People have a lot of complaints about how the mainstream media covered things. But I think it’s important to note that the people who watch the news the most actually became more Democratic. And the problem was basically this large group of people who really don’t follow the news at all becoming more conservative.\n\nIf they’re not responding to mainstream media information, where are they getting their views on politics? Is this group reacting to the prices at the grocery store, or firsthand experience of changes in the economy, immigration, or culture?\n\nMost people have to balance their reaction to objective facts in the economy with their preexisting ideological beliefs. A strongly Democratic voter isn’t going to switch to Trump just because they’re upset about high prices. So, it isn’t too surprising that the people with the weakest political loyalties would be the most responsive to changes in economic conditions.\n\nThis story was first featured in The Rebuild.\n\nSign up here for more stories on the lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat — and a closer look at where they should go next. From senior correspondent Eric Levitz.\n\nAnd people who are politically disengaged — like every other subgroup of people this election — overwhelmingly listed the cost of living as the thing they were the most concerned about.\n\nBut it can’t just be inflation. Politically disengaged voters went from being a roughly neutral group in 2020 to favoring the Republicans by about 15 points in 2024. But during the Obama era, this was a solidly Democratic group, favoring us by between 10 and 15 points. So there’s also this long-term trend that goes beyond inflation or social media. Our coalition has been transitioning from working-class people to college-educated people.\n\nTo move beyond the why, this shift in the partisanship of politically disengaged voters has a really important implication: For most of the last 15 years, we’ve really lived in this world where the mantra was “If everybody votes, we win.” But we’re now at a point where the more people vote, the better Republicans do.\n\nIf I understand you correctly, you’re suggesting that Democrats cannot rebuild a national majority merely by juicing higher turnout, since registered voters as a whole were more pro-Trump in 2024 than those who actually showed up at the polls.\n\nNevertheless, many progressives have attributed Harris’s loss to depressed turnout among Democratic voters specifically. They point to the fact that, between 2020 and 2024, the Democratic presidential nominee’s vote total fell by significantly more than Trump’s tally increased. And they also note that, according to AP VoteCast, only 4 percent of Biden 2020 voters backed Trump last year — while a roughly equal percentage of Trump 2020 voters switched to Kamala. So, in their telling, if defections roughly canceled out while a large number of voters went from supporting Biden to staying home, then clearly the problem was inadequate Democratic turnout. So if Harris had focused more on energizing the progressive base, she might have won. What do you think is wrong with that narrative?\n\nWell, the problem with the AP VoteCast data is that it was released the day after the election. There was just a lot of information that they didn’t have at the time. At this point, voter file data has been released for enough states to account for an overwhelming majority of the 2024 vote. And what’s really cool about having that data is that you can really decompose what fraction of the change in vote share was people changing their mind versus changes in who voted.\n\nAnd when you do that, you see that roughly 30 percent of the change in Democratic vote share from 2020 to 2024 was changes in who voted — changes in turnout. But the other 70 percent was people changing their mind. And that’s in line with the breakdown we’ve seen for most elections in the past 30 years.\n\nThe reality is that these things always tend to move in the same direction — parties that lose ground with swing voters tend to simultaneously see worse turnout. And for a simple reason. There were a lot of Democratic voters who were angry at their party last year. And they were mostly moderate and conservative Democrats angry about the cost of living and other issues. And even though they couldn’t bring themselves to vote for a Republican, a lot of them stayed home. But basically, their complaints were very similar to those of Biden voters who flipped to Trump.\n\nThe reality is if all registered voters had turned out, then Donald Trump would’ve won the popular vote by 5 points [instead of 1.7 points]. So, I think that a “we need to turn up the temperature and mobilize everyone” strategy would’ve made things worse.\n\nAccording to your data, voters who got their news from TikTok were much more likely to swing to the GOP than other voters, even after controlling for demographics. Why do you think that is?\n\nI think people can debate how much of this is the nature of the algorithm versus the strategic choices that the parties made. A lot of people argue that maybe TikTok just helps negative content get promoted, and that’s naturally bad for whoever’s the incumbent. But TikTok is also really different from social media that came before.\n\nOther social media sites are very dependent on what people call “the follower graph.” If you look on Instagram Reels, for example, the correlation between how many views a video gets and how many followers the creator has is extremely high. On TikTok, it’s quite a bit lower than any other platform. And the reason is TikTok uses machine learning to analyze a video — and make a good guess about whether it will be appealing — before they show it to anyone. So if your video is likely to be engaging, it can get wide distribution even if you don’t have a following. And that has been genuinely democratizing.\n\nWe used to live in this world where in order to get your message out there, you had to get people who write really well to absorb your message and put it out. And now, we’re in a world where anyone can make a video and if that video is appealing, it’ll get out there. And this is naturally bad for the left, simply because the people who write really well are a lot more left-wing than the overall population.\n\nOne of my favorite stats on this is something that Nate Cohn put out a couple years ago: Working-class white voters who’ve read a book in the last year are much more Democratic than working-class white voters who haven’t.\n\nSo what other groups did Democrats lose ground with, beyond those who pay little attention to politics and TikTok enthusiasts?\n\nIf you look at predominantly immigrant neighborhoods, whether they’re white or Hispanic or Asian or African, you really see these absolutely massive shifts against Democrats. Trump won Corona in Queens. Immigrants go from a D+27 group in 2020 to a potentially R+1 group in 2024.\n\nI’m not sure why that happened. I think we’re still waiting for data to come back. But I’d guess it’s the same stories about the cost of living and cultural issues and ideological polarization.\n\nSpeaking of ideological polarization: One of the findings in your data is that nonwhite voters who identify as “conservative” or “moderate” have been voting more and more like their white ideological counterparts over the past few elections. So, the electorate is polarizing less on race and more on ideology.\n\nI feel like there’s an argument that this was inevitable: Hispanic and Asian Americans were always likely to follow the political trajectory of other immigrant groups, many of which were tethered to the Democratic Party for the first couple of generations but then started to polarize ideologically as they became more affluent and assimilated. And you could perhaps tell a similar story about Black Americans, in which the easing of extreme racial oppression and segregation makes it easier for conservative African Americans to consider voting for the GOP.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe Democrats just made some avoidable mistakes that alienated these constituencies. So I’m wondering how you understand this development?\n\nIf we look at 2016 to 2024 trends by race and ideology, you see this clear story where white voters really did not shift at all. Kamala Harris did exactly as well as Hillary Clinton did among white conservatives, white liberals, white moderates.\n\nBut if you look among Hispanic and Asian voters, you see these enormous double-digit declines. To highlight one example: In 2016, Democrats got 81 percent of Hispanic moderates. Fast-forward to 2024; Democrats got only 57 percent of Hispanic moderates, which is really very similar to the 51 percent that Harris got among white moderates.\n\nYou know, white people only really started to polarize heavily on ideology in the 1990s. Now, nonwhite voters are starting to polarize on ideology the same way that white voters did.\n\nIf you look at African Americans, they did not swing nearly as much. But in our polling, before the Kamala switchover, Black voters were poised to swing 7 to 8 percentage points against us.\n\nAs to whether this is inevitable, I would say that to some degree getting 94 percent of any ethnic group is unsustainable. But I think the losses that we’re seeing among nonwhite voters and immigrants is symptomatic of this broader, ideological polarization that Democrats are suffering from.\n\nFundamentally, 40 percent of the country identifies as conservative. Roughly 40 percent is moderate, 20 percent is liberal, though it depends exactly how you ask it. Sometimes it’s 25 percent liberal. But the reality is that, to the extent that Democrats try to polarize the electorate on self-described ideology, this is just something that plays into the hands of Republicans.\n\nThis isn’t necessarily as ideologically restrictive as people think. If you look at moderates — and especially nonwhite moderates — a bunch of them hold very progressive views on a variety of economic and social issues. A very large fraction of Trump voters identify as pro-choice. We’ve seen populist economic messaging do very well in our testing with voters of all kinds. But I think that there are also some big cultural divides between highly educated people who live in cities and everybody else. And to the extent that we make the cultural signifiers of these highly educated people the face and the brand of our party, that is going to make everyone else turn against us.\n\nOne surprising thing\n\nYoung people have been one of the most reliably Democratic constituencies for more than a decade. According to the Democratic data firm Catalist, Joe Biden won voters under 30 by 23 points in 2020. But Blue Rose Research’s data suggests that Trump narrowly won that demographic in 2024.\n\nHow do young voters fit into this? In my understanding, young voters shifted significantly against Democrats in 2024.\n\nYeah. So this is related to the other trends: Young people are more nonwhite than the overall electorate. They’re more politically disengaged than the overall electorate. But the single biggest predictor of swing from 2020 to 2024 is age. Voters under 30 supported Biden by large margins. But Donald Trump probably narrowly won 18- to 29-year-olds. That isn’t what the exit polls say. But if you look at our survey data, voter file data, and precinct-level data, that’s the picture you get.\n\nAnd if you look at people under the age of 25, every single group — white, nonwhite, male or female — is considerably more conservative than their millennial counterparts. And it even seems that Donald Trump narrowly won nonwhite 18-year-old men, which is not something that has ever happened in Democratic politics before.\n\nSo, young people are quite a bit more right-wing than they were four years ago. And a lot of that is replacement. It’s a different set of young people. It turns out, people age.\n\nWhat’s your sense of why this generation of young people is more conservative than we were? Is it about each cohort’s distinctive formative experiences? In my understanding, political events that transpire during your adolescence and early adulthood can shape your worldview in a durable way. So, maybe the millennial generation came of age during the disaster that was George W. Bush’s second term, and then associated Democrats with an incredibly charismatic two-term president in Barack Obama — while young zoomers associated Democrats with Covid and inflation under Biden? Or is something else at play?\n\nYeah, I think some of that story is true. Yair Ghitza has an incredible paper that shows that people have formative political years. And you can predict a lot of how conservative someone will be from how popular the incumbent president was when they were teenagers or when they were in their 20s. And so I think that’s definitely true and it’s definitely part of the story. But I think that there’s more to the story than that.\n\nIf you look at the millennials, the millennials were more left-wing in a bunch of countries — Canada, the UK, and Europe. I think that there’s a story you can tell: Baby boomers were an incredibly left-wing generation in most places in the world. And millennials were their kids.\n\nBut Gen X was really quite a bit more conservative than the Boomers in most countries. And there’s a lot of theories you can make about that — response to the oil shocks, stagflation, neoliberalism. But whatever the reason, Gen X came out more conservative. So I think that part of the story is simply that the current crop of young people had Gen X parents. And in our surveys, if we ask people, “How Democratic were your parents growing up?” zoomers are something like 7 percent more likely to say they had Republican parents than millennials are.\n\nBut isn’t part of the Democrats’ problem with younger voters about men, specifically?\n\nYeah. There’s also this enormous amount of gender polarization. If you look at the gender gap — just what fraction of the vote Kamala Harris got versus what fraction of the vote Donald Trump got among men and women — for voters over the age of 30, there was about a 10 percent gender gap between men and women. And that’s, roughly speaking, where it’s been in American politics for most of the last 20 years.\n\nBut if you look at voters under the age of 25, the gender gap has doubled in size. And if you look at 18-year-olds specifically, 18-year-old men were 23 percentage points more likely to vote for Donald Trump than 18-year-old women. And gender polarization seems to be increasing in other countries as well. How it plays out varies from country to country. In Germany, for example, young women voted in very high numbers for Die Linke, the left-wing party there.\n\nA lot of different things could be causing this. But I think that if you look at non-political polling, you can really see evidence that there is wild, cultural change afoot here and basically everywhere else in the online world. In Norway, there’s a poll of high school students where the fraction of young men saying, “gender equality has gone too far” spiked in recent years.\n\nI don’t know necessarily what the answer to that is. But I think it’s important to resist nihilism. These young men who have terrible, retrograde views on politics and gender relations are still pro-choice. They still support universal health care. I think we need our politicians to focus on those fights. But it’s extremely important for other people — who don’t need to win elections — to try to improve the online discourse around these more divisive issues.\n\nEarlier, you referenced the divide between cosmopolitan, college graduates who live in big cities and working-class voters. And you suggested that Democrats need to distance themselves from the sensibilities of highly educated urbanites. I’m wondering if you could get more concrete. Do you think the party merely needs to increase the salience of its best issues by focusing on them rhetorically? Or are there areas where you believe Democrats need to become substantively more conservative?\n\nI think there are two very important things to understand about this election. The first thing is that the Biden administration was extremely unpopular. His approval ratings collapsed after Afghanistan and then continued to decline as prices went up and immigration happened. The budget fights in the fall of 2021 around the reconciliation package were particularly damaging. And then, his approval ratings never really recovered. And so, I think there’s a substantive angle to that.\n\nThe way that we like to track issues is that we look at 40 different issues and we ask people basically, “How important are these issues?” And then, “What party do you trust more on these issues?”\n\nIn 2020, what people cared about the most was Covid and health care. And those were also the issues that people trusted us on the most. And so the thing we had to do was very straightforward: We just had to talk about Covid and health care. That’s what we did. And we won.\n\nBut the situation this time was a lot harder. The issue that voters cared the most about was overwhelmingly the cost of living. I really cannot stress how much people cared about the cost of living. If you ask what’s more important, the cost of living or some other issue picked at random, people picked the cost of living 91 percent of the time. It’s really hard to get 91 percent of people to click on anything in a survey.\n\nAfter the cost of living, it was the size and scope of the federal government, the budget deficit, immigration, crime, and also health care. And people trusted Republicans on these issues by double-digits — except for health care, where we had a 2-point advantage, which was much lower than our traditional advantage on that issue.\n\nI think there’s this nihilism that’s very popular in our industry — that nothing we do, or that the other side does, really matters. But in the wake of inflation, voters went from favoring Republicans by about 5 points on the economy to favoring them by 15 or 16. And after Dobbs, voters started trusting the Democrats much more on abortion. Education used to be the Democrats’ strongest issue. But our standing on that collapsed during Covid, and now it’s basically even. So, what people care about and trust us on really is responsive to concrete events that happen in the world. That isn’t 100 percent of the story. There are a lot of other things going on. But what we do and what we say does matter.\n\nTo directly answer your original question — about how much of this is changing what our positions are versus messaging — I think the exact details of that vary from issue to issue. But I think that we have to approach this from the position that we are in a deep trust hole. The people that we’re trying to persuade have very different values than we do and have a very different perception of reality. And a lot of these people are very poorly informed and literally do not consume the sources of information that we broadcast to.\n\nAnd so, there has to be some combination of messaging and outreach and changes in how we approach these platforms, and also probably some substantive changes that address what voters see as an error.\n\nIt seems to me that the Democratic Party’s biggest challenge is less how to win the presidency than how to win comfortable Senate majorities. The median US state is much more conservative than America as a whole, and this means that the Senate is heavily biased against Democrats. In 2018 and 2020, Democrats won really strong national victories — and still ended up with just 50 Senate votes in 2021. So, how grim do you think the party’s prospects of winning back the Senate are in the near term, and how can it go about improving those odds?\n\nI think we should start by recognizing how lucky we are. In 2020, we won basically every competitive Senate race. And in both 2022 and 2024, we saw something that I had never seen before, which is that we did a lot better in swing Senate races than we did nationally.\n\nBut a lot of that was the other side running terrible candidates. And we can’t count on that happening forever. And even despite that — even despite historically well-run campaigns and historically weak opposition — here we are four years later at 47 Senate seats and with a very difficult path to getting back to 50 even in a wave Democratic year.\n\nAnd I think that something has to change in order for us to have a majority that’s capable of securing the Senate. But I don’t want to overemphasize the ideological dimension of that. What we really need to do to win in places like Ohio and Iowa is change the brand.\n\nThe candidate who outperformed the most in 2024 at the top of the ticket was Dan Osborn in Nebraska. And some of that was just because he ran as an independent. But a lot of it was that he ran an economically populist campaign that focused on issues that people cared about. I think that the moderate and left-wings of the party don’t like each other very much, but they did both like Dan Osborn.\n\nTo push back a little on that, Osborn definitely ran a populist campaign. But he also aired advertisements declaring himself “the only real conservative” in the race, attacked his Republican opponent for voting to fund the government, said that he would personally help build Trump’s border wall, and didn’t endorse Kamala Harris.\n\nAnd so, I feel like there definitely was an element of ideological moderation — or at least, heterodoxy — to his approach. More critically, Osborn refused to say which party he would caucus with once he got to the Senate. And yet, assuming he secretly did intend to caucus with the Democrats, that’s a play you can only run a single time. After that first run, voters know which party you really favor. And it doesn’t seem tenable for Democratic Senate candidates writ large to all pretend that they support Trump or might actually caucus with Republicans. So it’s not clear to me how the Osborn model scales.\n\nI think the main problem is that we tried this strategy in an incredibly red state. I think Trump won Nebraska statewide by 20.5 points. But there are a bunch of states he won by between 4 and 7 points. The degree of ideological compromise that is necessary to win in a state like Ohio is very different than the degree of ideological compromise that’s necessary to win in a state like Nebraska. And the current status quo is that we have a very low chance of winning in these places at all using the current strategy. But that said, I think that both wings of the party have to make sacrifices in order for us to achieve the coalition that we want.\n\nThere’s an interesting tension in your polling: Voters generally say that they would like the Democratic Party to be more moderate, while also saying they favor “major change” and a “shock to the system” because things in America are going poorly. I think many people would look at that and see a contradiction. After all, moderate Democrats generally have less enthusiasm for major policy change — and feel more comfortable with the status quo — than progressive Democrats do.\n\nIt’s tricky. On the one hand, voters say they thought that the Democratic candidate was too liberal. But on the other hand, in our randomized control trials, the best testing advertisements were more compatible with progressive critiques of the Harris campaign. The single best testing ad by the Kamala Harris campaign was one where she looked directly into the camera and said something like, “I know the cost of living is too high, and I’m going to fix that by building more housing and taking on landlords who are charging too much.”\n\nAnd I think you can get into existential debates about what economic populism really is. But I think that the existing research really pointed clearly toward the idea that the electorate wanted economic change — and cared more about that than preserving America’s institutions.\n\nWhatever you want to say about Trump, he has delivered a “shock to the system” — though maybe not the one that voters were hoping for. In your polling, has there been a reduction in support for the president since he took office? If so, where do you see him as being most vulnerable?\n\nYeah. Trump’s approval rating has dropped since he took office. His ratings on his handling of the economy, which historically was a strong suit for him, have dropped the most, and his handling of cost of living has also gone down by quite a bit. And Elon Musk has become much more unpopular and is now the most unpopular member of his administration by a good deal. Trump and Elon have really spent the first part of their term diving into the biggest weaknesses of the Republican Party — namely, they’re trying to pass tax cuts for billionaires, they’re cutting essential services and causing chaos for regular people left and right, while trying to slash social safety net programs. It’s Paul Ryan-ism on steroids.\n\nI think we have a real opportunity to return to the politics of 2012, in terms of vigorously opposing these very unpopular economic changes that Trump is pushing through.\n\nThe presentation that you’ve been giving to Democratic stakeholders takes a sharp turn at the very end. You warn that the party cannot get stuck fighting the last war, and argue that 1) AI is going to cause mass unemployment in the relatively near future, 2) this social and political shock is likely to exacerbate partisan tensions in the US, and 3) Democrats need to start preparing for this scenario. Can you explain your reasoning?\n\nI’m not an AI expert by any means, but AI capabilities are increasing dramatically. And AI experts are very, very bullish on the extent to which AI systems are going to be able to replace some fraction of jobs. The prediction markets say this, too. And I think something that’s really important is that regardless of whether it’s going to happen or not, the public believes it will happen.\n\nIf you just ask, “Do you believe that AI will be able to perform most people’s jobs better than humans can in the next 10 years?” 65 percent of the population says yes and 35 percent says no.\n\nAnd then, when you ask, “Do you think this will be good or bad?” Something like 80 percent of the population believes that this is going to be bad. And so, I think this is something where voters are ahead of the political classes of both parties right now.\n\nI think when you try to speculate about something like this, it’s important to recognize that nothing like this has ever really happened before, so it’s hard to make predictions. But we worked with two economists, Jonathan Hersh and Daniel Rock, who have made fine-grained estimates of which jobs are going to be the most affected by AI and which the least. And their work indicates that this will impact college-educated people more than working-class people for the simple reason that LLMs are advancing more quickly than robotics is. And AI will also have a bigger impact on employment in cities and suburbs than in rural areas. And it will impact women more than men.\n\nAnd I really worry that this may accelerate these cultural divides that politics have been centered on in the last decade, in a way that could be unproductive and dark. In a lot of ways, this could be the biggest culture war fight of the century. And I don’t pretend that I have the answer on what we should do. But with Covid, we had this sudden shock and our response just reinforced the dysfunctional cultural divides that had already opened up in 2016. And those effects have persisted and made it harder for us to win elections today. But unlike with Covid, we have a real chance of seeing this next shock a year or two ahead of time. And we really have to think about this proactively and not just dig our heads into the sand.\n\nCorrection, March 18, 12pm: Trump won Nebraska statewide by about 20.5 points.

        "full_text": "Annegret Hilse | Reuters\n\nGermany's Bundestag on Tuesday voted in favor of a major fiscal package, which includes changes to long-standing debt policies to enable higher defense spending and a 500 billion euro ($548 billion) infrastructure and climate fund.\n\nSome 513 parliamentary members voted in favor of the plan, while 207 voted against it. There were no abstentions.\n\nMore than two thirds of parliament were needed to support the package in order for it to pass. The law also needs to be approved by the Bundesrat, a body representing the country's states, on Friday to become enshrined in Germany's constitution.\n\nUnder the proposed new laws, defense and certain security expenditures above a certain threshold would no longer be subject to the debt brake, which limits how much debt the government can take on and dictates the size of the federal government's structural budget deficit.\n\nLoans taken on as part of the infrastructure fund would also be exempt from the debt brake, while Germany's states would also have greater flexibility around debt.\n\nCarsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, on Tuesday said the vote meant the debt brake rule is now \"not officially dead but buried alive.\"\n\n\"Germany has given up on leading the group of fiscal frugals in Europe for the sake of boosting its economy,\" he added.\n\nThe Christian Democratic Union, alongside its sister party the Christian Social Union, which jointly won the largest share of votes in Germany's national election in February, proposed the fiscal shift in collaboration with the Social Democratic Party. The factions appear likely to form the incoming coalition government, with the fiscal reform package a by-product of talks about a potential governing partnership between them.\n\nA tight vote\n\nTime pressure to pass the reforms is high as they require changes to the constitution and need the support of two thirds of both parliament and the Bundesrat.\n\nThis was likely only going to be possible before the newly elected parliament comes together for the first time next week, as parties opposing the fiscal package will then have a larger share of the vote and could potentially block the plans.\n\nSeveral of the parties that oppose the reforms have also unsuccessfully launched legal challenges to hinder the vote.\n\nLiesa Johannssen | Reuters\n\nIn the lead-up to the Tuesday vote, the CDU-CSU and SPD also had to negotiate for the backing of Germany's Green Party, ultimately agreeing on a compromise that includes 100 billion euros of the infrastructure fund being allocated to climate and economic transformation efforts and a broadening of the security-related issues exempted from the debt brake.\n\nA boost to the economy?\n\nAnalysts and economists have broadly reacted positively to the reform plans, viewing them as a potentially major boost for Germany's struggling economy.\n\nRobin Winkler, chief German economist at Deutsche Bank Research, urged caution, however, suggesting there was still work to be done for the incoming government.\n\n\"This is a historic fiscal regime shift, arguably the largest since German reunification,\" he said Tuesday after the vote. \"Yet, as with reunification, a fiscal expansion does not guarantee success: the next government will need to deliver structural reforms to turn this fiscal package into sustainable growth.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nThe German economy narrowly skirted a technical recession — or two consecutive quarters of economic contraction — throughout 2023 and 2024, but has been effectively stagnant.\n\nThe OECD on Monday said it was now projecting Germany's gross domestic product to grow by an annual 0.4% this year, down from the previously forecast 0.7% expansion. German economic institute Ifo, meanwhile, said it was cutting its outlook for the country's economy to 0.2% growth year-on-year.\n\nIt comes as Germany is facing sustained infrastructure problems, as well as issues in key industries such as housebuilding and autos. The country is also battling the threat of potential tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump on imports to the U.S. from Europe — which could be especially difficult for Germany due to its high levels of trade with the U.S.",

        "full_text": "Gaetz ended up withdrawing from consideration, but it doesn’t stop disagreements over how to proceed within the notoriously private committee from spilling out into the open, with finger pointing over the source of leaks potentially coming from inside the panel’s ranks. Democrats accused some Republicans of trying to shield Gaetz from scrutiny over allegations of illicit drug use and paying a minor for sex.\n\nThe Ethics Committee is never a coveted assignment, which means party leaders will inevitably have a difficult time finding members to reconstitute the panel, said one GOP lawmaker granted anonymity to speak candidly.\n\n“Nobody ever wants to sit on the committee,” the lawmaker said in an interview.\n\nBut the Gaetz episode has contributed to conditions from which the Ethics Committee could struggle to fully recover, former members said in interviews. It could plunge the panel into further dysfunction as the committee prepares in the coming weeks to ramp up after a monthslong delay and a pileup of potential cases.\n\n“It is a monster cloud,” former Rep. Mike Conaway, who served as Ethics Committee chair from 2013-2015, said of the allegations of leaks in the previous Congress that could plague the panel’s current membership.\n\nHouse Republican leaders tapped GOP Rep. Michael Guest of Missouri to return as committee chair, joining repeat Reps. John Rutherford (R-Fla.), Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.), Veronica Escobar (D-Texas), Deborah Ross (D-N.C.) and Glenn Ivey (D-Md.).\n\nNew Republican members assigned to the Ethics Committee will be Reps. Nathaniel Moran of Texas and Ashley Hinson of Iowa. Democratic leadership tapped Rep. Sylvia Garcia of Texas to join the committee, and selected Rep. Mark DeSaulnier of California as the new ranking member.\n\nAmong their first items of business might be resuming an investigation held over from the previous Congress into Rep. Cory Mills, a Florida Republican who drew attention last month over allegations of assault by the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nParamount to the committee’s integrity on all matters is its strict code of confidentiality: Members agree never to speak in any capacity about its pending business, on or off the record. After the events surrounding Gaetz, however, it’s not clear that confidentiality is still guaranteed.\n\nA flurry of news reports late last year revealed how members of the Ethics Committee were fighting over how to handle the Gaetz situation — insider information that spilled out into the public domain. Finger-pointing abounded as to who was leaking the private details, including the fact that there was a split secret vote on whether to release the Gaetz report.\n\nThese events also obliterated the longstanding presumption of nonpartisanship inside the committee, which is the only panel evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. Guest called the report’s release a “dangerous departure with potentially catastrophic consequences.” Speaker Mike Johnson had said he did not want the report to be public.\n\nIn a further divide, as the Ethics Committee deliberated on next steps, Democrats were making procedural moves to force a vote on the House floor to release the report on Gaetz. Rep. Sean Casten, an Illinois Democrat leading that effort, recently called the Ethics Committee “a speed bump on the road to hell [Johnson] is driving himself on.”\n\n“Everything’s become so partisan, and if [the committee] hasn’t become actually partisan, there’s suspicions of partisanship regardless of what people do or say,” said former Rep. John Yarmuth, a Kentucky Democrat who served on the Ethics Committee from 2011-2013, in an interview. “It undermines any decision the committee makes.”\n\nYarmuth added, “If you attack the credibility of the Ethics Committee, then nobody fears the Ethics Committee … I think you’d want to be afraid of running afoul of the Ethics Committee.”\n\nFormer Rep. Gregg Harper, a Mississippi Republican who served on the panel alongside Yarmuth, in the private sector now represents lawmakers who have cases pending before the House Ethics Committee and the Office of Congressional Ethics, a nonpartisan entity tasked with vetting outside complaints against lawmakers before sending them to the formal committee.\n\nHe said the decision to release the report on Gaetz after he had already left Congress undermined one of the key motivators of the Ethics Committee: Pushing bad acting lawmakers out of office. After all, Gaetz’s decision to resign from the House following his nomination to be attorney general by then-President-elect Donald Trump was widely seen as an effort to avoid the release of a damning report into his alleged misconduct that could foil his chances for confirmation.\n\n“It’s always been understood, ‘hey, if you’re in a mess, you leave — get out of there, don’t come back,’” Harper said in an interview. “The reality is sometimes a member needs to leave … one motivation to leave is, ‘Okay, I can put this behind me, and there won’t be anything else that I’ll to deal with, maybe, in the press.’”\n\nHarper and Yarmuth both recalled the discomfort they experienced when leadership drafted them into serving on the Ethics Committee. Harper said his colleagues asked if then-Speaker John Boehner was “mad at you about something?” Yarmuth said he was approached on the House floor by Rep. Maxine Waters, during the committee’s investigation into her dealings with a bank in which her husband had a financial interest.\n\n“How can you do this?” Yarmuth said Waters would repeatedly plead with him on the floor.\n\nIn a sign that leaders of the reconstituted Ethics Committee are for the time being adhering to the rules, a spokesperson for DeSauliner referred comment for this story to the panel’s staff director — whose job it is to interface with the media — citing confidentiality policies. The staff director, in turn, declined to comment. A spokesperson for Guest also referred press inquiries to the staff director.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who was the chair of the Ethics Committee from 2009-2011 — during which time she oversaw the investigation that culminated in a rare censure of a fellow member of her own party, the late-Rep. Charlie Rangel of New York, for tax violations — said she wasn’t sure where the panel would go from here.\n\n“It’s very difficult,” she conceded, when asked about the future of the panel in the wake of the Gaetz report. “But they operate with discretion, so we really don’t know the details.”",

        "full_text": "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) is facing the toughest fight of his Senate leadership career amid sharp attacks from his party’s base over his vote to advance a House Republican-drafted funding bill.\n\nSenate Democratic colleagues say Schumer, who is 74 years old, isn’t going anywhere as party leader, but they’re questioning his decisionmaking in a way they haven’t during his previous eight years as leader.\n\nMultiple senators complained about the lack of a clear strategy from their leadership heading into last week’s standoff with Senate and House Republicans over the House-passed funding bill, according to sources familiar with the sometimes heated discussions within the Senate Democratic Caucus.\n\nThe legislation cut $15 billion from nondefense programs and didn’t include guardrails to slow Elon Musk’s assault on the federal bureaucracy.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (Conn.), a rising Democratic star who has led the faction of Democratic senators calling for tougher tactics to resist President Trump, says he still supports Schumer as leader but warned that the party needs to show more urgency.\n\nAsked Sunday by “Meet the Press” host Kristen Welker if Schumer is the “best person” to lead Senate Democrats, Murphy said “he can lead the caucus” but cautioned “we need to have a conversation inside the caucus about whether we are willing to stand up to Republicans.”\n\nMurphy told The Hill that Senate Democrats risk becoming “irrelevant if we don’t use our power on cloture to demand that we have a seat at the table” on upcoming fights this summer and fall over raising the debt ceiling and funding the government.\n\n“We obviously have to make sure that we aren’t cut out of negotiations in the future,” he said.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said Democrats have “a lot of soul-searching” to do regarding strategy and tactics.\n\nSchumer has faced criticism — albeit indirectly — from a prominent member of his leadership team, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who declared after the disappointing 2024 election that Democrats were no longer the party of the working class.\n\nSanders accused Democrats in November of abandoning the working class, and he accused party leaders of defending the “status quo.” He also led opposition to the House-passed funding bill, saying it would “literally take food out of the mouths of hungry children, take health care away from seniors, and give a huge tax break to the wealthiest people on the planet.”\n\nMany Democrats were outraged by Schumer’s vote to advance the Republican spending bill; Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), a leading progressive, called it a betrayal.\n\nSaying it was a “huge slap in the face,” she noted that vulnerable Democrats in districts Trump won in 2024 risked their seats to vote against the bill, only to watch 10 Democratic senators “acquiesce” to the Republican legislation.\n\nThe backlash was so intense that Schumer postponed a publicity tour scheduled for this week to promote his new book, “Antisemitism in America: A Warning,” due to what his publicity team called “security concerns.”\n\nEven aside from last week’s battle, key Democrats are growing disenchanted with the party’s ability to connect with voters — especially white voters without college degrees.\n\nFormer Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who lost his seat in last year’s election despite Senate Democrats and their allies pouring tens of millions of dollars into his race, warned earlier this month that the Democratic Party’s reputation had become “toxic.”\n\n“We must reckon with how far our party has strayed from our New Deal roots. How we see ourselves — the party of the people, the party of the working class and the middle class — no longer matches up with what most voters think,” he wrote on the social platform X.\n\nSchumer responded to these criticisms in a New York Times interview.\n\nHe acknowledged the Democratic Party had “lost” its reputation with many voters as the party of the working class but insisted it wasn’t because its values had changed but because its messaging had failed to connect with too many Americans.\n\n“We always cared about the working people. But in the last few years, while we did a lot for working people, here’s what we didn’t do: We didn’t tell people about it. We thought, just by legislating, people would know about it. They don’t!” he said.\n\nBack in Washington, some Democratic lawmakers are privately grumbling over what many in their base view as the Democratic leadership’s feeble response to Trump’s agenda.\n\nSchumer’s press conferences vowing to resist Trump’s agenda earlier this year have been mocked by Democratic commentators on television and on social media.\n\nComedian Jon Stewart last month pleaded with Democrats to “stop f‑‑‑ing trotting Schumer out there every time Trump traverses into the unreal,” taking a shot at a Schumer news conference in which he used an avocado and Corona beer as props to illustrate his points about the economic impact of Trump’s tariffs.\n\nInside the Capitol, some Democrats are calling for Schumer to come up with a better game plan to counter partisan must-pass bills coming from the House.\n\nCritics within the party said that Schumer’s strategy last week appeared to be simply hoping that the partisan funding bill wouldn’t make it out of the House.\n\nBut some Democratic senators, notably Sen. John Fetterman (Pa.), thought it was likely that Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) would muster enough votes to pass the bill.\n\nSen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), the ranking member of the Budget Committee, took the lead in urging colleagues to vote against the House funding bill after it passed the lower chamber Tuesday.\n\nThey did so even after Schumer made clear to his Democratic colleagues in private conversations that he wanted to avoid a government shutdown at all costs.\n\nSchumer later argued on the floor that even though he thought the House-passed bill was “terrible,” it was still a better option than allowing the government to shut down.\n\n“Allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option,” he warned.\n\nSome Democratic senators who split with Schumer over his decision to help Republicans pass a partisan funding bill acknowledge he may have made the right call. They concede that it could have played into Trump’s and Musk’s plan to slash federal programs had the government shut down Saturday.\n\nAnd some Democratic senators are relieved Schumer and his close allies, including Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (Ill.) and Sen. Brian Schatz (Hawaii), took the tough votes to advance the spending bill so they didn’t have to.\n\nBut there’s growing frustration among Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill that they’re out of step with much of America.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have said for months that the results of the 2024 election, in which they lost control of the White House and Senate, shows their party is failing to connect with voters in a fundamental way.\n\nAfter last week’s bruising battle, some Democratic senators say it’s time to start thinking about who will succeed Schumer.\n\nBut even while Democratic senators start to mull a new generation of leadership, they emphasize Schumer is likely to stay in his job through 2028, when he will be up for reelection at the age of 78.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), the chair of the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, and Schatz, who is deputy Democratic conference secretary, are two lawmakers poised to move up the leadership ladder — as is Murphy, who spearheaded the negotiation of a bipartisan border security package last year.\n\nBut Klobuchar, 64, who ran for president in 2020 and gained more traction than many Democratic strategists expected, and Murphy, 51, may be harboring presidential ambitions.\n\nAnd Schatz, 52, has a lower public profile than many of his Democratic colleagues, even though he is a prolific presence on social media.\n\nSome Democratic lawmakers think it’s time for a “new generation” of leadership, which means that Murray, who is 74, and Durbin, who is 80 and considered likely to retire in 2026, are not first-choice candidates to replace Schumer.\n\nSen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), 66, who brokered a deal Friday with Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) to fix a provision in the House bill that would cut close to $1 billion from the District of Columbia’s budget, has been floated as a dark horse future candidate for leader. Van Hollen has kept a low profile in the Senate, but he held leadership positions in the House.\n\nSen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), 64, who led House prosecutors during Trump’s first impeachment trial in 2021 and represents the nation’s biggest state, is also seen as a rising star who could vault to the top of the leadership ranks once he has time to establish himself in the Senate.\n\nHe was just elected to the upper chamber last year, but colleagues are already touting him as someone with huge leadership potential.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc.

        "full_text": "Our immigration system is broken; you hear it being said all the time by politicians and media types, but what they never say is how or why. Their only response to anything related to immigration is “We need comprehensive reform,” which always includes “a pathway to citizenship,” which is code for voting. We see it. But the truth of the matter is that the system isn’t broken; the people running it are.\n\nIf you had a brand new car, opened the hood, and started pulling wires or loosening bolts, it would not work very well, would it? If you have an entire immigration system in place, then, over years, start ignoring parts of it while randomly changing other parts. How well do you think it will function?\n\nThat’s what these people have done to the immigration system. They whine is “broken.” You broke it, you jerks. It doesn’t need “fixing” by creating something new or wiping the slate clean, it needs to be allowed to function. They don’t let it. They won’t let it.\n\nPutting that aside, there is one question that needs to be asked of anyone looking to enter our country, either to visit or wanting to live here with the possibility of becoming a citizen: What do we get out of it?\n\nThat’s all that matters. If you bring nothing to the table, you don’t get in. Period.\n\nThat brings us to the case of Mahmoud Khalil.\n\nWe let him into the country to attend school, and he married an American. That’s still not a free pass to be here; he only has a green card.\n\nWhat does he bring to the table, exactly?\n\nHe apparently graduated 6 months ago but had time to lead pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, and anti-American protests at the school he used to attend. Columbia is very, very expensive; how can he afford not to work? They keep repeating how he’s “got a pregnant wife at home,” shouldn’t he be working? How about simply being at home, since his wife is 8 months pregnant and he’s just a simple family man, right?\n\nThe guy has more lawyers than some towns, each more expensive than the last, but he’s just an innocent guy who never did anything to nobody or something.\n\nThere are a lot of unanswered questions about what makes this guy so special: to somehow have mobilized the left in a way they haven’t been able to muster in years. Where does his money come from? Maybe he’s rich, maybe he married rich. Perhaps he has patrons? Perhaps it’s the left-wing industrial complex that launders USAID money to anti-American activities around the globe?\n\nAll I know is my question of “What do we get out of it?” doesn’t seem to have an involved answer.\n\nIt’s not like we need another anti-Semite; we have the Democratic Party, after all. We don’t need more anti-Americans; like I said, we already have Democrats. Do we need more people with graduate degrees in “public administration”? Don’t we produce enough of those from people born here with a lifelong understanding of our government and how it works? Do we need someone from Syria to do it?\n\nWe don’t, we’re all full.\n\nWe have all the native-born BLM/ANTIFA members; we don’t need more ungrateful, privileged 30-year-olds with nothing better to do than incite people. We’re lousy and overloaded with them.\n\nThe message should be sent that people can’t come to this country and disrupt it; inspiring violence or hatred is not going to get you welcome here; it will get you invited to leave. No other country would accept it; why should we?\n\nForeigners are afforded rights when they enter this country, but they are not citizens. People on vacation, in school, or married on green cards are here at our pleasure, not theirs. Break the law, and you’re out. Be particularly annoying, and you’re out. Or should be.\n\nWhen I was 15, I took driver’s ed. Throughout the 6 weeks, or whatever it was, the instructors drilled into our heads that “driving is a privilege, not a right,” and the state could strip us of it at any point, should we screw up and get too many tickets or whatever. Why should guests in our country not be treated the same way when it comes to being in the country? It’s a privilege, not a right, no matter the conditions you are here or for how long.",

        "full_text": "Stand clear of the closing era, please.\n\nThe MTA will stop selling MetroCards sometime after 2025 — ending an iconic part of city history and lore, MTA Chair and President Janno Lieber announced in a speech Wednesday.\n\nThe transit chief didn’t give a firm date for the familiar yellow-and-blue card’s finale, but this is the first time the MTA has given any kind of time window for the three-decade-old card system to be finally phased out for its much-sturdier and contactless counterpart, OMNY.\n\n“Goodbye, MetroCard. You served us well,” Lieber said at a Crain’s New York Business event.\n\n“But it’s time to retire you to the Transit Museum, to spend many happy days with your old friend, Mr. Token.”\n\nLieber promised existing MetroCards will continue to work at turnstiles for “at least six months” after the final date.\n\nThe MetroCard’s retirement has been a long time coming — as the MTA started eyeing the contactless method back in 2017, but the project was plagued with delays.\n\nIn October, the transit authority finally began replacing subway kiosks with ones that spit out OMNY cards. The month prior, student MetroCards were replaced by OMNY cards.\n\nOMNY, which can be accessed through mobile devices or through a $5 physical plastic card, was introduced in 2021 as a more convenient alternative to the old-school MetroCards.\n\nPlus, OMNY offers free rides after 12 swipes in a single week, making the contactless method more affordable to frequent commuters.\n\n“Why are we doing all of this? The answer is simple, making it easier to pay the fare and making it more affordable means more for paying customers,” Lieber said Wednesday.\n\n“Contactless fare payment is not only faster and more convenient, it’s going to allow us to do more, much more with discounts and promotions. It’s a much more dynamic system.”\n\nMetroCards have reigned supreme in the Big Apple since its introduction in 1993. The OMNY of its time, the originally blue cards replaced subway tokens, which were only sold in packs of ten, and introduced the city to the world of free transfers.\n\nMuch like the OMNY rollout, it also took years for MetroCards to be introduced. Carol Bellamy, the first woman elected to the City Council, floated the idea back in the 1970s, but the MTA didn’t seriously contemplate it until 1983.\n\nThe Whitehall Station was the first to get the automatic fare collection (AFC) turnstiles in 1994 — and sold 600 MetroCards on its first day, New York Transit Museum Curator Jodi Shapiro told The Post.\n\nIt would be another three years before the rest of the city’s stations and all the buses in the MTA’s flee had their own AFC turnstiles, an undertaking that cost almost $700 million at the time, and was one of the biggest projects in the subway’s then-90 year history.\n\nThe MetroCard vending machines were unveiled in 1999, over 2,250 of which are in subways today — but it wouldn’t be until 2003 that token sales finally ceased.\n\n“Let’s be honest. New Yorkers hate change. When the MetroCard debuted, plenty of die-hard token users struggled with the idea. But after a few years, public perception shifted, and I think the convenience of the cards was really appreciated,” said Shapiro.\n\n“That’s the New York way — resist, complain, learn the benefits, and adapt. Not exactly the Kubler-Ross model, but close.”\n\nDespite the initial resistance, the plastic passes quickly became much more than a method of transit and was quickly usurped into the identity and iconography of New York City.\n\nT-shirts, coffee mugs, pins and even Christmas tree ornaments emboldened with the distinguishable Helvetica font can be found throughout the five boroughs — and local artists have routinely turned toward the disposable cards as a form of media to craft their pieces over the last three decades.\n\nThe cards themselves have also served as canvases through the MTA Arts & Design program, Lilly Tuttle, Curator at the Museum of the City of New York pointed out. One such piece includes the 7 million cards simply printed with the word “Optimism” in 2009 as part of a mission to inject joy into the transit hubs.\n\nWhile OMNY also signifies a leap toward the future, Tuttle acknowledged there will be a void when MetroCards become nothing more than a collector’s item.\n\n“I think there will be something lost,” said the lifelong New Yorker, who keeps several subway tokens near the desk at the museum.\n\n“There’s so much nostalgia for the token and people remember the different token styles … At the MTA store, you can buy token earrings and token lapel pins and things like that. I can imagine that in the future the nostalgia for the MetroCard will only increase because it will feel sort of retro — that whole idea of bygone technology that people increasingly have a great, great affinity for.”",

        "full_text": "When the news broke on Jan. 31 that a New York physician had been indicted for shipping abortion medications to a woman in Louisiana, Dr. Kohar Der Simonian was hit by a wave of emotions, among them fear and concern.\n\nDer Simonian works as medical director for Maine Family Planning, which is 1,500 miles from Louisiana. Like the indicted doctor, Margaret Carpenter, Der Simonian mails abortion medication to patients in states where the procedure is banned — and her own name is written on the prescriptions.\n\nDer Simonian and other staff at Maine Family Planning know Carpenter through work relationships. They all understood that the battle over abortion had escalated. At a morning staff huddle at a clinic in Augusta about a week after the indictment, it was the first thing they talked about. The mood was heavy.\n\n\"It just hit home that this is real, like this could happen to anybody, at any time now, which is scary,\" said Der Simonian. But she took a moment to remind the staff that they had been expecting a case like this.\n\n\"We didn't know how, or to who, or what charges, right? But we knew that this was going to happen,\" she said.\n\nOn Jan. 31, Carpenter became the first U.S. doctor criminally charged for providing abortion pills across state lines — a medical practice that expanded after the U.S. Supreme Court's Dobbs decision on June 24, 2022, which overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nSince then, 12 states have near-complete bans and others have enacted bans after a certain point in pregnancy.\n\nCarpenter was indicted alongside a Louisiana mother who allegedly gave the pills that Carpenter sent to her daughter, a minor.\n\nThe minor wanted to keep the pregnancy and called 911 after taking the pills, which is how the police learned of the medication and its source, according to an NPR interview with Tony Clayton, the local district attorney prosecuting the case.\n\nOn Feb. 11, Louisiana's Republican governor, Jeff Landry signed a warrant for Carpenter. He later posted a video arguing she \"must face extradition to Louisiana, where she can stand trial and justice will be served.\"\n\nNew York's Democratic governor, Kathy Hochul, countered by releasing her own video, saying she was refusing to extradite Carpenter. The charges carry a possible 5-year prison sentence.\n\n\"Louisiana has changed their laws, but that has no bearing on the laws here in the state of New York,\" Hochul said.\n\nEight states — New York, Maine, California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington — have passed laws to protect telemedicine abortion providers and block extradition in such cases. But this is the first criminal test of these shield laws.\n\nMedication abortion via telemedicine has been growing in recent years — and is now playing a critical role in keeping abortion accessible in states with bans, according to research. Doctors who prescribe pills across state lines say they face a new reality where the criminal risk is no longer hypothetical.\n\nIf they stop, tens of thousands of patients in states with abortion bans would no longer be able to end pregnancies at home under the care of a U.S. physician. But these out-of-state doctors could end up in the crosshairs of a potential legal clash over the interstate practice of medicine, especially when state laws disagree on reproductive rights.\n\nDoctors are on alert, but remain defiant\n\nDer Simonian oversees a network of clinics across Maine that offer abortions, birth control and gender-affirming care. The clinics help out-of-state patients in two ways: by mailing them mifepristone and misoprostol, and by treating patients who travel to Maine for care.\n\nOne patient recently drove over 17 hours from South Carolina, a state with a six-week abortion ban. For Der Simonian, it illustrates how desperate some of her patients are for abortion access.\n\nThe indictment against Dr. Carpenter underscored the stakes for herself — and her clinic — of continuing to do this work, Der Simonian said.\n\n\"Most people that are abortion providers also have families and other jobs. It gets complicated, putting yourself at risk,\" she said.\n\nDer Simonian has decided she is still willing to continue doing it \"because it's what's right.\"\n\nData from the #WeCount survey conducted by the Society of Family Planning shows that in states with either total abortion bans or bans after six weeks of pregnancy, an average of 7,700 people a month ordered pills to end their pregnancies from out-of-state doctors practicing under shield laws from April to June of 2024.\n\nLouisiana has seen a massive expansion of telemedicine abortions since Dobbs was overturned. Nearly 60% of abortions among Louisiana residents were via telemedicine, the highest rate of telemedicine abortions among states with strict bans, according to #WeCount.\n\nOrganizations like the Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project (MAP) are responding to the demand for care. MAP was launched after the Dobbs ruling, with the specific mission of writing prescriptions for patients in other states.\n\nLast year, MAP was mailing abortion medications to nearly 500 patients a month. Since January, they're averaging 3,000 prescriptions a month, according to the clinic's co-founder Angel Foster.\n\nNearly all of the clinic's patients — 95% — live in states with bans on abortion or on telemedicine abortions, Foster said, and 80% live in Texas or southeastern states, a region blanketed with near-total abortion restrictions.\n\nDoctors who provide abortions often know each other, and have formed a tightly-knit support network. For example, MAP's Foster knew Carpenter, the doctor indicted by Louisiana.\n\n\"I very much support her,\" Foster said, \"I feel very sad for her that she has to go through all of this.\"\n\nMAP has four doctors on staff and is hiring a fifth.\n\n\"I think there will be some providers who will step out of the space, and some new providers will step in. But it has not changed our practice. It has not changed our intention to continue to practice,\" Foster said.\n\nMAP uses an organizational structure designed to spread potential liability, Foster said.\n\n\"The person who orders the pills is different than the person who prescribes the pills, is different from the person who ships the pills, is different from the person who does the payments,\" she explained.\n\nThe eight states that shield doctors who provide abortion care via telemedicine also have laws that safeguard doctors who provide in-person abortion care, according to a review of shield laws by the Center on Reproductive Health, Law, and Policy at the UCLA School of Law.\n\nAnother 14 states, most of which are controlled by Democrats, have either shield laws or executive orders that protect doctors who perform in-person care in that state — but not when they provide abortion care via telemedicine, the review found.\n\nMost of these shield laws address extradition or investigations of physicians in both civil and criminal cases. Carpenter was already facing a Texas lawsuit, filed in December, when Louisiana announced its criminal indictment.\n\nIn February, on the same day New York's governor rejected Louisiana's extradition request, a Texas judge ordered Carpenter to pay more than $100,000 in penalties for prescribing abortion pills to a woman near Dallas.\n\nThe shield laws are meant to protect doctors like Carpenter— as long as they stay in their home state. But if they travel elsewhere, they lose that law's protection.\n\nThese physicians accept there are parts of the country they can no longer visit, said Julie F. Kay, a human rights lawyer who helps doctors set up telemedicine practices.\n\nKay has worked with Carpenter; together they co-founded the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, along with one other physician.\n\n\"There's really a commitment not to visit those banned and restricted states,\" said Kay. \"We didn't have anybody going to the Super Bowl or Mardi Gras or anything like that. I've talked to doctors where it's not a good fit because they have an elderly parent in Florida, or a college student somewhere, or family in the South.\"\n\nGovernors clash over doctor's fate\n\nCarpenter's case remains unresolved. Legal experts interviewed by NPR say New York's refusal to extradite shows the state's shield law is working exactly as designed. But Louisiana officials have forcefully hit back in social media posts and media interviews.\n\n\"It is not any different than if she had sent fentanyl here. It's really not,\" Louisiana's Attorney General Liz Murrill told Fox 8 News in New Orleans. \"She sent drugs that are illegal to send into our state.\"\n\nTony Clayton is the Louisiana DA who brought the charges.\n\n\"I firmly believe that a denial of an extradition request from another governor is just a ministerial act, that we plan on challenging Governor Hochul,\" Clayton said. \"When the proper requests are made, she refuses to turn over [Carpenter], we will deal with that accordingly.\"\n\nLouisiana could challenge New York's law in federal courts, according to legal experts across the political spectrum, but has not yet taken that step. Clayton declined to say if Louisiana would do that.\n\nCase highlights fraught new legal frontier\n\nThe new shield laws challenge the basic fabric of U.S. law, which relies on reciprocity between states, including in criminal cases, said Thomas Jipping, a senior legal fellow with The Heritage Foundation, which supports a national abortion ban.\n\n\"This actually tries to undermine another state's ability to enforce its own laws, and that's a very grave challenge to this tradition in our country,\" Jipping said. \"It's unclear what legal issues, or potentially constitutional issues, it may raise.\"\n\nBut other legal scholars disagree. The Constitution only requires extradition for those who commit crimes in one state and then flee to another, said David Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University's Thomas R. Kline School of Law.\n\nTelemedicine abortion providers aren't located in states with bans, and have not fled them — therefore they aren't required to be extradited, Cohen explained. If Louisiana tries to take their case to federal court, \"they're going to lose because the Constitution is clear on this.\"\n\n\"The shield laws certainly do undermine the notion of interstate cooperation and comity and respect for the policy choices of each state, but that has long been a part of American law and history,\" Cohen said.\n\n\"Different states make different policy choices, and sometimes they're willing to give up those policy choices to cooperate with another state, and sometimes they're not,\" he added.\n\nThe conflicting legal theories would be put to the test if and when this case comes to federal court, other legal scholars have said.\n\n\"It probably puts New York and Louisiana in real conflict, potentially a conflict that the Supreme Court is going to have to decide,\" said Rachel Rebouché, the dean of the Temple University Beasley School of Law.\n\nRebouché worked with Cohen and another law professor, Greer Donley, to draft the first proposal for a shield law, and they helped pass the first such law in Connecticut, though it does not include telemedicine protections.\n\nIt was signed by the state's governor in May 2022, before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, in anticipation of potential clashes between states over abortion rights.\n\n\"What if states want to punish providers in other states who are providing abortions that are legal where they are, but not legal in the banned state? And that's really where the idea of a shield law came about,\" Rebouché said.\n\nHealth care provided through telemedicine is typically considered to be located where the patient receives that care.\n\nBut telemedicine shield laws explicitly seek to protect physicians regardless of the patient's location by creating a category of \"legally protected reproductive health activity.\" Rebouche said by protecting a physician engaging in telemedicine, the laws have the effect of shifting the location of care to the physician's state.\n\nSome states may add more legal protections for abortion providers\n\nCarpenter was charged because her name was found on the mailed prescription, Clayton told NPR.\n\nAfter the indictment, New York passed a new law that allows physicians to put their clinic's name — and not their own — on abortion prescriptions they mail out of state. The intent is to make it more difficult to indict individual doctors.\n\nDer Siomonian is pushing for a similar law Maine.\n\nDr. Samantha Glass is a family medicine physician in New York who has experience writing prescriptions for telemedicine abortions. She also travels to a clinic in Kansas about once a month to perform abortions.\n\nCarpenter's indictment could cause some doctors to stop sending pills to states with bans, she said. But Glass believes abortion should be as accessible as any other health care, she said, and plans on joining a New York practice that sends pills across state lines.\n\n\"Someone has to do it. So why wouldn't it be me?\" Glass said. \"I just think access to this care is such a life saving thing for so many people, that I just couldn't turn my back on it.\"",

        "full_text": "Greenland’s prime minister, Múte B Egede, has called for the international community to step in after it was announced that Donald Trump’s national security adviser and the US second lady will visit the Arctic island, accusing Washington of “foreign interference”.\n\nMike Waltz and Usha Vance are due to arrive in Greenland this week as part of a delegation that will also include the US energy secretary, Chris Wright.\n\nTrump has pledged to make the autonomous territory – part of the kingdom of Denmark, which ruled Greenland as a colony until 1953 and continues to control its foreign and security policy – part of the US, “one way or the other” and has refused to rule out using military or economic force to do so.\n\nA spokesperson for the Danish police said they had sent extra personnel and sniffer dogs to Greenland as they step up security measures before the visit. René Gyldensten said the extra officers, deployed on Sunday, were part of regular steps taken during visits by dignitaries but declined to specify the number of extra police flown in on a chartered aircraft. News reports put the figure at dozens.\n\nGreenlandic parties are currently in coalition talks after an election less than a fortnight ago in which the country voted for a complete overhaul of its government, with the Democrats replacing Egede’s party, Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA), as the biggest party in the Inatsisartut, the Greenlandic parliament.\n\nEgede reacted angrily to the White House announcement on Sunday, accusing Greenland’s allies of “hiding” and “almost whispering” their support. If the international community did not step up its support for Greenland, he warned, the situation would escalate.\n\n“Yes, the western allies stood together and helped each other through thick and thin, but it has turned upside down now with the sitting president in the USA,” he told the Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq.\n\n“But the fact that our other allies in the international community feel like hiding in a small corner and almost whispering that they support us has no effect, and if they do not speak out loudly about how the USA is treating Greenland, the situation will escalate day by day, and the American aggression will increase.”\n\nHe added: “So we need our other allies to clearly and distinctly come with their support and backing for us.”\n\nJens-Frederik Nielsen, the leader of Greenland’s Democrats, who is expected to become the next prime minister, called for calm and said they would continue to take the time needed to reach a “solid and sustainable political agreement”. He accused the US of a “lack of respect” in planning the visit while coalition talks were still happening.\n\n“The visit, which is said to be ‘private’, is pure charm offensive, and if we allow ourselves to be influenced by it, for example by rushing to form a new coalition, we may become even more vulnerable to pressure,” Nielsen told Sermitsiaq.\n\n“So let’s cool our nerves and maintain our common goal of showing the outside world that our country is not a commodity, and that we have sovereignty over the country, which must be respected and no one can take it away from us.”\n\nThe Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said on Sunday that the planned visit “cannot be seen independently of the public statements that have been made”. She added: “In the kingdom, we want to cooperate with the Americans. But it must be a cooperation that is based on the fundamental values ​​of sovereignty and respect between countries and peoples …\n\n“This is something we are looking at seriously. The dialogue with the US regarding Greenland will take place in close coordination between the Danish government and the future Greenlandic government.”\n\nAnnouncing the trip on Sunday, the second lady’s office said Vance would visit Greenland together with her son and a US delegation from Thursday to Saturday this week. The White House later announced that Waltz and Wright would visit the US military base in Greenland, Pituffik, for briefings from US personnel. They are expected to join Vance to visit historical sites and attend a dog sled race.",

The battles with the remnants of Hamas and Hezbollah come as a showdown with Iran and its nuclear program looms over the Middle East.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces struck dozens of Hezbollah rocket launcher sites on Saturday in the largest attack since the ceasefire. The attacks follow a rocket launch from southern Lebanon toward the Galilee. Israel called it a blatant violation of the ceasefire. Hezbollah denies they were responsible but the IDF claims the terror group continues to operate in the area.\n\nIn Gaza, the renewed military operation is expanding as another IDF division prepares to enter the fighting. The operations have been ongoing since the end of the ceasefire and the refusal by Israel to continue any negotiations while \"under fire.\"\n\nDuring the recent fighting, the IDF eliminated two prominent Hamas leaders.\n\nWhile visiting an IDF Armored Corps regiment on Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared, \"We are winning because we understand that in order to defeat our enemies, those who are closing in on us, we break through them with crushing ground force, in addition to the excellent work of the Air Force, Intelligence, (the) Navy and of course the Infantry.”\n\nU.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff blames Hamas for the collapse of the negotiations to free more hostages. “I was in Doha. I met with many of the leaders at the Arab summit. I thought we had a deal, an acceptable deal. I even thought we had an approval from Hamas. Maybe that's me just getting duped,\" Witkoff admitted while appearing on Fox News Sunday.\n\nHe added, “So, this is on Hamas. The United States stands with the State of Israel.

Iran has to give up its program in a way that the entire world can see,\" Waltz told CBS Face the Nation on Sunday. \"And this is, as President Trump has said, this is coming to a head. All options are on the table and it is time for Iran to walk away completely from its desire to have a nuclear weapon.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Israeli cabinet voted unanimously this weekend on a no-confidence vote to dismiss Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, whom the Netanyahu government believes is undermining the prime minister and his policies.\n\nThe unprecedented vote follows the firing of Ronen Bar, the head of the Shin Bet, Israel's version of the F.B.I. Thousands of Israelis took to the streets to protest the firing, while many Israelis believe the prime minister has both the authority and the reasons to dismiss Bar.",

        "full_text": "President Donald Trump is escalating his multi-front assault on what supporters see as an elite establishment, using raw presidential power to bend the government, law, media, public health, foreign policy, education and even the arts to his will.\n\nTrump left no doubt in last year’s campaign that he’d use executive authority to seek retribution against his political enemies. But his attempt to transform America’s politics and culture is far broader than a personal revenge trip.\n\nHe’s targeting Ivy League universities; using executive authority against top law firms; eviscerating the bureaucracy; rejecting 80 years of elite orthodoxy about American global leadership; and using tariffs to shatter the global trading system that Make America Great Again proponents regard as the self-enriching treachery of global elites.\n\nIn one recent example, the White House forced Columbia University to restrict demonstrations, review its Middle East curriculum, ban masks in protests and stiffen law enforcement. Other top educational institutions now feel vulnerable to possible attempts to impose Trump dogma. The strategy may widen the political opening created by conservative pressure on top colleges over anti-Israel protests amid the war in Gaza.\n\nAnd late last week, Trump directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek sanctions against lawyers and law firms who engage in what he regards as “frivolous, unreasonable, and vexatious litigation against the United States.” The memo was released after he canceled punishment against one top white-collar firm after the White House said it agreed to do $40 million in pro bono legal services to support administration initiatives and promised to drop diversity, equity and inclusion. The firm — Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison — disputes the administration’s characterization of the agreement, but the deal caused a backlash among many Washington lawyers.\n\nTrump’s broad strategy pulsates with the anti-establishment energy that animated his rowdy campaign rallies, and is part of a deeper attempt to destroy what critics see as a liberal in-crowd that dominates Washington governance and global power in the West with what many conservatives see as more authentic American values. This aspiration lies behind the president’s gutting of the Department of Education, which has long been viewed by Republicans as a tool of Democratic-backed teachers’ unions and a lever for more inclusive gender, race and inclusion policies that many conservatives oppose.\n\nTrump’s choice of education secretary, Linda McMahon — who lacks background in the field but made a fortune promoting theatrical, choreographed bouts of professional wrestling — is itself a rebuke to the education establishment. McMahon explained her mission to downgrade her department to CNN’s Dana Bash Sunday on “State of the Union”: “The Department of Education does not educate one child. It does not establish any curriculum in any states. It doesn’t hire teachers. It doesn’t establish programs,” she said, vowing to send federal funds directly to states.\n\nMcMahon’s appointment springs from the same elite-bashing sentiments that led Trump to name Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic, to head the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nTrump is trying to change America’s culture as well as its politics\n\nTrump’s politics has long been hostile to intellectualism. And a president who was mocked by the establishment for years is now using his second administration to settle scores.\n\nBut his attempt to bring universities, the media and the medical establishment into line is raising fears for academic and press freedom and the sanctity of science in public health. And his ambitions go further — he’s even taken control of the Kennedy Center in Washington, put Fox News anchors on its board and promised to replace high culture with more mainstream programming.\n\nThis is all consistent with a president who draws most support from outside America’s cities and wealthy middle-class suburbs; and who believes he has a mandate for transformation after winning all seven swing states and the popular vote in 2024. It also speaks to the revolution he led in the Republican Party, which has shed its establishment past and now channels working-class constituencies that used to be Democratic.\n\nBut the administration’s latest actions also have dark parallels to the tactics of strongman leaders whose assaults on academia, the media, the law, and business led to the shriveling of basic freedoms, democracy and the proliferation of oligarchical corruption — for instance in Hungary under Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, a hero of the MAGA movement.\n\nTrump’s ultra-nationalist instincts and admiration for dictators such as Russian President Vladimir Putin — a rebuke to generations of US establishment foreign policy directed against Kremlin expansionism — is calling into doubt the international system built by national security elites after World War II and the system of alliances with democracies that are the foundation of US global power.\n\nAnd his administration’s insistence that what it regards as an elite liberal corps of district court judges don’t have the right to interpret the Constitution in a way that constrains the power of an all-powerful president is now encroaching on the rule of law in America, even if the White House is yet to challenge the Supreme Court — perhaps in the belief that its conservative majority will validate some of the president’s own worldview.\n\nHow the MAGA project believes leftist elites compromise American greatness\n\nTrump sketched out his approach in multiple policy areas in his searing inaugural address, which was a statement of intent to ensure his second term will impose the kind of fundamental change that his first failed to enshrine and of the belief that he was “saved by God to make America great again.”\n\nIn Trump’s eyes, that greatness has been compromised by leftist elite policies that shattered domestic manufacturing, suppressed freedom with public health mandates, inflicted radical liberal values in education, allowed unchecked migration, caused weakness abroad and allowed America’s friends to exploit its generosity. “For many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair,” Trump said after he was sworn in.\n\nHis program mirrors the goals of Project 2025, the playbook for conservative presidential leadership that Trump disowned during his campaign but that now helps explain the policy decisions of his administration. “The next conservative president must possess the courage to relentlessly put the interests of the everyday American over the desires of the ruling elite,” Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts wrote in the foreword of the document. “Their outrage cannot be prevented; it must simply be ignored, and it can be.”\n\nThe synergy between Trump’s desire to punish sources of power that he believes have wronged him and the wider administration attempt to neutralize any attempt to neutralize constraints drove his showdown with big law firms Paul, Weiss. The president signed an executive order that suspended security clearances for the firm’s attorneys — a move that could have hampered its capacity to do act in cases that intersect with the federal government. The order was consistent with the president’s attempt to end what he calls the “weaponization” of justice — by targeting lawyers or firms that previously took part in prosecutions against him.\n\nIn a letter to Paul, Weiss employees, the firm’s chairman Brad Karp explained his decision to deal with the president, warning that the executive order could have “easily have destroyed our firm. It brought the full weight of the government down on our firm, our people, and our clients.”\n\nBut the company’s decision provoked wider worries that the president will use his power to threaten law firms with ruin if they act on behalf of his opponents.\n\nAdministration claims liberal judges are illegitimate\n\nTrump’s attempts to bring legal elites in private firms to heel mirror his assault on another establishment the president is trying to disempower — the federal judiciary. This is highlighted by his attacks on a US federal judge who sought to halt deportations of alleged gang members that the White House carried out under the rarely used Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Judge James Boasberg is trying to find out whether the administration flouted his orders to halt the deportations last weekend. His efforts have sparked the extraordinary spectacle of an attorney general directly attacking his legitimacy.\n\n“This is an out-of-control judge, a federal judge trying to control our entire foreign policy. And he cannot do it,” Bondi said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures,” which is presented by Maria Bartiromo — one of the Fox anchors Trump elevated to the board of the Kennedy Center. “They’re not immigrants. They’re illegal aliens who are committing the most violent crimes you can imagine on Americans, murder, rapes,” Bondi said of Venezuelans deported to a draconian El Salvador prison run by dictator Nayib Bukele, which has raised human rights concerns.\n\nThe administration’s use of a national security argument as justification for the deportations, which Trump claims are part of a Venezuelan invasion, may be designed to chill the judge’s attempts to gain clarity. While Bondi said those deported were criminals, the administration has so far not provided any case-by-case details on those involved. CNN has so far been unable to establish that any of the migrants belonged to the Tren de Aragua gang, which the administration said was the reason for the deportations.\n\nTrump’s aides keep arguing that Boasberg is a liberal judge. But he was first appointed by Republican President George W. Bush and then promoted by President Barack Obama. He has a long reputation as a nonpartisan judge. The claims that only Trump-appointed judges are fit to rule on Trump administration policies threaten to destroy the foundation of the legal system.\n\nThe deportations are one of the most prominent examples of the administration’s habit to applying vast executive power in an apparent attempt to outrun the capacity of the courts or its political opponents to impose constraints in real time.\n\nBut the ambition of leaving existing sources of elite power in Washington in tatters runs through all of the administration’s goals — from the seizure of control of the White House press pool from journalists to include pro-Trump outlets to trashing generations of US bipartisan policy with threats to annex Canada while officials repeatedly parrot Russian propaganda on Ukraine.",

        "full_text": "Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino.\n\nLegal experts say there is nothing to President Donald Trump’s claims that several of former President Joe Biden’s pardons are “VOID” because they were signed via autopen.\n\nWhite House lawyers during the George W. Bush administration said the use of an autopen is perfectly legal, and constitutional scholars say that nothing in the Constitution even requires pardons to be signed anyway. And, they note, pardons cannot simply be overturned by a subsequent president.\n\nTrump is correct that pardons would be invalid if, in fact, as he has claimed, any pardons were signed by a staffer without Biden’s knowledge or consent. But Trump has offered no evidence of that.\n\nTrump has repeatedly invoked the autopen issue in the last several days. As NPR explains, autopen is “a generic name for a machine that duplicates signatures using real ink, making it easy for public figures to autograph everything from correspondence to merchandise in bulk. They are printer-sized machines with an arm that can hold a standard pen or pencil, and use it to replicate the programmed signature on a piece of paper below.” Trump acknowledged that he himself uses an autopen, but “only for very unimportant papers.”\n\nIn a post to Truth Social on March 17, Trump claimed that some pardons issued by Biden were “hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen.” He specifically put members of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol on notice that “they are subject to investigation at the highest level.”\n\nBiden’s Late-Term Pardons\n\nOn Jan. 19, a day before he left office, Biden issued a series of preemptive pardons for members of Congress who served on the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack, staff of the committee and law enforcement officials who provided testimony to the committee. (Preemptive pardons are extended to people who have not been formally charged with a crime and are meant to shield them from potential prosecution.) That day, Biden also preemptively pardoned Gen. Mark Milley, Dr. Anthony Fauci and several of Biden’s family members.\n\nBiden has used an autopen in the past, albeit rarely, according to a 2024 CNN story that said staffers flew legislation to South Korea and St. Croix to ensure Biden could personally sign the bills. We could not independently confirm whether the pardons in question were signed via autopen.\n\nTrump has said that members of the Jan. 6 committee — including Rep. Bennie Thompson, who chaired the committee, and then-Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, Republicans on the committee — illegally “destroyed evidence and deleted everything” and “they should be punished.” (As we have written, claims that the committee destroyed “all the evidence” are wrong.)\n\nBut legal scholars say there are several problems with Trump’s claim that using an autopen would nullify these pardons. For starters, they say, presidents don’t need to sign pardons for them to be official.\n\nArticle 2, Section 2, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution states that the president “shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States.” It makes no mention of needing a signature to issue pardons, which stands in contrast to the Constitution’s requirement that a president sign a bill in order to make it a law.\n\n“Nothing in the Constitution requires the president to sign pardons by hand,” Jeffrey Crouch, a professor at American University and author of the book “The Presidential Pardon Power,” told us via email.\n\nA 2024 ruling in a case before the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed. On the question of whether a signature is required for a president to exercise clemency, the court said, “The answer is undoubtedly no. The plain language of the Constitution imposes no such limit, broadly providing that the President ‘shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.’ … The constitutional text is thus silent as to any particular form the President’s clemency act must take to be effective.”\n\nMoreover, Crouch said, “The practice of using an autopen to sign presidential pardons seems perfectly legitimate.”\n\nIndeed, other presidents have used an autopen. Former President Barack Obama was believed to be the first to use it to sign legislation in 2011 when, while in France, he used an autopen to extend the Patriot Act. Then-Rep. Tom Graves, a Republican, wrote Obama a letter asking him to confirm that the bill was “presented” to him “prior to the autopen signing.” We couldn’t find that the White House responded.\n\nA White House Legal Opinion\n\nKermit Roosevelt, a constitutional law professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, told us that the White House Office of Legal Counsel “has opined, based on the original understanding of ‘sign,’ that the president can delegate the act of signing. So autopens are fine.”\n\nIn 2005, the White House Office of Legal Counsel, at the request of then-President George W. Bush, looked into the issue. After a review of the Constitution and other legal opinions, it concluded “that the President need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become law. Rather, the President may sign a bill within the meaning of Article I, Section 7 by directing a subordinate to affix the President’s signature to such a bill, for example by autopen.”\n\n“We emphasize that we are not suggesting that the President may delegate the decision to approve and sign a bill, only that, having made this decision, he may direct a subordinate to affix the President’s signature to the bill,” Howard C. Nielson Jr., deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel, wrote in the legal opinion.\n\nAnd that gets to the second issue Trump raised: whether Biden was aware of or had instructed a subordinate to approve the pardons.\n\nIn a press conference on March 17, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said, “The president was begging the question that I think a lot of journalists in this room should be asking about whether or not the former president of the United States who I think we can all finally agree was cognitively impaired. … But the president was raising the point that did the president [Biden] even know about these pardons? Was his legal signature used without his consent or knowledge? … So I think it’s a question that everybody in this room should be looking into because certainly that would propose perhaps criminal or illegal behavior if staff members were signing the president of the United States’ autograph without his consent.”\n\nIn interviews after his Truth Social post, Trump argued that Biden was “grossly incompetent” and that pardons he signed in his final days in office were “null and void because I’m sure Biden didn’t have any idea that it was taking place.” He acknowledged that ultimately, whether the pardons are illegitimate is “not my decision. That’ll be up to court.”\n\nHowever, neither Trump nor Leavitt has offered any evidence that Biden did not know about or approve the pardons.\n\n“The president can’t delegate the decision of whether to sign, or whether to grant a pardon,” Roosevelt said. “A pardon granted without the president’s knowledge is invalid. But there’s no reason to think that’s what happened here—Biden spoke publicly about the pardons.”\n\nBiden’s Public Comments\n\nWhile we could not find that Biden spoke publicly about the Jan. 19 pardons after they were issued, he did share publicly, in the days preceding the pardons, that he was considering them.\n\nIn an interview on Jan. 5, for example, USA Today’s Susan Page asked Biden, “Some of your supporters have encouraged you to issue preemptive pardons to people like Liz Cheney and Anthony Fauci, who Trump has threatened to target. Will you do that?”\n\n“Well, a little bit of it depends on who he puts in what positions,” Biden said. He said that in a post-election conversation with Trump, “I tried to make it clear that there was no need, and it was counterintuitive for his interest to go back and try to settle scores.” But Biden said Trump did not commit to that.\n\nAnd during remarks on Jan. 10, a reporter asked what pardons Biden was considering in his last 10 days in office.\n\n“One is that it depends on some of the language and expectations that Trump broadcasts in the last couple of days here as to what he’s going to do,” Biden said. “The idea that he would punish people for not adhering to what he thinks should be policy as related to his well-being is outrageous, but there is still consideration of some folks, but no decision.”\n\nThose comments are consistent with a Biden statement released by the White House on Jan. 20 explaining some of his 11th-hour pardons.\n\n“Our nation relies on dedicated, selfless public servants every day. They are the lifeblood of our democracy,” Biden stated. “Yet alarmingly, public servants have been subjected to ongoing threats and intimidation for faithfully discharging their duties.\n\n“In certain cases, some have even been threatened with criminal prosecutions, including General Mark A. Milley, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, and the members and staff of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol,” Biden said. “These public servants have served our nation with honor and distinction and do not deserve to be the targets of unjustified and politically motivated prosecutions.”\n\nMembers of the Jan. 6 committee acted with “integrity and a commitment to discovering the truth,” Biden said. “Rather than accept accountability, those who perpetrated the January 6th attack have taken every opportunity to undermine and intimidate those who participated in the Select Committee in an attempt to rewrite history, erase the stain of January 6th for partisan gain, and seek revenge, including by threatening criminal prosecutions.”\n\n“Even when individuals have done nothing wrong—and in fact have done the right thing—and will ultimately be exonerated, the mere fact of being investigated or prosecuted can irreparably damage reputations and finances,” Biden stated, explaining that this was his reason for issuing the preemptive pardons. “The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that any individual engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense.”\n\nTrump can’t simply revoke pardons issued by Biden, experts told us.\n\n“A completed pardon is not able to be revoked,” Crouch said. “If it was, then any sitting president could try to revoke pardons granted by their predecessors. A president who can undo the clemency decisions of their predecessors would weaken the clemency power for every president.”",

        "full_text": "Yet nearly every key decision remains unsettled. They include how deep to cut into social safety-net spending, how to placate swing-seat lawmakers over a key tax break, how to account for the cost of extending existing tax cuts and how many more breaks they can pile on top.\n\n“How can we be moving quickly when some of those foundational questions haven’t been settled?” North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis said about the rising pressure from the House GOP.\n\nTo help break the deadlock, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and top Trump economic adviser Kevin Hassett are set to huddle again Tuesday with GOP leaders and tax writers as they try to reconcile the two chambers’ diverging plans. On several fronts, the Senate is looking for cues on how to proceed from the House and vice versa, creating a chicken-and-egg situation that has resulted in a quiet standoff between the two chambers.\n\nUnderscoring the firm views on either side, Johnson and other top House GOP leaders issued a joint statement Monday calling on the Senate to “take up the House budget resolution” upon their return to the Capitol. “The American people gave us a mandate and we must act on it,” they said.\n\nThat has many Republicans viewing Johnson’s budget goal — already a retreat from his prior ambition of getting a final bill through the House before Easter — as deeply aspirational. Senate Republicans want to have something to show for all their private deliberations before they leave again in April. Though their leadership has been careful not to offer any public deadlines, a person granted anonymity to discuss internal deliberations said the goal is to adopt a modified budget resolution before the Senate leaves again in three weeks.\n\n“I’d like to have done it yesterday, but really I just don’t find it helpful to set timelines,” said Senate Finance Chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), who is tasked with negotiating the tax portion of the package.\n\nDriving the caution on the Senate side is widespread skepticism among GOP senators that the House can deliver on a bill that meets the budget it adopted last month — particularly its goal of $2 trillion in spending cuts. While House Republicans are prodding their Senate counterparts to just adopt what they sent over, senators have made clear they will make changes.\n\nThey are also wary of going through another marathon voting slog — especially on a framework that will likely require politically perilous Medicaid cuts — without proof that it can result in a passable bill, according to three Republicans involved in the talks who were granted anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\n\nBut there’s a Catch-22: House Republicans, including Johnson’s tax writers on the Ways and Means Committee, don’t intend to draft a bill before the Senate agrees on a fiscal outline.\n\n“How can we do that without knowing the Senate number?” said one House GOP lawmaker granted anonymity to speak candidly.\n\n“That’s not how this works,” a senior House GOP aide concurred.\n\nMeanwhile, the two top leaders are working through unique headaches. Johnson is facing off with conservative hard-liners who not only want the Senate to swallow the House budget whole but are now pushing for a doomed and messy impeachment fight with judges who have ruled against Trump.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, meanwhile, needs to hammer out complex tax disputes among his own members. Republicans are checking in with the nonpartisan parliamentarian — the Capitol Hill official who referees budget policy — on whether they can use a controversial accounting tactic that would allow them to effectively zero out the roughly $4 trillion cost of extending Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. That’s not to mention the widespread heartburn Thune is dealing with inside his conference over the impact of potential Medicaid cuts.\n\nThune and Johnson are in frequent contact, with Johnson publicly floating holding a “little conference” to hammer out the differences between the two chambers. Thune is meeting with small groups of senators to take their temperature, including with members of the tax-writing Finance Committee.\n\nBut frustrations are rising amid what’s likely to be several more months of complex tax discussions.\n\n“Talk, talk, talk, talk,” Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said upon returning to the Capitol from a March 13 White House meeting with Trump and Senate Finance Republicans. “Just like the last 10 weeks.”\n\nWhile many Republicans insist they will eventually get on the same page, there’s no clear plan for how or when that will happen — and plenty of finger-pointing over who is ultimately responsible for doing so.\n\nAdding to the complications is the fact that many rank-and-file House Republicans want senators to rein in their own chamber’s budget plan, despite the calls from their leadership for the Senate to do the opposite.\n\nVulnerable House members said they received assurances from GOP leaders that the level of Medicaid cuts required under the House budget framework wouldn’t make it through the Senate. They made similar assurances regarding the $230 billion in potential cuts to the country’s largest anti-hunger program.\n\nHouse Energy and Commerce Chair Brett Guthrie, whose panel has been tasked with making $880 billion of cuts, said he’s waiting to see what the Senate will do before proposing specific changes to Medicaid or other programs under his jurisdiction.\n\n“We have to have instructions before we can do anything,” he said. “That’s just the system.”\n\nTrump green-lit changes to Medicaid during a meeting with Senate Finance Committee members earlier this month, including mandating work requirements and going after “waste,” according to Republican senators who attended the meeting. But any perceived cuts to benefits stands to spark backlash inside the GOP, and the size of the Energy and Commerce instruction — calibrated to placate House hard-liners — has many doubting those cuts are avoidable.\n\nOn the revenue side, many House tax writers privately acknowledge they need the Senate to modify the House budget blueprint to allow for more priorities that the president continues to push, including income tax exemptions for tips, overtime and Social Security benefits.\n\nGOP members of the House Ways and Means Committee met for two days of meetings to discuss those and a slew of other potential tax provisions before leaving for recess. The group worked through various proposals, using red, yellow and green cards to express their opinions on each one, according to three people granted anonymity to discuss the private meetings.\n\nAmong the longest-running and thorniest issues yet to be resolved: how to placate key blue-state Republicans who want an expansion of the income tax deduction for state and local taxes.\n\nThe array of unsettled disputes has contributed to a sense of bemused frustration among many lawmakers, many of whom are waiting on their leaders — and Trump — to get more aggressive about resolving them.\n\n“Probably what we are going to do is talk each other to death, stare at each other and then eventually, you know, confuse the issue so much that it takes two months to unravel what we agree to,” said GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky.",

        "full_text": "Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) has cautioned GOP colleagues that the Senate isn’t likely to pass President Trump’s border security, energy and tax agenda until July at the earliest, and some Republican senators are warning the bill could drag well into the fall.\n\nMuch of Washington’s attention has focused on the rocky path Trump’s agenda faces in the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson’s (R-La.) slim majority means he can only lose one GOP vote and still pass GOP legislation.\n\nBut Republican senators are warning that getting a major package through the Senate will take months longer than has been publicly discussed, due to the sheer size of Trump’s ambitious agenda and internal Republican divisions over an array of policy questions.\n\nWhile Thune has told Republican senators he wants to move a budget resolution in the “next work period” before the April recess to show progress on Trump’s agenda, the “finished product” is still months away.\n\n“Thune and others have said they don’t think it’s realistic we’ll move the finished product until the end of July,” a Republican senator said of Thune’s projected timeline for moving Trump’s agenda.\n\n“Thune said he thought that the House’s timeline on this was totally unrealistic and that the House doesn’t have their ducks in a row, and their budget resolution has to be completely reworked, and this idea that we do it by April or May is just ridiculous,” the source said.\n\nJohnson said in January that House Republican leaders were “targeting April” for final passage of a budget reconciliation package that would extend the expiring 2017 tax cuts and address border security, energy reform and defense spendings.\n\nJohnson told CNBC in a March 12 interview that he put the reconciliation bill “on a very aggressive timetable for the very important reason that we need to get to the certainty [for the business environment] as soon as possible.”\n\n“I’ve put on an aggressive timetable to try to get a vote on the one big, beautiful bill, the reconciliation package, on the House floor before Easter. If we do that, you’re pushing it over to the Senate for them to act upon — it’s conceivable you could get this to the president’s desk by the end of April or early May. Certainly before Memorial Day,” he said.\n\nRepublican senators, however, say that timeline is totally unrealistic given internal party divisions on tax policy, defense spending and proposed cuts to entitlement spending.\n\nA second Republican senator said Senate Republican leadership has warned that the reconciliation package may not get passed until late July or even September.\n\n“Thune’s been having these small-group discussions, [and] in the one I was in, Senate Republicans were all over the map. There was no consensus,” the GOP senator warned.\n\nThe lawmaker predicted the lack of consensus among Senate Republicans may require the House take the lead to keep Trump’s agenda from being delayed into the fall.\n\n“I’m hoping that the House has a little clearer meeting of the minds than we do,” the source said.\n\nSenate Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said last month that the House-passed budget needed “a major overhaul” before it could pass the Senate.\n\nMost Republican senators support adopting Senate Finance Committee Chair Mike Crapo’s (R-Idaho) strategy of using a “current policy” baseline to estimate the cost of the reconciliation package, which wouldn’t count an extension of the expiring 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as adding to the deficit.\n\nBut there are a few dissenters within the Senate Republican Conference who worry that simply coming up with a way to score an extension of the tax cuts as deficit-neutral wouldn’t accurately reflect the fiscal impact of the legislation.\n\nSemafor reported earlier this month that Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.) have raised questions behind the scenes about using Crapo’s “current policy” baseline to project the cost of the reconciliation package.\n\nCassidy has expressed his concern about projected federal deficits and their impact on interest rates.\n\nIn addition to the disagreement over how to score the extension of the 2017 tax cuts, GOP lawmakers need to decide what additional tax cuts to put in the package.\n\nHouse Republicans from high-income, high-tax blue states want to lift the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions.\n\nAnd earlier this month, Trump renewed his call for Congress to exempt tipped income and Social Security benefits from taxation. Those proposals could cost up to $200 billion and $1.5 trillion over 10 years, respectively.\n\nGraham said he’s still hoping to pass the reconciliation package through the Senate before the August recess.\n\n“I think that’s the goal. I hope so,” he said.\n\nCrapo, who’s leading the negotiations on the tax portion of the package, declined to predict how long the talks might take.\n\n“I can’t tell you how close we are,” he said.\n\nAnother major stumbling block is the instruction in the House-passed budget resolution to the House Energy and Commerce Committee to reduce the federal deficit by $880 billion over 10 years.\n\nBudget experts say that while the language does not mention Medicaid specifically, the only way to meet that target is to make huge cuts to the program, which pays for the medical services of low-income and disabled people, as well as nursing home costs for many seniors.\n\nRepublican senators including Sens. Josh Hawley (Mo.), John Boozman (Ark.) and Jim Justice (W.Va.) have either expressed opposition to deep Medicaid cuts or have emphasized the importance of the program to many of their constituents.\n\n“I would not do severe cuts to Medicaid,” Hawley told HuffPost in February.\n\n“I don’t like the idea of massive Medicaid cuts,” he said.\n\nBoozman told The Hill that Medicaid cuts “sure would” impact constituents in Arkansas.\n\n“It depends what they’re going to do,” he said, noting the House-passed budget resolution doesn’t detail explicitly what mandatory spending programs will be cut.\n\n“We don’t have $800 billion in cuts in play right now. It’s what the House wants to do,” he said. “What I’ll be concerned about is the final negotiated process, which we’re a long way from.”\n\nJustice told reporters Thursday that many West Virginians depend on Medicaid but added that he would support reforms that strengthen the solvency of the program.\n\n“From the standpoint of Medicaid, West Virginia has a gigantic participation. Really and truly we have concerns, and we’re going to have to watch as this thing filters all the way through,” he said of the reconciliation package.\n\n“At the same time, we know there’s waste like we can’t imagine,” he said. “We can try as best we possibly can to make the right moves on the chessboard to fix it or to make it better.”\n\nDefense spending is a third major point of disagreement.\n\nThe House-passed budget proposal calls for a $100 billion direct spending increase for defense needs, but Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) says that’s inadequate to build up the defense industrial base to meet the growing threat posed by China and other adversaries.\n\nWicker wants the reconciliation package to include at least $175 billion for defense programs.\n\nHe said he voted for the continuing resolution to fund the government until Sept. 30 despite what he saw as its failure to meet the Pentagon’s needs, because of the expectation that the reconciliation package would make up for the shortfall.\n\n“We’re going to need more than $150 billion in the reconciliation bill, if we’re going to be able to defend the country,” he said. “It needs to be well over $150 billion. We’re looking north of $175 [billion].”",

        "full_text": "Pity poor John Roberts. No, he’s not corrupt or compromised. He is simply a man who has found himself at a pivotal time and place in a position of great responsibility for which he is utterly unsuited. He’s not a dumb man. He is, in fact, a very smart man – Hugh Hewitt knew him personally in the Reagan administration and testifies to that. I have no doubt it’s true. I know many smart people who have similar flaws. As objectively intelligent as John Roberts is, he is unwise, and he is endangering the institution he wants to preserve because he does not understand human nature or the times he finds himself in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrankly, I’ll take wisdom over raw intellect any day of the week.\n\nIf he had the capacity to lead that he so manifestly lacks, John Roberts could save his institution with decisive and bold action. But that’s not who he is. Understand what John Roberts wants. He is an institutionalist who has always wanted to protect the judiciary branch. He wants it to be a fully co-equal branch that is respected by all. But the veryactions he has chosen to take – or not to take – in response to the current crisis of out-of-control subordinate courts are guaranteeing that it will fall.\n\nArticle III of our Constitution provides for the judicial branch, but it does notexpresslyprovide the judiciary with any powers other than those it earns in the eyes of the other two branches.It cannot self-enforce its decrees.Article I creates the Congress, and the legislative branch has both the power of the purse and the power to impeach to check the judiciary. Article II establishes the presidency, but the Constitution does not specify its checks and balances over the court. That power is implied, and the implied power is for the executive – who runs the machinery of the federal government, including the cogs and gears that carry guns – to simply say “No” to an out-of-control judiciary. This implied power of defiance is as much a check and balance as any enumerated one, and without it, you would have an unchecked judiciary with hundreds of district court judges presuming to micromanage the legitimate actions of the executive branch.\n\nYou know, kind of like what’s happening now.\n\nJudge Roberts’s problem is that he wants to return to something like regular order in the judiciary. What we have is highly irregular order. You non-lawyers need to understand that all these temporary restraining orders and injunctions and so forth are insane. This is not how law is done, either procedurally or substantively. I did litigation for 30 years, including in federal courts (up to arguing in front of the Ninth Circuit), and never saw anything remotely like these antics. So, realize that this is abnormal.\n\nAbnormal times call for abnormal responses, but that’s not how John Roberts or his ilk work. Remember, he’s a Bushie, the kind of soft Republican who sees his job less asfixing our broken government than managing its gentlemanly decline. We’ve largely booted them out of elective office, but Roberts has his seat for life. His advocation is protecting his institution. He wants the judiciary to be held in respect and obeyed, but he doesn’t want to do the hard, stern work of disciplining his underlings that makes that possible.\n\nJohn Roberts wants the normal appellate procedures to apply. He’s hoping that if he shuts his eyes and pretends that everything is normal, he’ll open them and it will all be normal again. This was the main takeaway from his unbelievably tone-deaf response to Trump’s, Musk’s, and others’ frustration-driven talk about impeachment. Now, Roberts was right in theory about what he said, but what we’re facing is not theory but practice. Putaside the practical reality that we’re not going to be able to impeach anybody, and don’t fall for the Internet amateur ambulance chasers who think there’s one neat trick where we can somehow get rid of judges by a majority vote because of “bad behavior.” That is a reason to get rid of them, not a means. The means is impeachment, and that takes 67 senators. That’s never going to happen so we should stop talking about it.They would wear a failed impeachment like Tim Walz would have worn his war medals if he had shown up to earn any.Haven’t we learned not to engage in failure theater?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn normal times, the response toa judge over one dumb decision is the appellate process. But these are not normal times. These are not one dumb decision. These are dozens of dumb decisions. And the answer here is not the appellate process because the appellate process is long, drawn out, and deliberate. The goal of this campaign is to use that delay to effectively strip Donald Trump of the ability to govern. To that end, they have sought towrap him up in aweb of orders and injunctions that will prevent him fromdoing the things he was elected to do. If it was one case or ten cases, you could wait months and months for the appellate process to grind through.Eventually,Trump administration will win most of these cases through the appellate process because they’re procedurally and substantively ridiculous. But the purpose of these judicial antics is not to fulfill the letter of the law, but to create friction that improperly prevents political actions that the executive has the right to take. In other words, Donald Trump may live in the White House, but he can’t actually be President, thereby disenfranchising the people who elected him.\n\nSo, we have a system that is not being used normally and that is not being used for a normal purpose. But Chief Justice Roberts, in his lack of wisdom, refuses to see that abnormal actions sometimes require abnormal responses. As I have said before, he will never be able to normal the abnormal back to normality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe thinks he can force normality back onto the judiciary by simply pretending the abnormality doesn’t exist and that everything is hunky-dory. He can’t. He must force normality back onthe judiciary by addressing the abnormality directly. That means he has to take abnormal actions in response. Procedurally, he needs to lead the charge to stop the imposition and use of these bizarre nationwide orders and injunctions by giving the circuit courts of appeal clear guidance to end this nonsense. Substantively, he needs to direct the circuit courts to issue stays on district court orders that far exceed the scope of the judiciary’s proper powers. And if the circuit courts of appeal refuse to do that, then the Supreme Court needs to issue the orders to enforce its will, even if that means issuing dozens and dozens of orders. The Supreme Court only takes 50 or socases a year. With over 100 lawsuits against the Trump administration as part of this lawfare campaign, that workload no longer works.\n\nWhat John Roberts is risking by refusing to put an end to these abuses is the Trump administration putting an end to these abuses by exercising its implied power under the Constitution to check an out-of-control judiciary. If an order issues and no one enforces it, is it really an order?\n\nJohn Roberts is running out of friends. The leftists hate him. They’ll tolerate him as long as he’s useful, but he’s not going to find any political support on the Democrat side when they come back into power. He’s got a little in the tank left on the right, but if he keeps this up, he’s going to be running on empty. Roberts still thinks that he can dip his toe into politics to protect his institution (see, e.g., his ridiculous, political Obamacare opinion), but he hasn’t thought through how he can do that without any friends to back him up when the executive pushes back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt some point, unless Robert puts a stop to this misconduct, Trump will simply refuse to obey. And when he does, he will ensure it is over some utterly outrageous order where he is acting both at the height of his Article II powers (like on some issue that involves command of the military or protecting America from foreign terrorists and gangsters) and at the height of his political power (like on some issue where he’s on the 80% side of an 80/20 split). He will resist from strength, while the judiciary fulminates impotently from weakness.\n\nLots of people are asking why Trump is not defying the courts now. It’s because he doesn’t have to. The Department of Justice under Pam Bondi is doing an incredible jobof litigating these cases – I’ve read a lot of briefs over the years, and the DOJ lawyers are writing terrific ones. The Administration is passively aggressively obeying these orders, being very picayune and literal in its interpretation of them, but it is not outright defying them. Nor should it. Outright defiance of a court order is another 80/20 issue, but 80% of normals right now believe the President should obey court orders. That will change if this keeps up and as Trump highlights the abuses, but right now, America is not politically ready for that fight, and Trump doesn’t need topull the trigger yet.\n\nYet.\n\nBut John Roberts better understands that if it comes to obeying the courts or neutering the executive branch and defying the will of the people, as expressed in the last election, the courts are going to lose. They don’t have any cops. They don’t have any Army divisions. All they have is their respect, and John Roberts’s underlings are busy squandering it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSadly, so far, John Roberts has shown no indication that he is wise enough to put a stop to this runaway train of out-of-control judicial election interference. He believes he’s acting to protect the judicial branch. He is not. His George Costanza-like gut instinct is always wrong. He would be better off interrogating his gut and then doing precisely the opposite.\n\nA decision point is coming. Decisive actionby the Chief Justicecould save the judicial branch byrestoring the judicial modesty that preserves the respect of the other branches. If only we could be confident that John Roberts was wise enough to do it.\n\nFollow Kurt on Twitter @KurtSchlichter.

        "full_text": "Walt Disney Studios’s new \"Snow White\" film is having a tough opening weekend.\n\nNot only is the film projected to have the lowest opening weekend among the studio’s live-action remakes so far, the movie is getting bombarded with bad reviews.\n\n\"The movie does earn points as a bedtime story, however, because it will definitely put you to sleep,\" Rolling Stone critic David Fear quipped in his review.\n\n'SNOW WHITE' REBOOT STAR, WHO KNOCKED 1937 FILM, IS 'THANKFUL' FOR CRITICS: 'MAKES ME FEEL LIKE TEFLON'\n\nThe film, a retread of the original 1937 animated classic, currently has a \"rotten\" 44% critics score from movie review aggregator site RottenTomatoes.com. Though audiences appear to have a more favorable view of the movie — the audience score sits at 74% — mainstream film critics have savaged the movie.\n\nThe New York Times’ chief film critic Manohla Dargis summed up her impressions of the film, saying it’s \"neither good enough to admire nor bad enough to joyfully skewer; its mediocrity is among its biggest bummers.\"\n\nKyle Smith at The Wall Street Journal wrote, \"Gloss prevails over heart in nearly every scene, and plot beats feel contrived,\" and The Boston Globe’s Odie Henderson lamented, \"I had high hopes that ‘Snow White’ would make me happy. Instead, this dopey remake made me sleepy and grumpy.\"\n\n\"Presumably one of the reasons to bring actors into remakes of animated classics would be to add a warm-blooded pulse to these characters. Zegler manages that, but everyone else in ‘Snow White’ - mortal or CGI - is as stiff as could be,\" The Associated Press said about the film.\n\nThe Guardian chief film critic Wendy Ide gave the film one star out of five and called it \"toe-curlingly terrible.\" She said that it’s \"A film made by people with cartoon dollar signs for eyes and not even the tiniest glimmer of art in their souls,\" and added that it’s \"a bamboo-splinters-under-the-fingernails viewing experience.\"\n\nPETER DINKLAGE CRITICIZES 'SNOW WHITE' REMAKE'S PUSH FOR DIVERSITY: 'IT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME'\n\nVanity Fair chief critic Richard Lawson wrote in his review on Friday, \"Hm? What’s that? This Snow White is not a made-for-TV movie shot in Burbank but is instead a theatrically released feature film that cost upwards of $250 million to make? Oh. Oh dear.\"\n\nHollywood outlet Deadline.com reported on Sunday that the film is projected to earn around $43 million this weekend, which puts it under Disney’s live-action remake of \"Dumbo.\" The 2019 film holds the title for the lowest box-office numbers of the live-action remakes of Disney's animated classics — earning $46 million.\n\nDisney’s \"Snow White\" remake could be said to be a bigger box-office bomb than \"Dumbo,\" as it cost $270 million to make, as opposed to the latter’s $170 million.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe film's controversy-filled production period may have contributed to its poor box office reception so far. In the three years leading up to \"Snow White's\" release, a year-long delay, Disney's apparent flip-flop on making the film's \"dwarfs\" depiction more politically correct, Zegler's bashing of the original film's traditional themes and her public demonization of Trump supporters, appeared to have soured the film before it even came out.",

        "full_text": "At this point, Disney’s live-action princesses should be able to sue for damages. Snow White, like The Little Mermaid before it, has thrust a promising new star into the centre of a lazily conceived, visually repellent remake, depending entirely on her talents to drive its machine. But it’s offered her nothing in return – not on screen nor support behind the scenes, considering our new Ariel and Snow White, Halle Bailey and Rachel Zegler respectively, are both women of colour targeted by rampant racist abuse online.\n\nZegler, like Bailey, was born for a role like this. She’s a classic theatre kid, bouncing off her first onscreen role as Maria in Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story to give us a wide-eyed, deeply earnest Snow. There’s a touch of Judy Garland in how she delivers the character’s new signature power ballad, “Waiting on a Wish”, with a beautifully clear voice and dreamy naivety.\n\nBut “Waiting on a Wish”, while the catchiest of the new tracks provided by The Greatest Showman’s Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, is also a perfect case study of Disney’s increasingly procedural attitude towards its live-action remakes. It’s a highly produced, machine-like approximation of a Disney song, created to fill the gap left by the 1937 original’s “I’m Wishing”, banished in fear of the implication that this princess is still waiting around for a man to give her purpose.\n\nOut, too, goes the majority of the narrative, replaced by a few buzzwords about bravery and being a father’s daughter. They never amount to anything beyond the lesson that good leaders always remember people’s names (sure, but are there not more inspiring lessons to be taught than basic etiquette?) Still in are the necessary nostalgic trademarks: the Evil Queen (Gal Gadot) and her magic mirror, the poisoned apple, and the seven dwarves.\n\nOf course, Disney is well aware of how troubling it is to characterise people with dwarfism as fairytale denizens. However, instead of using this as an opportunity to dismantle stereotypes through a reimagined narrative and platform seven actors with dwarfism in the process, the studio has summoned up the most corporate response possible. Human beings have been replaced with uncanny CGI caricatures that will make you yearn for the simple horrors of 2004’s The Polar Express. There are two actors with dwarfism in the cast – Martin Klebba voices Grumpy, while George Appleby plays an unrelated role – but neither are given the spotlight they deserve.\n\nDirector Marc Webb and cinematographer Mandy Walker struggle to impose any visual coherence between scenes shot on location and inside a studio. Characters will suddenly emerge from a colour-drained, flatly lit bit of woodland into a caramelised, abrasively artificial recreation of (supposedly) that same woodland. The Evil Queen is dripping in sequins and costume jewellery, which would suggest the anticipation of a camp performance, only to receive not a drop of that in return (Gadot’s involvement in organising screenings of an IDF-produced film about 7 October has led to calls from activists to boycott the film).\n\nThe film’s prince, played by Andrew Burnap and, for some reason, called Jonathan, is essentially Disney cannibalising itself, as he has the same thief backstory and curtain bangs as Tangled’s Flynn Rider. There’s self-cannibalisation at work, too, in Sandy Powell’s costumes, which are dour replicas of their animated counterparts. At times, Zegler’s bob leans dangerously close to “little Dutch boy”. What’s most disheartening about it all is how predictable Disney’s choices have become. With Snow White, they’ve finessed their formula – do the bare minimum to make a film, then simply slap a bunch of cutesy CGI animals all over it and hope no one notices.\n\nDir: Marc Webb. Starring: Rachel Zegler, Gal Gadot, Andrew Burnap, Ansu Kabia, Patrick Page. PG, 109 minutes.\n\n‘Snow White’ is in cinemas from 21 March",

In St John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Carney addressed the threat of US tariffs, repeating a favoured sporting analogy: \"In this trade war, just like in hockey, we will win.\"\n\nSpeaking in Ottawa earlier that day, Carney said he needed a clear, positive mandate to deal with Trump.\n\n\"We are facing the most significant crisis of our lifetimes because of President Trump's unjustified trade actions and his threats to our sovereignty,\" he said.\n\nIn a rally of his own in Toronto on Sunday evening, Poilievre said Carney's party was failing to offer change, and simply \"making the same promises that they've been breaking for over 10 years\".\n\nThe Liberals – once written off for this election - now have a chance of forming a government for the fourth consecutive time under Carney.\n\nCarney, 60, the former governor of the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada, has never served as an MP and is untested politically.\n\nCarney made the most of his short days in office, meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron and stopping in Canada's Arctic to announce a partnership with Australia to develop a new northern radar system.\n\nHe also ended Trudeau's signature carbon tax climate policy, which had faced heavy criticism by the Conservatives.\n\nNow he will face the general electorate, which is concerned about Canada's rapidly shifting relationship with the US, its historically close ally, as well as the country's high cost of living.\n\nIn a campaign launch shortly before the election call, Poilievre, 45, sought to link Carney to the Liberals under Trudeau, who left office as a deeply unpopular leader. He called Trudeau's time in office a \"lost Liberal decade\".\n\nHe accused the party of weakening the country by blocking resource development, failing to fund the military, and mismanaging immigration and the economy, saying its \"post-national globalist ideology\" made Canada more vulnerable to Trump's trade war.\n\nPresident Trump's current and threatened tariffs on Canadian goods could usher in economic instability in the country and push Canada towards a recession.\n\nTrump placed 25% tariffs on Canadian goods on 2 March before partially pausing them for a month. On 12 March, a blanket 25% duty on all aluminium and steel imports went into effect, hitting Canadian importers.\n\nThe Trump administration plans further global tariffs on 2 April, in the campaign's second week.\n\nCanada has retaliated so far with tariffs on about C$60bn ($42bn; £32bn) worth of US goods.\n\nCarney on Sunday called the trade war with the US one of the \"most significant threats of our lifetimes\".\n\nReferring to Trump, he said: \"He wants to break us so America will own us. We will not let that happen.\"\n\nCarney has promised further retaliation, though he has conceded there is a limit to Canada's tariff response given the different size of the two economies.\n\nPoilievre said that Canada must respond firmly to threats from the White House.\n\n\"We have to convert our anger and our anxiety into action,\" he said. \"We have to become strong, self-reliant and sovereign to stand up to the Americans.\"\n\nThe campaign will last just five weeks - the shortest allowed. Besides the US-Canada relationship, much of the focus will be on the economy, including cost-of-living issues.",

She was married to Donald Trump Jr. for 12 years. They had five children together.\n\nWoods announced March 11 that he ruptured his left Achilles tendon, knocking him out of the Masters and likely for the rest of the year.\n\nIt was not clear what prompted Woods, who keeps his personal life fiercely private, to publish photos confirming the relationship. It was reminiscent of 2013, when he and Lindsey Vonn both posted photos of them together to confirm they were dating.\n\nWoods said at the time he and Vonn “wanted to limit the ‘stalkarazzi’ and all those sleazy websites that are out there following us,” saying it could lead to dangerous situations involving his children. He also said their photos would devalue anything the paparazzi had.\n\nWoods has two children from his marriage to Elin Nordegren, who divorced him 2010 after he had been exposed for multiple extramarital affairs.\n\nHis only other public relationship was with Erica Herman, which lasted about seven years until he ended it in October 2022. It was a messy split, and Herman eventually dismissed lawsuits against Woods and the trust that owns his south Florida estate, where she had been living.\n\n___",

She was 49.\n\nHer family confirmed the death in a post on one of Ms. Love’s social media pages. She had been diagnosed in 2022 with a glioblastoma, an aggressive type of brain tumor.\n\nMs. Love’s parents immigrated to the United States from Haiti in the 1970s and settled in Brooklyn, where she was born. Her family later moved to Norwalk, Conn., where she attended high school. After graduating from the University of Hartford, she held a series of jobs, including flight attendant.\n\nShe eventually settled in Utah, where she joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Ms. Love began her political career fighting a mosquito problem in Saratoga Springs, Utah. She later became the city’s mayor.\n\nWhen she was elected to Congress in 2014, she made history as the first Black Republican woman to take on the role. She was viewed as a rising Republican star, and was the sole Republican member of the Congressional Black Caucus during her term, making her an uncommon symbol of bipartisanship in an era of deep division.\n\nShe frequently criticized President Trump’s positions, including on immigration, during his first term in office. She did not seek his endorsement during her re-election campaign in 2018 and lost her seat by less than a percentage point to Democratic challenger Ben McAdams.",

        "full_text": "(NewsNation) — As the battle over President Donald Trump’s executive order ending birthright citizenship heats up, the administration is cracking down on an underground industry in California where Chinese nationals pay money to baby brokers who get pregnant Chinese women into the country so their babies are born U.S. citizens.\n\nOfficials say these couples are often housed in luxury apartments or large mansions in the suburbs of Los Angeles, which neighbors call “baby farms.”\n\nIllegal Chinese birthing agencies organize the trips and charge upwards of $100,000.\n\nThe practice is nothing new, and crackdowns on these operations date back at least a decade.\n\nCalifornia hotels report seeing many Chinese pregnant women\n\nActing U.S. Attorney Joseph McNally says that this “system” birthed 30,000 Chinese babies into U.S. citizenship.\n\n“These were criminal enterprises that operated here in the United States and also people in China who would recruit,” he said. “The organizers here had contacts at hospitals and had contacts there. It was an industry. The organizers of these schemes were responsible for the birth tourism of thousands of babies. They had a system in place.”\n\nArea hotels and motels have reported seeing a number of Chinese pregnant women who would come and stay for months until giving birth.\n\n‘Rent a womb’ not illegal, but concerning: Attorney\n\nAnother popular option for more wealthy Chinese couples is the so-called “rent a womb,” where they pay American women to be surrogates. When Chinese babies are born from an American woman, they are automatically U.S. citizens but immediately return home to China.\n\nMcNally says it’s not illegal, but it’s a grave concern.\n\n“Anytime somebody has a U.S. passport, it means they have access to the United States,” he said.\n\nHe cited a case where a child born in Irvine in 2015 to a Chinese national went back and joined the Chinese military at age 20 but still had a U.S. passport.\n\n“That provides a real national security asset to China. And a real problem to the United States,” McNally said.\n\nClients pay around $200K to use US wombs at egg donor institute\n\nParham Zar, owner of the Egg Donor and Surrogacy Institute in Beverly Hills, said at one point, 90% of their clients were Chinese.\n\nBut he pushed back, saying the practice is not always ill-intentioned.\n\n“It is a misnomer in this field that people are just coming here to be a U.S. citizen,” he said. “I haven’t met anyone who had nefarious intentions of having a child. It takes a lot of time, effort and money to go through this process.”\n\nZar said clients pay about $200,000 for the surrogacy process to use American wombs.\n\nTrump signed executive order to end birthright citizenship\n\nIn January, President Trump signed a controversial executive order trying to end birthright citizenship.\n\nWhile it’s an uphill battle that requires changing the Constitution, it’s sparked a discussion that has exposed how birthright citizenship could be abused. Republican Congresswoman Harriet Hageman of Wyoming is sounding alarms.\n\n“Because of advances in technology, lax surrogacy laws, and the incorrect understanding of the 14th Amendment, countries are now using international surrogacy programs to rent wombs in America,” she said.\n\n“I found it to be incredibly strange and dystopian,” she added.\n\n“I just think we need to be having a national dialogue as to whether we think this is ethical, whether we think that this is appropriate. Whether we should be interpreting our own laws to be allowing the buying and selling of children essentially or the buying and selling of wombs.”",

        "full_text": "Three members of the punk band, the UK Subs – including Iggy Pop’s bass player Alvin Gibbs – were denied entry into the US.\n\nThe musicians are the latest foreign nationals to run into trouble with immigration at US airports since Donald Trump entered office.\n\nThe UK Subs, who have toured the US previously without incident, were due to perform at a punk festival in Los Angeles and flew into LAX.\n\nWriting on Facebook, Gibbs, 67, said: “After an 11-hour flight, my partner Roz and I arrived at the immigration booth. Roz was waved through without issue, but I was told that something had flagged up, necessitating further questioning.\n\n“There were two reasons given: first, they claimed I did not have the correct visa for entry; second, there was another unspecified issue that they refused to disclose.\n\n“I can’t help but wonder whether my frequent, and less than flattering, public comments regarding their president and his administration played a role — or perhaps I’m simply succumbing to paranoia.”\n\n“What followed was far from pleasant,” he added. The band members were taken to a holding pen.\n\n‘No sleep for well over a day’\n\n“My luggage, phone, and passport were confiscated. Hours later, at 4am (having landed at 7pm), I was called for a second interview,” he added.\n\n“By the time we were escorted onto the flight at 8pm the next day, I had gone without sleep for well over a day, surviving only on a pot noodle and a couple of cups of tea.\n\n“If that wasn’t enough, United Airlines policy dictated that I was not allowed a single alcoholic drink on the flight, given the circumstances of my deportation.”\n\nIn Los Angeles, band member Charlie Harper – who was allowed into the country – found three local musicians to fill in for the gig.\n\nA French academic claims they denied him entry into the US because of anti-Trump material on his mobile phone and a 28-year-old British backpacker was held for 19 days in a detention centre after authorities said her visa was improper.\n\nAnother incident has seen a 34-year-old German green card holder – who has lived legally in the US since he was a teenager detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after returning from a brief trip abroad.\n\n‘No right to privacy’\n\nIn recent days both the UK Foreign Office and the German foreign ministry have updated their advice to travellers visiting the US, now warning of the danger of detention if failing to comply with immigration rules.\n\nRosanna Berardi, an immigration lawyer, said there had been a change in approach to foreign visitors since Mr Trump took office.\n\n“They have the power to search, they have the power to seize, there are no rights to anything at a US border crossing, no right to a lawyer, no right to privacy,” she told The Telegraph.\n\n“That’s always been the case however what we’re seeing is the pendulum swing to a very, very aggressive position on these issues,” she added.\n\n“Now I would still argue that their behaviour is extremely aggressive, but they do have a lot of things in their computer system with respect to background checks and criminality and sometimes people show up at an airport or the border they don’t have the right paperwork.\n\n“With the musical bands that happens a lot, so I think there’s a host of things going on, but I think the message from this administration is, very loudly and very clearly, we are going to look at every person microscopic lately and the ease to which it used to be to enter the United States is in the rear-view mirror.”\n\n‘Increased scrutiny’\n\nChristi Hufford Jackson, an immigration lawyer with Laura Devine, told The Telegraph that there are typically valid reasons for border agents to intervene but there appears to have been a ratcheting up of their approach since Mr Trump returned to the White House.\n\n“They are clearly combing records to deny entry. There is increased scrutiny.\n\n“I think there are people being held in custody for simple transgressions, which is historically unusual.\n\n“There has been an escalation in how they are dealing with denials of entry.”\n\nJason Sullivan, a New Hampshire immigration lawyer, told The Telegraph: “During this time of increased enforcement of US immigration law, it is essential that immigration officials, including US Customs and Border Protection, remain committed to upholding due process.\n\n“Ensuring fair treatment, due process, and equal protection for all individuals is critical to preserving justice and the integrity of the immigration system.”\n\nThe Telegraph has approached Customs and Border Protection for comment.",

        "full_text": "Fierce protests in Turkey after Erdogan rival jailed\n\n11 hours ago\n\nEmily Wither & Maia Davies\n\nBBC News, in Istanbul and London\n\nTens of thousands of protesters have taken part in demonstrations across Turkey after the main rival to the country's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was formally arrested and charged with corruption.\n\nEkrem Imamoglu, the mayor of Istanbul, was due to be selected as the Republican People's Party's (CHP) 2028 presidential nominee in a vote on Sunday.\n\nIn response to his arrest, Sunday night saw a ramping up of the worst unrest the country has seen in more than a decade - with protesters fired upon with tear gas and rubber bullets.\n\nImamoglu said the allegations against him are politically motivated. \"I will never bow,\" he wrote on X before he was remanded in custody.\n\nErdogan has condemned the demonstrations and accused the CHP of trying to \"disturb the peace and polarise our people\".\n\nCrowds amassed near Istanbul's city hall by early evening on Sunday for a fifth night and could be seen waving Turkish flags and chanting in front of a row of riot police.\n\nOfficers were seen firing water cannons at some protesters and using pepper spray.\n\nImamoglu's wife Dilek Kaya Imamoglu addressed the large crowds outside the city hall, telling demonstrators that the \"injustice\" her husband has faced has \"struck a chord with every conscience\".\n\nThe demonstrations in response to Imamoglu's arrest are the largest the country has seen since the Gezi protests of 2013, which began in Istanbul over the demolition of a local park.\n\nIn total, rallies took place in at least 55 of Turkey's 81 provinces, or more than two-thirds of the country, according to a tally by French news agency AFP.\n\nImamoglu was one of more than 100 people, including other politicians, journalists and businessmen, detained as part of an investigation on Wednesday.\n\nHe was formally arrested on Sunday and charged with \"establishing and managing a criminal organisation, taking bribes, extortion, unlawfully recording personal data and rigging a tender\".\n\nHe was remanded in custody pending trial. AFP and local media reported he had been taken to a prison in Silivri.\n\nImamoglu has also been suspended from his post as mayor, Turkey's interior ministry said in a statement.\n\nIn social media posts, Imamoglu criticised his arrest as a \"black stain on our democracy\" and said judicial procedure was not being followed.\n\nHe urged people across the country to join protests and take part in Sunday's vote.\n\nIn a message shared on X through his lawyers late on Sunday, Imamoglu sent his greetings to those protesting and said that voters had showed Turkey had \"enough\" of Erdogan.\n\nImamoglu was the only person running in the CHP's presidential candidate selection.\n\nThe arrest does not prevent Imamoglu's candidacy and election as president, but if he is convicted of any of the charges against him, he will not be able to run.\n\nImamoglu's CHP party said nearly 15 million people cast a ballot on Sunday.\n\nThe CHP said some 1.6 million votes came from its members, while the rest were cast by non-members at separate ballot boxes for those who wished to show solidarity with Imamoglu.\n\nThe BBC cannot independently verify these figures.\n\nWaiting to cast her ballot, 38-year-old Aslihan told AFP: \"We won't give in to despair\".\n\nIn a post on X, Imamoglu's wife shared pictures of herself casting her vote and urged the country to vote for \"democracy, justice and the future\".\n\nThe jailed politician is seen as one of the most formidable rivals of Erdogan, who has held office in Turkey for 22 years as both prime minister and president.\n\nHowever, due to term limits, Erdogan cannot run for office again in 2028 unless he changes the constitution.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice has criticised those connecting Erdogan to the arrests, and insist on its judicial independence.\n\nOn Sunday, X's Global Government Affairs department said it objected to \"multiple court orders\" from Turkey's communications regulator to block over 700 accounts on the platform, including those of Turkish political figures and journalists.\n\nX said the move was \"not only unlawful, it hinders millions of Turkish users from news and political discourse in their country\".\n\nMeanwhile, Istanbul University announced on Tuesday it was revoking Imamoglu's degree due to alleged irregularities.\n\nIf upheld, this would put his ability to run as president into doubt, since the Turkish constitution says presidents must have completed higher education to hold office.\n\nImamoglu's lawyers said they would appeal the decision to revoke his degree to the Constitutional Court and the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nThe Supreme Election Council will decide whether Imamoglu is qualified to be a candidate.",

She was 43.\n\nPolice in Alexandria, Virginia, were called to a home on Beverly Drive in the suburb of Washington, D.C., at around 9:18 a.m. for the report of an unresponsive woman, according to a police statement. They found Aber dead inside.\n\nPolice said an investigation is underway surrounding the circumstances of her death.\n\nTwo sources close to the investigation told ABC News that the death appears to be from natural causes. At this point there is no indication of foul play, the sources added.\n\nA friend of the family told ABC News on Sunday that police believe the death was the result of a longstanding medical issue.\n\nHowever, officials are still awaiting a formal report as to the cause and manner of her death from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.\n\nAber, who served as U.S. attorney in Virginia for most of the Biden administration, took office in October 2021 after being unanimously confirmed by the Senate and stepped down in January, shortly after President Donald Trump's inauguration.\n\nAs U.S. attorney, Aber oversaw a staff of some 300 prosecutors and other staff and handled federal prosecutions in the state.\n\nShe started working in the office in 2009 as an assistant U.S. attorney, prosecuting financial fraud, public corruption, violent crime and child exploitation cases, according to an online biography.\n\nShe received her law degree from William and Mary Law School in 2006.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi shared a statement on X on Saturday night, writing: \"The loss of Jessica Aber, former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, is deeply tragic. Our hearts and prayers go out to her family and friends during this profoundly difficult time.\"\n\n\"We are heartbroken beyond words to learn of the passing of our friend and former colleague, U.S. Attorney Jessica Aber,\" current U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Erik Siebert said in a statement. \"She was unmatched as a leader, mentor, and prosecutor, and she is simply irreplaceable as a human being. We remain in awe of how much she accomplished in her all too brief time in this world.\"\n\nCalling her a \"proud Virginian from high school through college and throughout her career,\" Siebert's statement went on to say: \"Her professionalism, grace, and legal acumen set the standard. Though we are devastated by this loss, each of us in the Eastern District of Virginia (EDVA) will look to her example and endeavor to live up to that standard.\"\n\nIn a statement, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares said he was saddened to learn of her death, saying her \"career of public service included US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia and whose work with Ceasefire Virginia saved more lives than we may ever realize.\"\n\nHe added, \"Our thoughts and our prayers are with her family this week.\"\n\nABC News' Alexandra Faul contributed to this report.",

        "full_text": "President Donald Trump has rescinded an executive order targeting a prestigious international law firm after it promised to abandon diversity policies and provide $40m (£31m) worth of free legal work to support White House initiatives.\n\nPaul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP is a multinational law firm headquartered in New York that has many high-profile clients.\n\nTrump's 14 March order had terminated federal contracts with the firm and suspended security clearances for its lawyers, saying it was undermining the US judicial system.\n\nThe firm is now facing blowback from many in the legal community, including a top lawyer for Democrats, even as some lawyers said it had few other options.\n\nTrump has issued similar executive orders against the law firms Perkins Coie and Covington & Burling.\n\nThe White House rescinded the order on Thursday after a meeting between Trump and Brad Karp, the chairman of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Garrison & Wharton.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, the president said the firm had agreed to a series of concessions, including the promise to provide \"the equivalent of $40 million in pro bono legal services over the course of President Trump's term to support the Administration's initiatives\".\n\nIt added that Paul Weiss would commit to \"merit-based\" hiring and promotion, and \"will not adopt, use, or pursue any DEI policies\".\n\nTrump's order last week had cancelled contracts with the firms citing Trump's orders to wipe out any initiatives aimed at Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) within the federal government.\n\nThe Truth Social post also included a statement from Mr Karp, who said: \"We are gratified that the President has agreed to withdraw the Executive Order concerning Paul, Weiss. We look forward to an engaged and constructive relationship with the President and his Administration.\"\n\nMany in the legal community have expressed outrage over the deal, which one lawyer said was a \"sad day for the legal industry\".\n\nMarc Elias, a former Perkins Coie partner and a top lawyer for Democrats, assailed the agreement in a post on social media platform Bluesky.\n\n\"Paul Weiss, didn't just bend a knee, it set a new standard for shameful capitulation,\" he wrote. \"This is a stain on the firm, every one of its partners, and the entire legal profession.\"\n\nSoon after Trump made the announcement, Rachel Cohen, an associate at the Skadden Arps legal firm, resigned in a blistering company-wide email condemning the agreement.\n\n\"Please consider this email my two week notice, revocable if the firm comes up with a satisfactory response to the current moment,\" she wrote. Cohen had asked Skadden to sign onto a brief supporting another firm that has sued the Trump administration.\n\nShe had helped organise the open letter criticising the Trump administration for attempting to \"bully corporate law firms out of engaging in any representation that challenges the administration's aims\". More than 300 associates have signed the letter, using the name of their firm and class year, since it went live about a week ago, Politico reported.\n\nIn an internal email to its lawyers, Mr Karp defended the agreement, saying it was in line with the firm's principles, including a commitment to remaining politically independent, Reuters reported.\n\nThe firm brought in more than $2bn in annual revenues in 2023, and employed more than 1,000 attorneys, according to American Lawyer Magazine. Revoking its security clearance, which allows its lawyers to see some sensitive information, could have created hurdles to its work with its many corporate, security and Wall Street clients.\n\nIn the original executive order, Trump had accused the firm of playing \"an outsized role in undermining the judicial process and in the destruction of bedrock American principles\".\n\nIt had cited \"a Paul Weiss partner\" who had filed a pro bono lawsuit against the perpetrators of the 6 January 2021 riots at the Capitol. Trump has released all and pardoned many of those known as \"J6ers\".\n\nIt also took direct aim at Mark Pomerantz - a former partner who had worked with the Manhattan District Attorney on the case involving hush-money payments to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels. Trump was convicted by a jury last year of having committed a felony in the case.\n\nThe order had also alleged that the firm \"discriminates against its own employees on the basis of race and other categories prohibited by civil rights laws\".",

        "full_text": "George Foreman, heavyweight boxing icon and business entrepreneur, died on Friday night.\n\nHe was 76 years old.\n\nThe International Boxing Hall of Famer’s family announced the news on his Instagram page.\n\n“Our hearts are broken,” the caption read on the post. “With profound sorrow, we announce the passing of our beloved George Edward Foreman Sr. who peacefully departed on March 21, 2025 surrounded by loved ones. A devout preacher, a devoted husband, a loving father, and a proud grand and great grandfather, he lived a life marked by unwavering faith, humility, and purpose.”\n\nBorn in Marshall, Texas in 1949, Foreman, who admittedly was a bully in his youth, joined the Job Corps at 16 years old before turning to boxing at 17.\n\nHe made his first major stamp on the boxing world as a 19-year-old at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics when he won the heavyweight gold medal against Soviet fighter Jonas Čepulis.\n\nIn 2012, Foreman reminisced about the win and how “afraid” he was at the time of the fight after accumulating fewer than two dozen amateur fights before the Olympics.\n\n“When I look back at the fight, all I can remember was how afraid I was,” he told the BBC. “Chepulis was representing another ‘superpower’. I didn’t have the confidence that people thought I had.\n\n“I wanted to win gold but didn’t expect anything like that to happen in my life. But I was told to jab, jab, jab. With my jabs and other wild punches, there was no way to stop me. … The left jab was my number one punch — I still think it was the best punch in boxing.”\n\nOne year after his gold medal win, the fearsome and intimidating Foreman took up professional boxing, embarking on a legendary career that saw him accumulate a 76-5 record with 68 wins by knockout.\n\nIn 1973, he won his first of two heavyweight champions when he knocked out Joe Frazier — the heavyweight gold medalist in 1964 — during a bout in Jamaica.\n\nForeman lost the title one year later in the famous “Rumble in the Jungle” against Muhammad Ali in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo).\n\nIn 1977 after a defeat at the hands of Jimmy Young in a fight in Puerto Rico, Foreman suffered from exhaustion and heatstroke in what he called a near-death experience.\n\nHe stepped away from boxing for a decade and returned to Texas.\n\nHis life took a complete 180-degree turn as he became an ordained minister, and, in 1984, founded the George Foreman Youth and Community Center.\n\nForeman returned to the squared circle in 1987, and in 1994, found himself back on top in defeating Michael Moorer for his second heavyweight title at the age of 45 — two decades after losing his first to Ali.\n\n“Anything you desire, you can make happen,” Foreman said after that fight. “It’s like the song, ‘When you wish upon a star, your dreams come true.’ Well, look at me tonight.”\n\nIn 1997, he retired from boxing for good, having already reinvented himself as a gregarious pitchman endorsing various products, the most famous of which was the George Foreman Grill line, which earned him millions.\n\nForeman also made a number of television appearances in his life, including on a 1975 episode of “The Six Million Dollar Man” and, most recently, on “The Masked Singer” in 2022.\n\nHe had 12 children, and all five of his sons were named George.\n\n“I named all my sons George Edward Foreman so they would always have something in common. I say to them, ‘If one of us goes up, then we all go up together, and if one goes down, we all go down together,’ ” Foreman wrote on his website.\n\nWith his life spanning across sports and pop culture, stars from across the spectrum were saddened by the legend’s death.\n\n“Condolences to George Foreman’s family,” Mike Tyson wrote on X after the news of Foreman’s death broke. “His contribution to boxing and beyond will never be forgotten.”\n\n“Rest in peace, George Foreman. Your legacy lives on, champ,” NBA legend Scottie Pippen wrote.\n\n“Legendary boxing champion, life-changing preacher, husband, father, grand- and great-grandfather and the best friend you could have,” WBC President Mauricio Sulaiman wrote on his social media. “His memory is now eternal, may Big George rest in peace.”\n\n“Condolences to the family of George Foreman,” wrote actor William Shatner.\n\n“We are grateful for the outpouring of love and prayers, and kindly ask for privacy as we honor the extraordinary life of a man we were blessed to call our own,” Foreman’s family wrote in their statement.",

        "full_text": "George Foreman became the heavyweight champion of the world in his 20s, only to lose his belt to Muhammad Ali in perhaps the most memorable fight in boxing history.\n\nA full 20 years later in 1994, the 45-year-old Foreman became the oldest man to win the heavyweight championship, throwing one perfect combination to steal Michael Moorer’s title in an epic upset.\n\nFew fighters ever had more big moments than Big George Foreman — and even after he finally left the ring, he was only getting started.\n\nThe fearsome heavyweight, who lost the “Rumble in the Jungle” to Ali before his inspiring second act as a surprising champion and a successful businessman, died Friday night. Foreman was 76.\n\nForeman’s family announced his death on social media, not saying how or where he died.\n\n“A devout preacher, a devoted husband, a loving father and a proud grand- and great-grandfather, he lived a life marked by unwavering faith, humility and purpose,” his family wrote. “A humanitarian, an Olympian and two-time heavyweight champion of the world, he was deeply respected. A force for good, a man of discipline, conviction, and a protector of his legacy, fighting tirelessly to preserve his good name— for his family.”\n\nA native Texan, Foreman began his boxing career as an Olympic gold medalist who inspired fear and awe as he climbed to the peak of the heavyweight division by stopping Joe Frazier in 1973. His formidable aura evaporated only a year later when Ali pulled off one of the most audacious victories in boxing history in Zaire, baiting and taunting Foreman into losing his belt.\n\nForeman left the sport a few years later, but returned after a 10-year absence and a self-described religious awakening.\n\nThe middle-aged fighter then pulled off one of the most spectacular knockouts in boxing history, flooring Moorer — 19 years his junior — with a surgical right hand and claiming Moorer’s two heavyweight belts. Foreman’s 20 years is easily the longest gap between heavyweight title reigns.\n\n“His contribution to boxing and beyond will never be forgotten,” former heavyweight champion of the world, Mike Tyson, said on X, formerly Twitter, as he expressed his condolences.\n\nForeman’s transformation into an inspirational figure was complete, and he fought only four more times — finishing 76-5 with 68 knockouts — before moving onto his next career as a genial businessman, pitchman and occasional actor.\n\nOutside the ring, he was best known as the face of the George Foreman Grill, which launched in the same year as his victory over Moorer. The simple cooking machine sold more than 100 million units and made him much wealthier than his sport ever did.\n\n“George was a great friend to not only myself, but to my entire family,” Top Rank president Bob Arum said. “We’ve lost a family member and are absolutely devastated.”\n\nIn the first chapter of his boxing career, Foreman was nothing like the smiling grandfather who hawked his grills on television to great success.\n\nForeman dabbled in petty crime while growing up in Houston’s Fifth Ward, but changed his life through boxing. He made the U.S. Olympic team in 1968 and won gold in Mexico City as a teenager, stopping a 29-year-old opponent in a star-making performance.\n\nForeman rose to the pinnacle of the pro game over the next five years, but was also perceived as an aloof, unfriendly athlete, both through his demeanor and through the skewed racial lenses of the time.\n\nJim Lampley, the veteran boxing broadcaster who worked alongside Foreman for many years at HBO, told The Associated Press on Friday night that Foreman’s initial demeanor was an attempt by his camp to emulate Sonny Liston, the glowering heavyweight champ of the 1960s.\n\n“At some point somewhere along the way, he realized that wasn’t him,” Lampley said.\n\nForeman stopped Frazier in an upset in Jamaica in January 1973 to win the belt, with his knockout inspiring Howard Cosell’s iconic call: “Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!”\n\nForeman defended his belt against Ken Norton before accepting the fight with Ali in the now-immortal bout staged in Africa by promoter Don King. Ali put on a tactical masterclass against Foreman, showing off the “rope-a-dope” strategy that frustrated and infuriated the champion. Foreman was eventually knocked down for the first time in his career, and the fight was stopped in the eighth round.\n\nForeman told the BBC in 2014 that he took the fight almost out of charity to Ali, who he suspected to be broke.\n\n“I said I was going to go out there and kill him, and people said, ‘Please, don’t say you’re going to kill Muhammad,’” Foreman said. “So I said, ‘OK, I’ll just beat him down to the ground.’ That’s how easy I thought the fight would be.”\n\nExhausted and disillusioned, Foreman stopped fighting in 1977 and largely spent the next decade preaching and working with kids in Houston after his religious awakening. He returned to boxing in 1987 in his late 30s with a plan to defy time through frequent ring appearances, and he racked up a lengthy series of victories before losing to Evander Holyfield in a surprisingly competitive title fight in 1991.\n\nThree years later, Foreman got in the ring with Moorer in Las Vegas, more for his celebrity than for his perceived ability to beat Moorer. The champion appeared to win the first nine rounds rather comfortably, with Foreman unable to land his slower punches. But Foreman came alive in the 10th, hurting Moorer before slipping in the short right hand that sent Moorer to the canvas in earth-shaking fashion.\n\nLampley, who was calling the fight, named his upcoming autobiography — which includes a prologue about Foreman — after his famous call of that moment: “It Happened!”\n\nForeman quit the ring for good in 1997, although he occasionally discussed a comeback. He settled into a life as a boxing analyst for HBO and as a pitchman for the grills that grew his fame and fortune. Much of the world soon knew Foreman as both a lovable friend and a ferocious fighter.\n\n“He started performing as this pitchman, this product pitchman with the big, ever-present giant grin on his face,” Lampley recalled. “When I was working with him, people would say, ‘George is a big clown.’ And I would say, ‘Well, you can call him a clown, but he’s actually a genius. He may be the greatest genius I’ve ever met.’ And people would say, ‘Well, genius, what do you mean?’ I’d say, ‘Well, check the bank account. If that isn’t proof enough, I don’t know what is.’ So, he was a genius. He was a human genius.”\n\nForeman briefly starred in a sitcom called “George” in the 1990s, and he even appeared on the reality singing competition “The Masked Singer” in 2022. A biographical movie based on his life was released in 2023.\n\nForeman had 12 children, including five sons who are all famously named George Edward Foreman.\n\n“Legendary boxing champion, life-changing preacher, husband, father, grand- and great-grandfather and the best friend you could have,” WBC President Mauricio Sulaiman wrote on social media. “His memory is now eternal, may Big George rest in peace.”\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Brian Mahoney contributed to this report.\n\n___",

        "full_text": "It’s one of the most important debates taking place among Democrats after they lost the White House and the Senate last year. Their House majority was wiped away in the 2022 midterm elections. Democrats also suffered only their second national popular vote loss at the presidential level since 1988.\n\nTypically, the party out of power splits between forces that want to pivot back to the center, correcting mistakes that cost it the previous election, and those that think it is important to draw a stronger ideological contrast with their opponents.\n\nThe Democrats in 2025 are no different. Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) has made rhetorical overtures to Republicans and voted with them a handful of times. And Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) jeopardized his leadership position by defying the progressive base on a government shutdown. Both have faced backlash from those on the Left who want congressional Democrats to fight the GOP agenda at all costs.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris has been criticized for being too left-wing and cautious. Her past progressive positions, especially those taken in her failed 2020 presidential campaign, cost her votes in November. But she also soft-pedaled or reversed many of those stances, seeming like a flip-flopper and potentially depressing progressive enthusiasm for her candidacy.\n\nNewsom would surely like to be the Democratic standard-bearer in 2028. Since launching his podcast, he has interviewed MAGA figures such as Steve Bannon and Charlie Kirk. The California governor has also repudiated many progressive excesses, such as biological men competing as transgender women in female sports and the term “Latinx.”\n\nWalz might also be looking to strike out on his own after being Harris’s understudy in the 2024 campaign, especially if she doesn’t run again. The Minnesotan was sure to demonstrate he remained appropriately outraged by MAGA in all its forms.\n\nWhile Newsom said he wanted “to first understand what their motivations are” and figure “what they’re actually doing,” Walz had a simpler question for dealing with their shared political opponents: “How do we put some of those guys back under a rock?”\n\n“These are bad guys, though,” Walz said as Newsom explained why he had people such as Bannon and Kirk on his podcast. “These are bad guys.”\n\n“When you talk to a guy like Steve Bannon, he talks about working folks, and he talks about how we hollowed out the industrial core of this country,” Newsom said, later adding that what Bannon says “reminds me a lot of what Bernie Sanders was saying, reminds me a lot of what Democrats said 20, 30 years ago.”\n\n“But he denies the election!” Walz shot back, referring to 2020 instead of the more recent election he and other Democrats lost.\n\nNeither Newsom nor Walz is an ideal candidate for a Democratic rebranding. Both face major authenticity problems. Walz said of Trump supporters, “I do think I could kick most of their ass,” a characteristically awkward formulation. Newsom would have to explain constantly changing positions no less than Harris did and defend California’s dysfunction and liberalism.\n\nBut their conversation highlighted the Democrats’ choices in the next two elections. They can continue to run on democracy, Jan. 6, fighting Trump, and more or less reinforcing the progressive agenda. Or they can try to adjust, both in style and substance, so they are no longer on the wrong side of public opinion on as many matters.\n\nThe third option is to wait for Trump to self-destruct. It has happened before, and it is easy to see opportunities for it to happen again.\n\nSHINING ‘DAYLIGHT’ ON HOW DEMOCRATS BLEW THE 2024 ELECTION\n\nYet, after nearly a decade in national politics, Trump is still here. He is in the Oval Office while two leading lights of the Democratic Party are arguing about his aides on a podcast having failed to “kick most of their ass.”\n\nIt’s a conversation Democrats will be having a lot over the next couple of years.",

        "full_text": "The U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) reportedly issued a “threat advisory” on Thursday warning of “possible threats” from radical left-wing activists against the command’s Tesla owners.\n\nIn screenshots of the alert obtained by Federalist contributor and retired Army ranger John A. Lucas, the USASOC informed service members of increased “concerns” regarding recent attacks against individuals who own Teslas and dealerships that carry the vehicle.\n\nWithin the past few months, extreme left-wing anarchists have been waging a rhetorical and physical war against the electric car company to protest its founder Elon Musk’s role in identifying waste, fraud, and abuse throughout the federal government. These acts of left-wing “resistance” have ranged from harassing Tesla owners to outright vandalizing and destroying Tesla vehicles and dealerships.\n\nThe Trump Justice Department and FBI have pledged to crack down on what Attorney General Pam Bondi has referred to as incidents of “domestic terrorism.” Three individuals were indicted by the DOJ on Thursday for allegedly destroying Tesla properties.\n\nThe USASOC advisory noted that while there are currently “[n]o credible threats directed at USASOC personnel or assets … there is potential as this is an emerging threat.” The notice specifically highlighted a new website called “Dogequest,” which “has allegedly published personal details of Tesla owners across the United States, sparking concerns over privacy and security.”\n\n“Dogequest is an anonymous website that claims to ’empower creative expressions of protest’ by exposing Tesla owners’ personal data. According to 404 Media, the site includes a searchable database of Tesla drivers along with the locations of Tesla dealerships and charging stations,” the USASOC notice reads. “The site, which appears in the wake of anti-Elon Musk protests across the country, displays names, addresses, and phone numbers of Tesla owners on an interactive map and uses an image of a Molotov cocktail as its cursor.”\n\nEqually notable, however, is the USASOC alert about an allegedly upcoming “Tesla Takedown” day of action.\n\nThe warning noted that “[p]rotesters worldwide are preparing for their largest demonstration yet, 500 coordinated actions at Tesla showrooms on March 29 aimed at CEO Elon Musk’s controversial policies.” The notice cited remarks from Alice Hu, named as executive director of the left-wing Planet Over Profit, who purportedly disclosed that such demonstrations will take place at the more than 275 Tesla showrooms across America and “hundreds more abroad.”\n\nThe threat advisory concluded by encouraging USASOC members to “remain on high alert while in public areas, especially in presence of Tesla branded items” and “[c]ontact the proper authorities for threat-related events once you are in a safe location.” It also advised “Tesla branded items owners [to] properly secure their property to prevent unwanted damage to their property” and all personnel to remain in a “safe location” on March 29.\n\nShawn Fleetwood is a staff writer for The Federalist and a graduate of the University of Mary Washington.

        "full_text": "USDA did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThe collective cuts are expected to make it more difficult for food banks to meet families’ needs, with food prices now 20 percent higher than they were in 2020, food bank leaders say.\n\n“I certainly look at our lines and look at our shelves and say we need some relief,” said Joree Novotny, executive director of the Ohio Association of Foodbanks, which also reported canceled deliveries with no indication they would resume.\n\nFor the Central California Food Bank, that means a loss of 500,000 pounds of expected food deliveries worth $850,000 just for April through July, according to co-CEO Natalie Caples. Cathy Kanefsky, president of the Food Bank of Delaware, said between 20 to 24 full truckloads of food were canceled for the next four months.\n\nThe money that was clawed back across the three programs came from the Commodity Credit Corporation, a New Deal-era fund that gives USDA flexibility to prop up farmers facing natural disasters or adverse market conditions.\n\nIt’s not clear how much of the $500 million for the emergency assistance program has been cut, but one USDA employee, granted anonymity to discuss private conversations, said the Trump administration has been trying to claw back CCC money the Biden administration previously allocated in order to devote funds to other priorities.\n\nUSDA was supposed to spend $148 million of the $500 million early this year to buy dairy products, eggs, blueberries and more. But last month, the department notified state agencies that it was canceling solicitations from suppliers, according to a Feb. 20 email that Feeding America sent to its network of food banks and was viewed by POLITICO.\n\n“USDA has not yet announced plans to move forward with the canceled food orders,” the email states. “We believe the best approach is for network members to work through state agencies to obtain clarification from USDA.”\n\nFeeding America did not respond to a request for comment. Caples, the California food bank leader, said that she has not received any assurances from USDA on whether the delivery cancellations are temporary.\n\nChad Morrison, president of West Virginia’s Mountaineer Food Bank, said it is “really challenging” to meet the need in this state.\n\n“We can try to figure out how to make up the gaps, which is a hard lift, or ultimately there’s less food on the table,” Morrison said.\n\nThe emergency food assistance network gets its funding from a mix of money from the farm bill and through commodities USDA purchases. But the patchwork funding system has left the program unable to meet increasing hunger needs, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent years of food inflation, anti-hunger advocates say.\n\nThe Biden administration responded to the demand on food banks by supplementing the emergency assistance funding with roughly $2 billion from the CCC fund in 2022 and 2023, then the additional $500 million in 2024. But Republicans have argued that President Joe Biden used the CCC money for climate and nutrition initiatives that are outside the congressional mandate of the fund.\n\nMany of the organizations that rely on funding from the emergency assistance program were also receiving funding from the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement, one of the other food programs USDA axed recently.\n\nThe clawbacks come as Congress is weighing shrinking the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which helps 40 million low-income Americans afford food. That could further exacerbate the pressure on food banks, which provide just one meal for every nine that SNAP supplies.\n\n“We’re not intended to be a frontline grocery store and unfortunately we are that for more people than ever before,” said Novotny.",

        "full_text": "(Story has been updated to add more information.)\n\nThursday marked two months since President Donald Trump was sworn into office for his second term.\n\nWhile Trump's net approval ratings came out of the gates higher than in 2017, though still lower than those of any other president in modern history, recent polls show public sentiment more split, or in some cases more negative.\n\nBy late February, just one month into his term, his net approval rating − which is calculated as the difference between a president's approval and disapproval polling averages − had shrunk to nearly even.\n\nSince then, Trump has marched on with federal agency cuts and has continued to feature Elon Musk in a central role in his administration, both of which are controversial with voters, multiple polls have shown.\n\nMany modern presidents have seen their approval ratings gradually dip throughout their first year in office as they exit the so-called \"honeymoon period.\"\n\nHere is what polls tell us about how Americans approve of Trump's second presidency so far.\n\nHow Republicans' united front, Democrats' division play into Trump's approval ratings\n\nTwo months later, Trump's approval ratings did not show a major shift from the beginning of his term or compared with his first term, according to Costas Panagopoulos, head of political science at Northeastern University.\n\nBut he also said voters may continue to have reservations about the administration's priorities as the early policies unfold, especially as inflation continues and the stock market tries to recover from a tumble that started in February.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who dismissed other claims and comments that he made during the campaign because they expected that his priorities would be in line with things that they wanted,\" he told USA TODAY in an interview Thursday, mentioning the economy and inflation as examples. \"Now they're seeing well that might not be the case.\"\n\nBut crucial to understanding Trump's approval ratings, Panagopoulos says, is the Republican and Democratic parties, because Trump's approval ratings come from an already polarized electorate.\n\nWhile Democrats are fragmented, Republicans are putting forward a \"united front\" in supporting Trump, according to Panagopoulos.\n\n\"At least for now, that might be artificially inflating Trump's approval numbers overall, but specifically among Republicans,\" he said. \"People are not going to move away from Trump until they have an alternative they can move towards.\"\n\nWhat the Trump administration means for you: Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter.\n\nWhat presidential approval polls are saying\n\nNBC News:\n\nMore respondents disapprove of Trump's job than approve by a margin of 4 percentage points (poll conducted March 7-11; 1,000 registered voters; margin of error ±3.1 percentage points).\n\nThe poll found that more respondents today believe the executive and judicial branches have too much power than when asked about the same thing in 2019, according to NBC News.\n\nEconomist/YouGov:\n\nMore respondents have an unfavorable view of Trump than a favorable view, by a margin of 51% to 46% (poll conducted March 16-18; 1,618 U.S. adults; ±3.4 percentage points).\n\nDemocrats in Congress have become \"much less popular in the past few months,\" while Republicans in Congress have become more popular, according to YouGov.\n\nFifty percent of respondents to the poll somewhat or strongly oppose the recent layoffs of federal workers by the Department of Government Efficiency, compared to 38% who support the layoffs.\n\nMorning Consult:\n\nMorning Consult's measure of Trump's approval ratings has flipped net negative for the first time since he took office, with more respondents disapproving of his job performance (50%) than those who approve (48%). (Poll conducted March 14-16; 2,210 registered voters; margin of error ±2 percentage points.)\n\nTrump's approval rating with Morning Consult turned net negative a week later during Trump's first presidency.\n\n\"More voters than not still approve of Trump’s handling of most issues, with the president receiving his best marks on immigration (55% approval) and national security (52% approve),\" Morning Consult states.\n\nRMG Research/Napolitan News Service:\n\n54% of respondents either strongly approve or somewhat approve of Trump's job, compared with 44% who disapprove, strongly or somewhat (poll taken March 6-13; 3,000 registered voters; margin of error ±1.8 percentage points).\n\nKinsey Crowley is a trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

        "full_text": "Fulfillment of these lofty ambitions obliged America to support democracies and oppose dictatorships. As a global superpower with responsibilities no other nation was either able — or willing — to undertake, it could not afford to have the impeccably moral foreign policy of Sweden. Idealism inevitably clashed with realism, with the latter often triumphing over the former. This was especially true during the Cold War, when Washington helped engineer the overthrow of democratically elected leaders and supported authoritarian regimes. And it continues today with American backing of repressive governments in the Middle East. But even while employing immoral means, American leaders did so in the pursuit of what they considered moral ends, whether fighting communism, halting the spread of weapons of mass destruction, or resisting radical Islam.\n\nOpponents of the American-led liberal international order harp endlessly upon its faults while taking its virtues — free and open sea lanes, the spread of liberal democracy, values-based alliances, the protection of human rights — for granted. Eager to lambaste the order for its many faults, they prefer not to grapple with the international system rapidly taking its place, a dog-eats-dog world where America has abdicated its role as global policeman and authoritarian states gain spheres of influence in which less powerful countries must bend to their will. Even the most vociferous critics of American global power may come to miss it once Russia, China and Iran gain dominance over Europe, Asia and the Middle East.\n\nThe centurieslong record of at least rhetorical support for right over wrong is what made last month’s Oval Office meeting so unsettling. In a display that ought to shame every American, the country’s top two constitutional officers acted like a king and his regent, demanding obeisance from a feudal supplicant. Within days, Trump suspended military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, and while both were later restored, the message he sent was unmistakable: Not even an ally under military attack can depend upon Washington for support. Having abandoned Ukraine out of personal pique, Trump then returned to taking on the world’s other villains: Canada, Denmark and Panama.\n\nIn addition to abandoning our democratic allies abroad, Trump is gutting America’s democracy-promotion apparatus at home. During the Cold War, Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (the latter my former employer) broadcasted news and information beyond the Iron Curtain and continue this mission in regions of the world that remain unfree. (Many nations once subject to Soviet domination — including Poland, Czechia and the Baltic states — can credit VOA and RFE/RL, at least in part, for their freedom). The United States Agency for International Development was founded during the administration of Kennedy to alleviate the social and economic conditions in which authoritarianism and terrorism thrive. And the National Endowment for Democracy, created under Reagan, provides grants to democratic activists around the globe. Trump has halted funding for all of these organizations, which represent the best of American values, to cheers from Moscow, Beijing and Tehran.\n\nIn place of the idealism that animated American leadership of the Free World, Trump has unleashed the atavistic cynicism of the Old World. In this new dispensation where might makes right, any appeal to moral considerations in the practice of American foreign policy is ridiculed as a deficiency of the weak while the amoral exercise of power is venerated as a virtue of the strong. Instinctive American sympathy for the underdog is supplanted by admiration for the strongman. An embattled democracy is accused of provoking the invasion of its own territory — the geopolitical equivalent of blaming a rape victim for her own assault — and for the first time in history America votes with the world’s rogues against its traditional democratic allies at the United Nations. The occupant of the office once synonymous with “leader of the Free World” slanders the president of a country fighting for its very existence as a “dictator” while lauding a despotic war criminal as “a great guy” and a “terrific person.” At least when Franklin Roosevelt (allegedly) said that Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza “may be a son of a bitch, but he’s our son of a bitch,” he had the moral clarity to identify the caudillo for what he was, and the tact to do so behind closed doors.\n\nWhile Trump borrows from the Andrew Jackson school of American foreign policy, notable for its strident nationalism and distrust of international institutions, the historical figure whose ideas (and slogans) he leans most heavily on is Pat Buchanan. Once a marginal figure on the American right, the former Nixon speechwriter and Republican presidential candidate stood for the same “America First” trifecta — anti-immigration, anti-intervention and protectionism — as Trump does today. In the brave new world of America First, no longer does America stand for the belief that democracies make better allies than dictatorships, that territorial aggression should be punished rather than rewarded, and that alliances are an asset, not a burden. In his Munich speech, Vance endorsed the inclusion of far-right parties in European governments, which he accused of posing a greater threat to their own people than either Russia or China. All of this is the result of a foreign policy utterly lacking in moral scruples.\n\nThe abandonment of morality as a factor in foreign affairs also marks a turning point for the Republican Party. Next month marks the 50th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War. American conservatives once pointed to that event — the chaotic scenes of desperate Vietnamese fleeing the approaching communist onslaught, the 2 million boat people who managed to escape, the horrific repression that followed for those who did not — as a shameful example of what happens when the U.S. abandons an ally. Whatever the merits of American involvement in that conflict, the dire consequences of the American withdrawal reverberated across the region. Within months, Laos and Cambodia fell to communist insurgencies, vindicating the much derided “domino theory.”\n\nTrump’s abandonment of Ukraine has the potential to dwarf these events in geopolitical magnitude and human suffering. If Ukraine is made to sign a peace deal that doesn’t provide clear-cut security guarantees it will only be a matter of time before Russian President Vladimir Putin attempts another Anschluss. Absent American leadership of the Free World, such an incursion could succeed in toppling the Kyiv government, leading to tens of millions of refugees and a massive Russian military presence on the border of several NATO member states. With the alliance’s guarantee of collective security in tatters thanks to Trump’s extortionist threats not to uphold it, NATO — the most successful military alliance in history — will for all intents and purposes be dead, opening the door for further Russian predation in Europe and elsewhere.\n\nLooking for silver linings, some nostalgic for the recently departed era of American global leadership cling to the hope that everything will return to normal once a Democrat or traditional Republican moves into the Oval Office. While the fight over the future of conservative foreign policy is ongoing, there is no turning back. No longer confident of their place under the American security umbrella, alarmed allies like Poland and South Korea are exploring the possibility of acquiring nuclear weapons. The once-ridiculed French idea of “strategic autonomy” — a pole of European military power independent of the United States — is now the top agenda item across the continent. The “Five Eyes” intelligence-sharing alliance composed of the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand may shrink to “Four Eyes” due to the unreliability of its most powerful member.\n\nWhat transpired during the last two weeks of February cannot be undone in the minds of America’s allies or its adversaries. And in a world where every man is for himself, what’s the difference between the two?",

        "full_text": "Greenpeace backed radical protesters who tried to block a North Dakota pipeline. Now the pipeline company has won huge damages in a lawsuit against the iconic NGO. Other nonprofits should take notice.\n\nOn Wednesday, a jury in Mandan, North Dakota returned a stunning verdict against Greenpeace for its role in the violent protests and misleading PR campaign that disrupted construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline in 2016. The jury hearing the civil lawsuit found Greenpeace USA and two other Greenpeace entities liable for civil conspiracy, defamation, trespass, and other misdeeds. If the verdict stands, the storied environmental nonprofit will have to pay $667 million in damages to plaintiff Energy Transfer, the pipeline company that built and owns the DAPL.\n\nThe decision wasn’t entirely unexpected. In fact, Greenpeace had tried (and failed) to get the trial location changed, asserting that a jury in that oil-producing region would be biased in favor of the plaintiff. Nonetheless, the sheer size of the damages awarded will send shock waves through the loose networks of nonprofit groups that support disruptive protests around the nation.\n\nIn a City Journal article about the case, I noted similarities between the anti-pipeline protests near North Dakota’s Standing Rock Indian Reservation and other mass actions, including Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 and the anti-Israel demonstrations that erupted around the United States after the October 7 attacks. Making an analogy to hybrid warfare, I described these as “hybrid protests,” in which masses of peaceful demonstrators are joined by smaller groups of trained agitators who tip the events toward violence. As Park MacDougald has reported, these loose networks of troublemakers are often financially supported “by a vast web of progressive nonprofits, NGOs, foundations, and dark-money groups.”\n\nEnergy Transfer’s suit against Greenpeace represents the first major success in exposing and penalizing the putatively legitimate nonprofits that funnel money and material support to the lawbreakers embedding themselves in these hybrid protests. If the enormous verdict survives the inevitable appeals, it will be a major shot across the bows of progressive organizations that quietly foment political mayhem while maintaining plausible deniability.\n\nMany hybrid protests begin spontaneously as local people gather to demonstrate against a perceived injustice. But soon, outside activists—including trained Antifa-style agitators—begin flooding in. When police made arrests at various pro-Hamas campus uprisings, for example, they found that roughly half the arrestees had no connection to the schools they were occupying. These activists have the funds to travel long distances for extended periods and often arrive with specialized equipment for blocking roads, occupying structures, or fighting police. Some, like the lifelong activist Lisa Fithian, whom the New York Times observed leading the takeover of Columbia University’s Hamilton Hall, describe themselves as “trainers” teaching supposedly nonviolent tactics to neophyte protesters.\n\nEnergy Transfer’s civil lawsuit alleged that something similar took place at Standing Rock. Greenpeace maintains that the protest was led by local Native American activists and that the environmental group merely offered incidental support. The group is correct that the conflict began when the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe began protesting the pipeline being built close to its reservation. But, as a firsthand report in Outside detailed, before long outsiders—most of them white—began dominating the gathering. While local Sioux leaders struggled to keep the protests peaceful, many of the newcomers began blockading roads, torching heavy equipment, and battling with police.\n\nDuring the trial, Energy Transfer’s lawyers presented evidence that Greenpeace played a significant role in supporting the activists pushing for “direct action” against the pipeline. Greenpeace USA paid roughly $20,000 to send protest trainers—including a Greenpeace employee—to Standing Rock, court documents showed, while the group’s executive director personally raised another $90,000 for the effort. One internal Greenpeace email estimated the funding “has the potential to provide skills training to 3,000 activists.” Another Greenpeace employee bragged in an email about doing “some awesome spy shit” while scouting for potential blockade locations near the construction site.\n\nGreenpeace also supplied power tools, propane, tents, cold-weather gear, and a van equipped with solar panels. Energy Transfer’s lawyers particularly focused on the 20 to 30 “lockboxes” Greenpeace delivered to the Standing Rock occupation. A lockbox—sometimes known as a “sleeping dragon”—is a sophisticated device that allows activists to chain themselves to heavy equipment or to each other while forming human blockades. They consist of heavy PVC or concrete tubes into which activists can lock their arms, making it impossible for police to separate or move them without special equipment. The lockboxes proved a major headache for law enforcement officers trying to remove protesters from highways and construction sites. One photo displayed at the trial showed a Greenpeace-paid trainer using a lockbox. When then-Greenpeace executive director Annie Leonard received a text showing another demonstrator employing the device, she responded approvingly that the action “ups the ante.” Asked to explain that phrase in court, Leonard compared the protester with anti-segregation activist Rosa Parks.\n\nThe North Dakota jury also supported Energy Transfer’s claims that Greenpeace defamed the company in its public statements about the project and illegally interfered with the company’s relationship with financial institutions. Greenpeace maintains that its actions supporting protesters and its claims regarding Energy Transfer all fall under the First Amendment. “We should all be concerned about the future of the First Amendment, and lawsuits like this aimed at destroying our rights to peaceful protest and free speech,” Deepa Padmanabha, senior legal counsel for Greenpeace USA, told the Washington Post. The jury concluded, however, that trespassing and vandalism don’t constitute peaceful protest, and defamation is not free speech.\n\nAsked for comment on the verdict, a spokesperson sent me this statement from Greenpeace USA executive director Sushma Raman: “This is the end of a chapter, but not the end of our fight. Energy Transfer knows we don’t have $660 million. They want our silence, not our money.”\n\nEnergy Transfer no doubt faces a long road before it can collect any money from Greenpeace. The NGO has already announced that it will appeal the verdict, and one of the group’s international affiliates has filed suit against the pipeline company in the Netherlands under an EU free-speech law. But Energy Transfer’s stunning court victory will have an impact that far outweighs any financial gains.\n\nOver the decades, progressive NGOs have grown increasingly bold about funding radical organizations that support violent actions. Many of these seemingly mainstream groups rely on liberal donors who are unaware of just where their money is going. They rely on a veneer of respectability—and opaque funding channels—to shield them from lawsuits or prosecution. But for nonprofits that conduct or fund genuinely illegal behavior, the era of the untouchable NGO may be coming to an end.",

The records show that GEC extensively communicated with an assortment of USAID branches, including \"TF 2020-COVID 19,\" \"Digital Development,\" Asia Bureau ES Taskers,\" \"Asia Outreach,\" \"Conflict Prevention and Stabilization (CPS) Policy,\" and \"CPS Africa.\"\n\nAccording to America First Legal's findings, the GEC also collaborated with private-sector internet censors, such as Poynter and NewsGuard, to use AI censorship tools for monitoring \"misinformation.\"\n\nTwo days after the 2020 presidential election, Matt Skibinski, general manager of NewsGuard Technologies, started an email chain pitching NewsGuard's services. Included in this email chain were government employees with the U.S. State Department, the National Security Agency (NSA), and U.S. Defense Department components, including the National Security Innovation Network (NSIN), U.S. Cyber Command, and the U.S. Army European Command.\n\nThe principal email recipient was ex-Obama State Department official Christina Nemr, the director of Park Advisors at the time. Park Advisors, according to Nemr's LinkedIn page, \"Designed and led multi-million public-private initiatives addressing security threats in the information environment, bridging gaps between emerging technologies and real-world operational needs.\" In this role, Nemr said she also \"support[ed] government adoption.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year, the U.S. House Small Business Committee found that Park Advisors received a GEC cooperative agreement award of more than $6 million. Park Advisors then distributed subawards to several companies, including NewsGuard, the Atlantic Council, and the Global Disinformation Index, a Soros-funded project that reportedly generated a blacklist of conservative websites that advertising companies should boycott.\n\nTogether, these groups, which are not subject to the same international restrictions that GEC was, tested disinformation products, leading to the creation of the \"Disinfo Cloud,\" an unclassified platform used by the U.S. government and other world powers \"to counter adversarial propaganda and disinformation.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSkibinski provided samples of the new GEC/U.S Cybercommand Testbed Pilot (a.k.a. \"Misinformation Fingerprints\"), a program utilizing artificial intelligence and machine learning to monitor \"misinformation,\" flag examples, and rank sites accordingly.\n\nResearch from the Foundation For Freedom Online revealed how NewsGuard operates the enforcement arm of the censorship industry and rates websites based on how much perceived \"misinformation\" each page publishes.\n\nFurthermore, on February 4, 2021, Vonda Wolcott, senior program manager at the Institute for War and Peace Reporting, connected GEC's Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) \"expert\" with Baybars Orsek from Poynter, which, according to America First Legal, funds a global false-flag operation of international \"fact-checkers.\" Though they claim to be independent, this army of content moderators pledge fealty to a tightly woven network bankrolled by Poynter and the GEC.\n\nOne of the released emails illustrates how closely GEC and Poynter worked in tandem, with GEC's \"expert\" offering to \"walk [Poynter] through GEC's new M&E workbook.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the investigative work of America First Legal, the GEC also collaborated with foreign officials in the British Foreign, Commonwealth, & Development Office on \"disinformation\" efforts.\n\nThe now-defunct GEC, which was established by then-President Barack Obama via executive order, \"counter[ed] foreign disinformation\" before it was forced to shut down in December 2024 following a number of First Amendment lawsuits. Through several Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, America First Legal previously uncovered that the GEC engaged in state-sponsored propaganda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The partnership between USAID and the Global Engagement Center is bad news for the American people. Add in the fact that they were coordinating with internet censorship enforcers at NewsGuard and Poynter, and you can start to see just how dangerous this unholy alliance is for free speech and free expression,\" America First Legal senior counsel Andrew Block said in a statement. \"Thankfully, the GEC is shuttered and USAID is being exposed — but lawmakers should take note of this example as they consider legislation to ensure the federal government actually serves American principles and interests.\"\n\nTownhall knows all too well what it’s like to be the target of internet censors like NewsGuard. They’ve tried to silence us, to bully us into only covering the “approved narrative.” But thanks to the support of our VIP members, we get to keep sharing the facts and stories that matter most to our you.",

        "full_text": "President Trump continued his push to unwind the U.S. Department of Education on Friday, announcing that the management of the entire federal student loan portfolio and of the department's \"special needs\" programs would be moved to other federal agencies immediately.\n\nAppearing in the Oval Office with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Trump said, \"I've decided that the SBA, the Small Business Administration, headed by Kelly Loeffler, a terrific person, will handle all of the student loan portfolio. We have a portfolio that's very large,\" Trump said.\n\nThe federal student loan portfolio — which includes about $1.6 trillion in loans for roughly 43 million borrowers — is currently overseen by the Education Department's office of Federal Student Aid (FSA). That office has been gutted by the recent raft of buyouts, early retirements and last week's broad reduction-in-force.\n\nIt was not clear, based on Trump's announcement, how or if the remaining employees and expertise at FSA would be transferred to the Small Business Administration.\n\nTrump said he would move student loans \"out of the Department of Education immediately\" and that Loeffler and her staff are \"all set for it. They're waiting for it. It'll be serviced much better than it has in the past. It's been a mess.\"\n\nSome 8 million federal student loan borrowers are currently in legal limbo, not making loan payments, because their Biden-era repayment plan was frozen by a judge for being potentially illegal. Borrowers also can't currently enroll in any of the federal government's income-driven repayment plans, though that is expected to change soon.\n\nIn a statement, Loeffler said, \"As the government's largest guarantor of business loans, the SBA stands ready to deploy its resources and expertise on behalf of America's taxpayers and students.\"\n\nBut those resources are about to take a big hit as well, as the SBA also announced on Friday that it plans to cut its workforce by more than 40%.\n\nMultiple sources at FSA who could not speak publicly for fear of retribution said they were blindsided by the news.\n\nLogistical challenges aside, the role of the office of Federal Student Aid as the administrator of the student loan portfolio is protected by law. It's not clear how these responsibilities could be legally moved without a vote of Congress.\n\nIn a statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt acknowledged, \"The President has always said Congress has a role to play in this effort, and we expect them to help the President deliver.\"\n\nAs recently as Thursday, Leavitt had assured reporters that, \"when it comes to student loans and Pell Grants, those will still be run out of the Department of Education.\"\n\nChanges to oversight of 'special needs' remain unclear\n\nAfter announcing these potential changes to the federal student loan portfolio, Trump then said, \"Bobby Kennedy, the Health and Human Services [secretary], will be handling special needs,\" referring to cabinet member Robert F. Kennedy.\n\nThis appears to be a reference to the federal law known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which the Education Department administers. The law guarantees students with disabilities the right to a free, appropriate education and, in 2024, sent roughly $15 billion to schools to help pay for special education services. The law also makes clear that it is the secretary of education's responsibility to administer these funds.\n\nIn a post on Bluesky, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., called the potential changes \"a clear violation of education & appropriations law.\"\n\nThe Education Department has a dedicated Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, and, as with the federal student loan portfolio, it's unclear how these collective responsibilities on behalf of children with disabilities could be moved legally without a vote of Congress.\n\nIn a post on X, Health and Human Services Secretary Kennedy said his agency \"is fully prepared to take on the responsibility of supporting individuals with special needs.\"\n\nNot everyone was convinced.\n\n\"This is not a minor bureaucratic reorganization — it is a fundamental redefinition of how our country treats children with disabilities,\" said Keri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union, which represents more than 1,800 parent organizations across the country.",

President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin talked Tuesday on the phone for a few hours, and Zelensky and Trump talked Wednesday.\n\nSince the president’s return to office in January, the Trump administration has set out on a mission to end the Russia-Ukraine war, which passed its three-year mark last month.\n\n“We have never been closer to peace with these two parties,” Bruce said.",

        "full_text": "WASHINGTON — Trump adviser Elon Musk visited the Pentagon on Friday for a briefing that President Donald Trump insists was focused on the tech mogul's Department of Government Efficiency efforts, disputing a New York Times report that the meeting would include a discussion of plans for any potential war with China.\n\n\"He's there for DOGE, not there for China, and if you ever mentioned China, I think he'd walk out of the room,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office later in the morning when asked about Musk's meeting.\n\nThe Times was first to report Musk's Pentagon briefing. Citing two U.S. officials, the news outlet also reported that the meeting would focus on what the military might do if any war were to break out with China. Trump and his defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, repeatedly denied the report.\n\n“We welcomed him today to the Pentagon to talk about DOGE, to talk about efficiencies, to talk about innovations,\" Hegseth told reporters at the Oval Office after he and Trump had announced the production of a next-generation fighter jet. \"It was a great, informal conversation. The rest of that reporting was fake. There was no war plans, there was no Chinese war plans. There was no secret plans.\"\n\nHegseth, who had met with Musk in the morning at the Pentagon, did not say whether the discussion completely excluded talk about China more generally.\n\nMusk arrived at the Pentagon at a little before 9 a.m. ET and his visit lasted a little over an hour. When asked afterward how the meeting went, he told reporters as he was walking with Hegseth, “It’s always a great meeting.”\n\n“I’ve been here before, you know,\" Musk added as the two men joined in a laugh.\n\nThree defense officials had confirmed to NBC News earlier Friday that Musk had been scheduled to have a briefing at the Pentagon, and one of the topics would be China. But the officials could not confirm that the meeting would focus specifically on plans for any potential war, known as the operational plan, or O plan. Two of the officials also said the briefing would be unclassified.\n\nThe decision to brief Musk on military plans for China would mark a notable evolution of his involvement in the Trump administration and, potentially, his access to U.S. secrets. Musk, whom the president has charged with overseeing a government cost-cutting initiative known as the Department of Government Efficiency, could also have conflicts of interest, as Musk’s own products and businesses are used by the federal government, including Starlink and SpaceX, which contracts with the Defense Department.\n\nMusk also has deep financial interests in China — his electric vehicle maker Tesla has two facilities in Shanghai, and China is the company's second-largest market.\n\nLate Thursday night, Trump denied the Times' article, saying in a post to his Truth Social platform that the news outlet had reported \"incorrectly, that Elon Musk is going to the Pentagon tomorrow to be briefed on any potential 'war with China.' How ridiculous? China will not even be mentioned or discussed. How disgraceful it is that the discredited media can make up such lies. Anyway, the story is completely untrue!!!”\n\nAsked for comment about Musk's visit to the Pentagon, the White House referred to the president's Truth Social post.\n\nHegseth also denied the Times report, saying in a post on X \"this is NOT a meeting about 'top secret China war plans.' It's an informal meeting about innovation, efficiencies & smarter production.”\n\nPentagon spokesman Sean Parnell called the Times’ reporting “100% Fake News” in a post on X. “Just brazenly & maliciously wrong. Elon Musk is a patriot. We are proud to have him at the Pentagon.”\n\nAsked Friday in the Oval Office why he wouldn't want to show potential plans for a war with China to Musk, Trump said, \"I don’t want to show that to anybody, but certainly you wouldn’t show it to a businessman who is helping us so much. He’s a great patriot,\" referring to Musk's spearheading of the administration's efforts to slash the size of government.\n\n\"He’s finding tremendous waste, fraud and abuse,\" Trump said. \"But I certainly wouldn’t want, you know Elon has businesses in China, and he would be susceptible, perhaps, to that, but it was such a fake story.”",

She did not provide further details.\n\nIt was unclear when or how the scientist might have worked at or interacted with the laboratory at Los Alamos, N.M.\n\nLos Alamos National Laboratory is best known as a place that was crucial to the development of the atomic bomb.\n\nToday, it is a top research facility for the National Nuclear Security Administration, but it also conducts scientific work on other topics. Jennifer Talhelm, a spokesperson for the laboratory, said it was “working with federal officials to understand more about the incident” involving the scientist.\n\nThe scientist was working for France’s publicly funded National Center for Scientific Research. Representatives for the center said that he did not wish to speak to the media, but they did not immediately respond to the Department of Homeland Security’s allegations against him.\n\nNeither did the office of Mr. Baptiste, who used to lead the French National Center for Space Studies before he became minister in 2024.\n\nBut on Friday, Mr. Baptiste repeated his claim that the scientist had been targeted because of private discussions and opinions about the Trump administration’s policies.\n\nHe told Sud Radio in an interview that he had not spoken with the scientist directly but that his ministry was in touch with him.\n\n“Each country is free to regulate their borders,” Mr. Baptiste acknowledged. But he said the scientist’s case was “extraordinarily atypical” and a “subject of concern.”\n\nThat concern was shared by the French Academy of Sciences, which said in a statement on Thursday that the scientist’s deportation “seriously undermines the fundamental freedoms of the academic world: freedom of thought, expression and travel.”\n\nZolan Kanno-Youngs contributed reporting from Washington, D.C., and Ségolène Le Stradic from Paris.",

        "full_text": "The head of the federal task force to combat antisemitism dismissed “rumors” Thursday that Columbia University was nearing a deal to restore $400 million in federal funds frozen by the Trump administration, arguing that the Ivy League school was “not even close” to meeting President Trump’s demands.\n\n“There was a rumor out there that there was a settlement approaching to restore Columbia’s $400 billion that we froze. Let me be very clear to your listeners and to the nation and to the Jewish American community. That’s not true,” task force chief Leo Terrell told John Catsimatidis and Rita Cosby during an appearance on “Cats & Cosby.”\n\nLocal outlet WABC-TV and the Wall Street Journal have both reported that Columbia University was nearing a deal to meet nine preconditions set forth by the Trump administration that would allow it to consider restoring funding amounting to roughly 8% of the institution’s US-taxpayer funding.\n\nThe administration demands for “formal negotiations” regarding the elite school’s “continued financial relationship with the United States government” to move forward include the school punishing those responsible for the violent takeover of Hamilton Hall in April 2024, moving the disciplinary process to the office of the president, implementing an on-campus mask ban, formalizing an antisemitism definition and placing the school’s Middle East, South Asian and African Studies departments under “academic receivership” for at least five years, which would give someone outside of the departments the power to make decisions for the faculty.\n\n“President Trump and [Attorney General] Pam Bondi have made it a commitment that this task force – we’re going to eradicate antisemitism at all of these schools, and I will submit to you, Rita, that’s not happening at this point at Columbia University,” Terrell said.\n\n“I will tell you right now that Columbia has not, in my opinion, and the opinion of the Department of Justice, has not cleaned up their act regarding anti-Semitism,” he added. “I’m also telling you that there is no agreement – they’re not even close, not even close to having those funds unfrozen.”\n\n“Jewish American students don’t feel comfortable going to that school,” Terrell said of Columbia.\n\nColumbia University faced a Thursday deadline to agree to the preconditions, but the Trump administration has extended the deadline until the end of Friday, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe university declined to comment on Terrell’s remarks or the status of negotiations.\n\nThe antisemitism task force head further revealed that he will soon be going on a tour of 10 universities to warn them “If you want federal funding, if you want to make sure that you are going to avoid lawsuits under Title VI, Title VII, if you want to make sure your tax status is correct, you have to allow Jewish American students to go to school without being harassed or tormented.”\n\n“Not one of those universities on my list has met that standard,” Terrell said.",

        "full_text": "​Patrick Healy, the deputy Opinion editor, hosted an online conversation with four Times Opinion columnists about the Trump administration’s popularity among Republicans and why so many in the party believe the country is heading in the right direction.\n\nPatrick Healy: David, Bret, David, Ross: Donald Trump is the only president in our lifetimes who’s had a net-negative job approval rating in his first 100 days in office. Trump also has the largest gap in approval ratings in 80 years — 90 percent of Republicans like his performance, while only 4 percent of Democrats do. Those Trump supporters are really on board with him; more registered voters think America is on the right track than at any point since 2004, according to a new NBC News poll. To be clear, a majority still say America’s on the wrong track, and Trump’s polling on the economy is sagging. But I want to dig into why more voters feel better about America’s direction now than compared with under Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Trump 1.0.\n\nAnd I wanted to do so through the eyes of my more conservative colleagues. The four of you span the ideological spectrum on the right, and you’ve all written extensively about Trump. Why do so many Republicans like the direction Trump is taking the country in? Is it about his style, or his policies, or the mind-set and mood of the G.O.P., or something else?\n\nDavid Brooks: I’d start with the world we’ve been living in for the last decade or so. According to an Ipsos survey last year, 59 percent of Americans think our country is in decline. Sixty percent believe “the system is broken.” Sixty-nine percent believe the “political and economic elite don’t care about hard-working people.” If those are your priors, then you’re going to be happy with a president who wields a wrecking ball.\n\nHealy: As Trump liked to say while campaigning, “What the hell do you have to lose?”\n\nBrooks: I’d add another phrase: “brokenism.” This is the belief system popularized by Alana Newhouse in Tablet magazine in 2022. It’s the idea that everything is broken and we just need to burn it all down. Personally, I think some things are broken and some things are OK, but most of my Trump-supporting friends are brokenists. They get this from media consumption. Do you remember that 2013 study that people who consumed a lot of media about the Boston Marathon bombing experienced “higher acute stress” than those who were actually at the bombing? There’s something about screens that contributes to a catastrophizing mind-set.\n\nDavid French: In addition to the brokenism that David talks about, there’s a strong undercurrent of raw animosity in our politics. Republicans and Democrats have very negative views of each other, and many Republicans (sadly!) want their opponents to suffer. They’re actually happy to see people lose their jobs or to see nonprofits lose funding if those people are perceived as part of the “deep state” or RINOs.\n\nSo, yes, Republicans want a disruptive president, but who’s being disrupted really matters — and if it’s the government or institutions that many Republicans believe are hostile to them, then Republicans are just fine with the pain. Many Republicans dislike foreign aid. Or loathe elite universities. Or hate big liberal law firms. Students and professors at elite universities have a long track record of targeting the free speech rights of their conservative colleagues, and Republicans are rationalizing their own constitutional violations as fighting fire with fire.\n\nHealy: That element of gleeful animosity comes through on Trump’s social media posts, David — like a “Take that!” smack, sticking it to universities or shutting down D.E.I. One of Trump’s most effective rallying cries in the last campaign was “I am your retribution.”\n\nRoss Douthat: I think there are all kinds of ways in which Trump’s popularity is connected to distinctive shifts in the culture in the last 15 years — the trends on both left and right that have boosted populists all over the Western world. But it’s also important to stress that part of what Republicans like about Donald Trump is just that Donald Trump is a Republican.\n\nHis biggest policy accomplishment so far is shutting down illegal immigration — something Republican voters strongly support. His signature legislative goal is extending his first-term tax cuts — a classic Republican policy goal. He wants to fire federal bureaucrats, downsize and devolve the Department of Education, cut regulations — this isn’t some populist rebuke of Ronald Reagan’s conservatism, this IS Ronald Reagan’s conservatism! So is picking fights with liberal judges and liberal universities. And if you told someone in, say, 2004 that a Republican president was stretching the boundaries of civil liberties to deport noncitizens accused of sympathizing with Hamas and Hezbollah, absolutely nobody would regard his popularity with G.O.P. voters as a puzzle in need of explanation.\n\nThere are important ways in which Trump’s style and tactics and some of his policy goals — the trade and tariff agenda, above all; foreign policy to some degree — are not old-school Republican politics as usual. But we shouldn’t exaggerate the break or make a deep mystery of why Republican voters would react favorably to much of what he’s doing.\n\nBret Stephens: Patrick, Alexander Hamilton supplied one part of the answer in Federalist No. 70: “Energy in the executive is a leading character in the definition of good government.” So leave to one side questions about what Trump is doing. What most Americans notice is that Trump is doing: bombing the Houthis, tariffing our neighbors, strong-arming President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, threatening Hamas, abolishing U.S.A.I.D. He’s the guy supporters and opponents alike struggle to keep pace with — while he grips their attention.\n\nA second part — and this is especially important for Trump critics like me to acknowledge — is that at least some of what he’s doing is succeeding. It is important that we finally have regained control over the southern border — proving, if nothing else, that we aren’t helpless in the face of these vast migratory flows. Getting rid of D.E.I. programs that had become a pervasive system of racial gerrymanders is, by my lights, another achievement. Demanding that Columbia University ban face-covering masks and enforce meaningful discipline on menacing and disruptive pro-Palestinian protesters in exchange for continued government funding strikes me as a good conclusion. And I really don’t think the nation will miss the Department of Education when it’s gone.\n\nBrooks: Bret, you now live in a country in which “tariffing” is a verb. I feel like this signifies the end of Western civilization. It started when consultants began using “learnings” as a noun. The path to perdition is slow, but accelerating.\n\nStephens: It’s a legit verb, David. For realz.\n\nFrench: I’m glad Bret brought up the border and the Houthis. These were two areas where the Biden administration failed (without good excuse), and the ease with which Trump pivoted to a different and better course highlights that many Democrats still don’t quite understand how poorly the Biden administration performed in its approach to both crises.\n\nHealy: And you’re seeing in poll numbers now that the Democratic Party is at a nadir in popularity. It boils down to trust, ideas and leadership.\n\nBrooks: I’d offer up one more word for consideration: “exclusion.” Progressives really have spent the last few decades excluding conservative and working-class voices from a lot of institutions. Trump has gone after these institutions big time — the universities, the Department of Education, the State Department. Of course, the MAGA crowd feels justified revenge.\n\nStephens: An important point, David. I know liberals love to point out that MAGA politicians like Ted Cruz, Tom Cotton, Josh Hawley and Elise Stefanik all went to Ivy League schools (as did Donald Trump, though I doubt it was on account of merit). But those campus conservatives were always ideological minorities at elite colleges, and it’s where they learned to loathe the contempt they felt coming from liberal professors and peers.\n\nDouthat: Fortunately, all of us have learned to rise above it instead.\n\nStephens: At the University of Chicago, Ross, I was almost a liberal. Almost. Relatively speaking.\n\nFrench: I never did, Ross. That’s why I sued so many universities during my litigation career, but always with an eye toward protecting constitutional rights, not denying them to my political opponents.\n\nBrooks: A lot of elite conservatives continue to struggle with what I call the near-abroad problem. They may dislike MAGA, but they (we) are mostly around progressives or moderates on a day-to-day basis, by virtue of being elite. These progressives sometimes make our teeth hurt. We react more strongly to minor sins of the people across campus than the major sins of the people far away. This is something I’m working on.\n\nHealy: I want to bear down on the idea that more Americans think the country is on the right track with Trump. I have three theories to stress-test with you — or else I want to hear your own.\n\nOne: Authoritarians are popular, until they aren’t — that’s how it works.\n\nTwo: The enthusiasm is a honeymoon stemming from the November election, where Democrats got a big comeuppance from Trump.\n\nThree: A lot of Americans think Trump is generally right in both his diagnosis and Rx of government — that nothing terribly bad is going to happen, that the State Department can run foreign aid and the Treasury and the states can run Education Department programs, that tariffs will be a net positive in the long run, and that for all the sound and fury (and illegality), Trump 2.0 is trying to help America avoid becoming like societies struggling with long-term decline, weak national identities and sclerotic economies.\n\nAnd I’m open for business on a fourth theory, or more.\n\nDouthat: First, I would stress that Trump is not terribly popular, and undoubtedly will become less so if the stock market trends down and recession fears mount. He has a commanding position within his party, but even at his apotheosis his approval ratings barely got over 50 percent.\n\nSecond, Americans lived through the first Trump term, when sky-is-falling rhetoric was commonplace, but the average American did not experience a crisis until Covid hit. Then, through the Biden term, the media dialed back the crisis rhetoric dramatically, but in reality, inflation soared, the border seemed wide open, the world became much more dangerous, and the president was manifestly incapable of doing his job. So, while you can make a plausible case that this time is different, that Trump is more empowered and therefore more dangerous, you should still expect many Americans to wait for proof of that in their daily lives before they immediately re-embrace his first term’s narrative of crisis.\n\nBrooks: I’d take you back to a 1971 Clint Eastwood movie, “Dirty Harry,” or a 1974 Charles Bronson movie, “Death Wish.” Both of those were produced in a time of social decay, and they’re both about a guy who is willing to break or bend the rules to restore order. To this day, there is a large chunk of Americans who think the system is so broken, we need someone who will break the rules. That’s what’s happening.\n\nPlus, the unfortunate fact is that there is almost always a kernel of truth to Trump & Co.’s assaults. The most noxious thing they have done in my view is eviscerate U.S.A.I.D. Millions will die. But it was true that U.S.A.I.D. was a bureaucratic nightmare. A generation of administrators there tried to fix it. The problem — which the Trumpies don’t understand — is that a lot of the sinecures were established by members of Congress who insisted they not be removed. Trump policies are not 100 percent wrong; they are just overreactions. Destroying an agency rather than fixing what is wrong and saving what is right.\n\nStephens: Unless you happen to live within a few miles of Capitol Hill, you probably don’t give two figs whether our (sometimes misspent) foreign aid is distributed via a semiautonomous agency called U.S.A.I.D. or directly through the State Department itself. You also probably think it’s no tragedy that government workers should experience the periodic layoffs that the rest of American workers have lived through since forever. The sort of inside-the-Beltway moves that feel like political earthquakes to a certain kind of Washington insider leave Trump voters somewhere between indifferent and pleased.\n\nThe other point that can’t be emphasized enough: Trump wouldn’t be as popular as he is with his side of the country if Democrats and progressives weren’t as unpopular with most sides of the country. Just the fact that he drives the Rachel Maddows of the world into fits of rage and despair and thoughts of European exile is reason enough for many Americans to support him. Sometimes even including me.\n\nFrench: Those of us who follow politics closely always seem to forget that we’re the strange ones. I really question how much the average rank-and-file Republican even knows about most of these early controversies. If you’re watching Fox News or other right-wing outlets, you’re hearing a lot of stories about strange, “woke” programs funded by U.S.A.I.D. They don’t know about the lives that are saved or the lives that are at risk.\n\nThat means they won’t know, much less care, about any given political controversy until it affects them personally.\n\nHealy: I want to return to a word I used in the last question: illegality. Democrats and plenty of independents, and not a few judges, see illegality or evidence of it in some of Trump’s actions on federal spending, agency dismantlement, deportations, defiance of judicial rulings. Why do some conservatives see illegality differently?\n\nDouthat: First, some of these moves are not obviously illegal, and exist in a zone of contestation over presidential power and constitutional interpretation where a normal partisan naturally takes his own side’s side.\n\nHealy: We’ll get to some specific moves a bit later. Go on.\n\nDouthat: Second, I would emphasize that many Americans experienced the recent period of liberal power, especially under Covidian conditions, as much more authoritarian and lawless-feeling in its everyday impact — schools closed and masks mandated, ideological double standards for different forms of public gathering and protest, ideological speech codes tacitly or explicitly imposed — than anything they experienced under Trump.\n\nThis sense of things may change as Trump pushes the envelope of presidential power or as the right embraces its own forms of censoriousness. Indeed, already you can see some factions that aligned with Trump because they were anti-woke start to break away or critique MAGA excesses.\n\nBut it’s still important to grasp that for many Americans, the fights over presidential prerogatives within the federal bureaucracy feel much more distant from their own liberties than liberalism’s recent agenda did.\n\nStephens: What I see is a president doing things that are, if not outright illegal, genuinely scary, like trying to go after the Washington law firm representing Jack Smith, the former special counsel. At a minimum, Trump represents an almost unprecedented stress test to the judicial system and the separation of powers. And if he starts openly defying Supreme Court rulings à la Andrew Jackson, that’s when you’ll find me at the barricades.\n\nThat said, some of what Trump is doing is simply a turbocharged version of what his liberal predecessors did while the mainstream press remained mostly mum. Remember Barack Obama’s threats of unilateral executive action through his phone and his pen? Or Joe Biden’s almost open flouting of the Supreme Court with his student loan forgiveness schemes? I also think millions of Americans are tuning out some of the claims of Trump’s unconstitutional behavior as so much partisan noise. That’s one of the downsides of some of the more doubtful efforts by liberal prosecutors to put Trump in jail.\n\nFrench: First, I sincerely doubt that most Republicans think or believe that Trump has done anything illegal so far. Right-wing media is full of legal talking heads telling their loyal audiences that the various district judges are lawless. The right is even attacking Amy Coney Barrett, calling her a grifter or a RINO for exercising her independent judgment.\n\nWe’ve seen this pattern throughout the Trump years. Trump will advance an illegal or unconstitutional policy, MAGA lawyers will spring to MAGA media to rationalize and justify it, and then, when even conservative judges or justices block Trump’s actions, they scream that the courts are lawless, not Trump.\n\nBrooks: As a matter of principle, Democrats should be screaming bloody murder about Trump’s threat to the Constitution. As a matter of political tactics, I think they’re better off emphasizing Trumpian incompetence. Determining the constitutionality of some act requires a law degree, but incompetence is something we all recognize — and there is a lot of it.\n\nHealy: On the economy, I ask in all seriousness: Are Republicans really OK if Trump drives America into a recession? Listening to Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, this week, stock market corrections are healthy and recessions may be sometimes necessary. Putting aside the macroeconomic finer points there, I’m confused that so many Republicans think we’re on the right track when that track may be leading to recession. Are they not paying attention?\n\nFrench: It’s so important to distinguish between the core of MAGA — which dominates discourse online — from the bulk of voters who put Trump back in the White House. Online MAGA will pay any price and bear any burden for Trump; they’ll even buy electric cars to keep the DOGE dream alive. But the people who actually made him president were primarily concerned about prices, and it wasn’t close. If the economy tanks, MAGA will stay with Trump, but we know from the 2020 election that enough voters will step off the Trump train to swing the balance of power back to the Democrats.\n\nDouthat: It’s not unique to MAGA, though — real partisans don’t change their vote just because the economy goes bad, and especially not under polarized conditions. It’s not like the inflation under Biden suddenly made partisan Democrats open to a vote for Trump. But as David says, Trump’s current coalition includes a lot of not-that-partisan nonloyalists who voted for him because they thought he’d be good for the economy, and those voters will be voting Democratic in the midterms without a second thought if we’re in a recession.\n\nBrooks: I do think Trump’s popularity will plummet if the economy really heads south. People will tolerate a lot from their government, but not unnecessary chaos.\n\nHealy: And not when Trump promised an economic boom from Day 1.\n\nBrooks: People forget how many voters like Trump mostly because he’s a businessman who, they think, knows how to “grow the economy” (speaking of words that should have never been verbs). If that myth is busted, things will head south fast. In fact, I worry the political momentum will shift so fast that the Democrats won’t be ready to take advantage. They’ll still be dealing with their own trauma, intellectual incoherence and recriminations. They won’t have time to offer something new, which is why parties recently have not reformed themselves after defeat. The other side screws up too fast.\n\nStephens: Well, Treasury Secretary Bessent is right. Market corrections are healthy. Recessions should sometimes happen. Having the government or the Federal Reserve ensure that markets only go up is the road to inflating bubbles that ought to be pricked, and to zombifying large parts of the economy that ought to be allowed to die. The practice by presidents of both parties to ensure that profits are privatized and risk is socialized is a road to ruin.\n\nThe problem is, trying to go about this by jacking up tariffs in incoherent and unpredictable ways is the worst possible way of pricking bubbles. But I wouldn’t be so sure that the economy is going to tank. Markets usually like deregulation, permitting reform, “Drill, baby drill,” an extension of the 2017 tax cuts. And Trump can always lift the tariffs. Like Soviet diplomacy under Andrei Gromyko, Trump has a gift for creating crises so that he can take credit for solving them.\n\nHealy: I’d like to do a lightning round and go through actions Trump has taken and learn if you agree or disagree with each of them — to help readers understand how the four of you with histories on the right see these issues. First: Trump’s negotiations with President Vladimir Putin of Russia to end the war in Ukraine.\n\nBrooks: Let’s not overthink this — siding with a villainous dictator against a brave democrat is repulsive. That said, I don’t think we’re going to return to the postwar international order. The 21st century was bound to look a lot different from the 20th. Those of us internationalists have some thinking to do.\n\nDouthat: Negotiating with Putin in some form is an absolute strategic necessity, given the situation of the war and American power overall. Which doesn’t mean that Trump will produce a good deal.\n\nFrench: Of all the outrages of Trump’s first two months, his betrayal of Ukraine is likely to be the most consequential. If he continues on this course, he’ll hand Russia a military victory, rip the heart out of the Western alliance, and place a diminished America in a bystander role as great power competition likely leads to nuclear proliferation and greater international instability.\n\nI agree with David that the 21st century is going to look different from the 20th. But this does not mean our alliances are somehow less valuable, and that it’s better for America to alienate Europe for the sake of embracing Russia.\n\nWe should want the European powers to increase defense spending as partners and friends, not as angry, estranged former allies. We need their help.\n\nStephens: Trump at his absolute worst. A betrayal of the free world and its courageous champions in Ukraine. A betrayal of the promises of the Atlantic Charter and 80 years of American global leadership against totalitarian aggression. And a portent of betrayal for every other small country — whether it’s Latvia, Taiwan or Israel — that looks to America for the protection of independence and liberty. I can only hope Putin’s refusal to agree to a cease-fire does something to sober Trump’s judgment.\n\nHealy: The federal government sending hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants to a prison in El Salvador, deciding they were gang members even as a federal judge was assessing their cases, and doing so even though the judge ordered the deportation flights to turn around and head back to the United States.\n\nStephens: I’d need to learn a few more details, but it sounds legally iffy. Still, not the hill Trump’s critics should want to die on.\n\nDouthat: Deporting gang leaders is good. But claiming wartime powers to go around the normal deportation system seems guaranteed — as in the War on Terror, to stress again Trump’s continuity with past Republicans — to yield abuses and mistakes, and that may have already happened in this case.\n\nHealy: Trump calling for the impeachment of that judge — and the notion of impeaching or disregarding judges generally whom Trump disagrees with.\n\nStephens: Terrible. I only stop to observe that all the liberals who went berserk over John Roberts’s nomination to the court 20 years ago owe the chief justice an apology, especially after his intervention in this case. He’s a model of conservative jurisprudence.\n\nDouthat: Trump’s rhetoric against his opponents, judicial or otherwise, always goes too far. But I think elected officials aggressively attacking judges who make aggressive rulings is a completely normal part of democratic politics in a country with a powerful judicial branch, and I would say the same about many sweeping liberal attacks on the Roberts court and its conservative justices in the last few years.\n\nBrooks: Atrocious. As usual, Trump is being patrimonialist — treating the U.S. government like his own family business.\n\nFrench: It’s not just dreadful, but it’s also part of a calculated attack on the role of the judiciary in the constitutional order. Russell Vought, Trump’s influential head of Office of Management and Budget, has said that the right “needs to throw off the precedents and legal paradigms that have wrongly developed over the last 200 years, and to study carefully the words of the Constitution and how the founders would have responded in modern situations to the encroachments of other branches.”\n\nBrooks: Pure cruelty. This is one of those issues where anecdotes prevail over reality. We need to be able to defeat China in a possible naval confrontation. Is this really what we should be thinking about?\n\nStephens: I don’t think the military was “cruel” when transgender people were barred from military service for the first seven and a half years of Barack Obama’s presidency. This is an example of the deep disconnect between the moral certitudes of the part of the country that rarely serves in the military and the cultural convictions of the part of the country that often does — and on whom we all depend for our safety.\n\nFrench: I see the matter primarily as a question of readiness, not rights. Medical transitions can be very physically challenging, sometimes including physically debilitating treatments. That can affect readiness a great deal. In that circumstance, the question is less about transgender status and more about the physical realities of complex medical procedures.\n\nDouthat: I will just say that the policy seems to be obviously within the commander in chief’s constitutional powers, and the judicial ruling to the contrary is a good example of why many conservatives don’t feel they need to take the wider run of anti-Trump rulings all that seriously.\n\nHealy: Here’s my last question — I’ve been asking a lot about specific policies. A lot of Republicans like what they are seeing. But are they missing the forest for the trees? Do the individual policies matter if America’s economy tanks, if there’s a constitutional crisis over defying court orders, if there’s geopolitical upheaval in Ukraine or Eastern Europe or Taiwan?\n\nDouthat: We are two months into the presidency, and we just lived through four years of dramatic global and domestic upheaval under a Democratic president whose manifest incapacity was deliberately concealed from the country. I have a million concerns about where this administration is going, but it’s a bit soon to attack the president’s supporters for being irrationally loyal.\n\nBrooks: Personally, I think Trump has set the world record for over-reading his mandate. I think his incompetence and bad character will drag him far lower this term than they did in his first. (This term, Trump is actually trying to do things.) But I wake up each morning and ask: What if I’m wrong? What if Trump wins the next four years? We’re entering an era of junkyard dog politics. Maybe Trump is the guy to stand up to Xi Jinping. Maybe governments need a pummeling cleanse before they can reinvent themselves. Maybe the vibe shift is permanent and the progressive march through the institutions is over. Maybe the American economy is a wonder to behold and it survives what Trump is throwing at it while our allies continue to stagnate.\n\nIf people like me focus on all the Trump failures that make us feel good, we may once again get run over by reality.\n\nFrench: The big disasters (or big triumphs) always swamp individual policies, and most people judge presidents through the prism of their own personal situation. That’s exactly why Jan. 6, 2021, didn’t end Trump’s political career. Very few voters liked it, but they didn’t see it as relevant to their lives — at least not nearly as relevant as the price of groceries or disorder in the streets.\n\nI completely agreed with the Democratic message that the rule of law was on the ballot in 2024, but I also know that voters will put up with an enormous amount of scandal and misconduct if the economy is strong and have no patience for corruption when the economy is weak. The “rule of law” is abstract. The price of eggs is concrete.\n\nThat’s why Trump’s incompetence is a greater threat to his presidency than his cruelty. A malicious man can win over the masses if jobs are plentiful and gas is cheap.\n\nStephens: On most days since Trump took office, the line that has run through my head is from the movie “Airplane!”: “Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue.” It’s just one damn thing after another.\n\nBut like David Brooks, I am a chastened Trump critic. I viewed his first term as a national embarrassment culminating in the epic disgrace of Jan. 6. Clearly, plenty of Americans didn’t see it my way, or they noticed things to which I was mostly indifferent: growing prosperity, a new attentiveness to the proverbial forgotten man — and the vapid, arrogant, hypocritical awfulness of many a Trump scold.\n\nSo, to adapt Larry David, I’m going to Curb My Nausea. Just please pass me the Dramamine, will you, Patrick?",

        "full_text": "The following content is sponsored by Americans for Limited Government.\n\nThe Trump administration should set its sights on the middlemen who drive up healthcare costs.\n\nIn his quest to eliminate wasteful federal spending, President Trump has a Cheesecake Factory-sized menu to choose from when it comes to healthcare. Once the Trump administration turns its attention to this sector, it will quickly discover that foreign aid was a mere appetizer to the fatty center of America’s bloated health apparatus.\n\nTake Medicaid, the government health program meant to provide coverage to low-income and disabled Americans. In 2023 alone, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office found the program lost $50 billion to “improper payments,” a term used to describe waste and fraud. That’s more than USAID’s total budget for the year.\n\nLast year, the Federal Trade Commission claimed that Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) “abused their economic power by rigging pharmaceutical supply chain competition in their favor, forcing patients to pay more for life-saving medication. According to the complaint, these PBMs, known as the Big Three, together administer about 80 percent of all prescriptions in the United States.” PBMs’ combined revenue is over $1 trillion. It equals 22 percent of national health expenditures. This begs the question, what makes American healthcare so different than the others – and the answer is clear – American healthcare is plagued by a labyrinth of middlemen insurance intermediaries driven by profits, instead of patient care.\n\nIn today’s world, providers and patients no longer have control of their healthcare and must constantly navigate the increased red tape stemming from healthcare supply chain middleman meddling. Middlemen continuously claim they are lowering American’s healthcare costs. So, one would think that Americans would get something for all this spending, but patient costs have actually soared.\n\nThe Biden administration made the problem worse by growing the healthcare system’s bureaucracy through laws like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The IRA raided Medicare to the tune of roughly $273 billion, with part of the savings being funneled to Big Insurance bailouts to mask the high cost of Obamacare plans.\n\nBut those middlemen just make the system less efficient. A recent study found that increased third-party healthcare spending leads to higher spending and waste. Without control over their dollars, patients lose their ability to make their own choices and shop for better prices.\n\nWho thrives on inefficiency, you may ask? Middlemen. Prescription drugs are a great case study. Believing the high cost of certain pharmaceutical products was due to a lack of government involvement, Biden’s IRA put federal bureaucrats in charge of “negotiating” pharmaceutical prices. However, the law willingly ignored a much bigger problem: the presence of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) who negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers and quietly pocket most of the resulting savings intended to go to patients.\n\nA 2024 U.S. Federal Trade Commission report found that “these powerful middlemen may be profiting by inflating drug costs and squeezing Main Street pharmacies.” The report noted that the three largest PBMs now manage nearly 80 percent of all prescriptions filled in the U.S. “As a result, [PBMs] wield enormous power and influence over patients’ access to drugs and the prices they pay.”\n\nThe 340B drug pricing program is another inefficiency that empowers middlemen over patients. Under 340B, hospitals can purchase discounted drugs for uninsured and low-income patients. However, 340B has become a hospital markup program. Many 340B hospitals and the PBMs they use to purchase the drugs have figured out how to game the system. CVS, one of the biggest PBMs, disclosed that it takes in massive profits from 340B.\n\nThe former CEO of a corporate chain pharmacy company said that the size of the 340B program was exploding and that they would “take full advantage.” “340B gross sales across the program are expected to grow from $116B in 2021 to $280B in 2026. We intend to take full advantage of the momentum this sector presents.”\n\nInstead of passing the discounted prices down to vulnerable patients, 340B hospitals charge patients or their insurer the full price of the drugs and either pocket the difference or share the proceeds with their PBM.\n\nThe middleman madness within the American healthcare system must stop. President Trump has an opportunity to expose how much PBMs and 340B abuses drive up U.S. healthcare spending. Congress should pass much-needed reforms that rein in this waste and protect patients.\n\nThe Trump administration should also find ways to reduce administrative spending in health care. In the way that Trump’s nominee to lead the FDA, Dr. Marty Makary, famously called attention to the wasteful habit of hospitals throwing away clean, single-use medical devices, this administration must blow the whistle on red tape that drives waste. Every dollar spent on administrative overhead is a dollar not being invested in patient care or the next generation of medical innovation.\n\nThe Trump administration can help patients by diverting resources away from programs that don’t make America healthy. Now is the time.",

        "full_text": "A pipeline company’s victory in court over Greenpeace, and the huge damages it now faces, will encourage other oil and gas companies to legally pursue environmental protesters at a time when Donald Trump’s energy agenda is in ascendancy, experts have warned.\n\nOn Wednesday a North Dakota jury ruled that three Greenpeace entities collectively must pay Energy Transfer, which was co-founded by a prominent Trump donor, more than $660m, deciding that the organizations were liable for defamation and other claims after a five-week trial in Mandan, near where the Dakota Access pipeline protests occurred in 2016 and 2017.\n\n“This verdict will embolden other energy companies to take legal action against protesters who physically block their projects,” said Michael Gerrard, the founder and faculty director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School.\n\n“It will chill those kinds of protests; whether the chilling goes beyond that remains to be seen. It won’t inhibit litigation against fossil fuel projects; we will surely see more of those as the Trump administration advances its ‘drill, baby, drill’ agenda.”\n\nKevin Cramer, the US senator from North Dakota, cheered Wednesday’s huge judgment against Greenpeace over the pipeline protests in his state, congratulating the energy company who sued the environmental group for its big win.\n\nJustice was served, he said. “They can think twice now about doing it again,” he said of Greenpeace and other environmental groups who protested against the Dakota Access pipeline.\n\nBrian Hauss, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, said that the lawsuit served as a “tax on speech”, one that makes it too expensive to go against “litigious, deep-pocketed corporations”.\n\n“If companies can sue critics, advocates and protesters into oblivion for their speech and the unlawful acts of third parties, then no one will feel safe protesting corporate malfeasance,” Hauss said.\n\nIn the days since the ruling was issued, environmental groups and protest movements have reacted with shock and dismay, warning that its impact stretches far beyond any individual organization.\n\nAmnesty International said the “devastating verdict sets an array of deeply damaging precedents on the rights to freedom of speech, association and peaceful protest and puts the very future of Greenpeace at risk”.\n\nSome legal experts were surprised the case even made it before a jury. Similar claims often get tossed out over first amendment concerns or because many states prevent so-called Slapp suits (strategic lawsuits against public participation). North Dakota doesn’t have an anti-Slapp law.\n\nGreenpeace’s goals – such as protecting the climate and preserving oceans – won’t change, said Sushma Raman, the interim executive director of Greenpeace USA. But “it’s really going to be a question of capacity and prioritization, which happens in any organization that is facing an existential threat of this kind,” Raman said.\n\n“Ultimately, this isn’t about the money for them,” Raman said of Energy Transfer. “It’s really about sending a message, and it’s trying to silence an organization that they feel is a thorn in their side.”\n\nEnergy Transfer’s CEO, Kelcy Warren, has donated millions to pro-Trump groups and given directly to the president’s campaigns over the years. He has made a mission of going after pipeline opponents, including Greenpeace, filing several lawsuits to that end.\n\nSome conservatives have celebrated his approach. Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, said it was “great news!” that the verdict could bankrupt Greenpeace. Erick Erickson, a conservative talkshow host, said Warren was his hero. “I’m a longtime shareholder of Energy Transfer and his campaign to destroy Greenpeace has been awesome to behold. God bless him,” Erickson wrote on X.\n\nShayana “Shane” Kadidal, a senior managing attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, called to mind economic boycotts during the US civil rights movement that inflicted damage on white-owned businesses, and how those businesses retaliated with civil lawsuits against groups such as the NAACP, trying to frame their activism as a conspiracy.\n\n“Billionaire oligarchs like Elon Musk and Energy Transfer’s Kelcy Warren now pose one of the most significant risks to free speech globally,” Kadidal said.\n\nGreenpeace began in the 1970s with a campaign led by Canadian activists to block nuclear weapons testing on an Alaskan island, its roots based in direct action. US offshoots grew throughout that decade. It is headquartered in the Netherlands, where it has filed an anti-Slapp lawsuit against Energy Transfer.\n\nIt has said it got involved in the Dakota Access protests because the tribe, the Standing Rock Sioux, asked for its help. The organization has a policy of only getting involved in Indigenous-led movements if specifically asked, the New York Times reported.\n\nWaniya Locke, of Standing Rock Grassroots, said the verdict “attempts to erase Indigenous leadership from Standing Rock’s history” and part of a “coordinated attack on communities organizing to protect their water and futures from big oil”.\n\nThe Greenpeace case isn’t the only recent example of a heightened legal attack on free speech. Protesters on US college campuses have been met with disciplinary actions for supporting Palestinian human rights, the most extreme example involving the push to deport a former Columbia student, Mahmoud Khalil. Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, has sued his critics.\n\nThe International Center for Not-for-Profit Law has tracked a rise in anti-protest bills since 2017, corresponding with major protest movements including actions against pipelines, on college campuses, for teachers and for racial justice. These proposals include “extreme” penalties for protest-related offenses like trespassing near a pipeline, the center notes in its analysis. They also call for expanded liability for organizations or individuals that aren’t directly involved in protests. “Non-profits, religious groups, and others will be much more reluctant to support or organize protected protests if they face possible penalties for the unlawful actions of others,” the center said in its analysis.\n\nThe verdict is not the end for this case – Greenpeace has said it will appeal to the North Dakota supreme court. Legal experts believe the organization has a better shot on appeal, citing the jury’s ties to the oil and gas industry and the broad disapproval of the protest among local residents.\n\nIn the defeat, there has also been resolve.\n\n“You can’t sue or bankrupt a movement,” Raman said.",

        "full_text": "Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino.\n\nQuick Take\n\nIn 2017, President Donald Trump expressed admiration for Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s deadly war on drug suspects. But social media posts have falsely claimed that Trump has ordered Duterte’s release from the International Criminal Court, where he faces charges of crimes against humanity. We could find no response from Trump regarding Duterte’s arrest.\n\nFull Story\n\nFormer Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested by police in Manila on March 11 and was flown to The Hague, where he faces charges of crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court.\n\nA March 12 ICC press release said the court “found reasonable grounds to believe that Mr Duterte is individually responsible as an indirect co-perpetrator for the crime against humanity of murder, allegedly committed in the Philippines” between November 2011 and March 2019.\n\nICC judges “found that there was an attack directed against a civilian population pursuant to an organisational policy while Mr Duterte was the head of the Davao Death Squad (DDS), and pursuant to a State policy while he was the President of the Philippines. Moreover, there are reasonable grounds to believe that this attack was both widespread and systematic: the alleged attack took place over a period of several years and resulted in thousands of deaths,” the press release said.\n\nThe ICC charges refer to Duterte’s anti-drug war during his years as mayor of Davao and as Philippine president, when more than 6,000 suspects were killed without trial by Duterte’s police during anti-drug operations.\n\nDuterte has said he did not authorize extrajudicial killings, but he “openly threatened drug suspects with death and ordered law enforcers to shoot suspects, who threaten them with harm,” the Associated Press reported in a 2022 article.\n\nDuterte’s war on drugs drew the admiration of Donald Trump during his first term as president. The New York Times reported that Trump told Duterte in a 2017 phone call, “I just wanted to congratulate you because I am hearing of the unbelievable job on the drug problem. Many countries have the problem, we have a problem, but what a great job you are doing and I just wanted to call and tell you that,” Trump said.\n\nBut since Duterte’s extradition to the Netherlands by the ICC, social media posts have fabricated claims about Trump’s response to Duterte’s arrest.\n\nA March 13 Facebook post falsely claimed, in part, “President Donald Trump has reportedly signed an executive order demanding the immediate release of former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte from the custody of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. Sources close to the White House claim that Trump, calling Duterte ‘a great friend and a tough guy,’ acted swiftly after Duterte’s arrest.”\n\nThe post went on to wrongly claim there was an “Executive Order 2025-03: Restoration of Justice for Allied Leaders,” saying that it “declares that the ICC has ‘no right to meddle in the affairs of strong leaders doing their jobs.’ The document allegedly mandates that U.S. forces stationed in Europe ‘extract and return’ Duterte to the Philippines within 48 hours, threatening economic sanctions against the Netherlands if the ICC fails to comply.”\n\nAnother Facebook post — which includes an image of Trump with Duterte generated with artificial intelligence — refers to the same fictional executive order and claims it calls for the deployment of “a specialized unit of U.S. Navy SEALs” to the Netherlands to extract Duterte “with all necessary equipment, firepower, and authority to get the job done.”\n\nBut there is no record of any such executive order or presidential action by Trump related to Duterte’s arrest. One red flag in these posts is the number of the supposed EO: “2025-03.” That’s not how executive orders are numbered. The Federal Register publishes all executive orders, and they are easily searchable through the American Presidency Project’s website.\n\nIn addition, we could not find any reports of Trump issuing a statement in response to the ICC arrest of the former Philippine president. We reached out to the White House for comment on the social media claims but did not receive a response.\n\nThe Philippines-based fact-checking website Vera Files debunked similar social media claims that were misleadingly presented as if they were from a BBC News report. Vera Files said, “There are no verified records of Trump or any other official U.S. government agency” expressing support for Duterte following his arrest.\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Meta to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

        "full_text": "“Elon Musk is out of control, and now the power-hungry billionaire is unloading millions to buy the Wisconsin Supreme Court,” the ad’s narrator says, citing the more than $7 million that a Musk-backed super PAC has dropped on the race. “He knows corrupt politician Brad Schimel is for sale and will abolish the checks and balances that protect us.”\n\nThe Musk-centric ad blitz is the latest evidence that Democrats believe the billionaire is a more potent line of attack than tying Republicans to President Donald Trump — and the results out of Wisconsin could affect how Democrats deploy Musk-related messaging in legislative elections in New Jersey and Virginia this year and in the midterms in 2026.\n\nArmed with private and public polling, Democrats in Wisconsin see Musk as an animating force that could compel Democratic-leaning and independent voters to back Susan Crawford, the Dane County judge who’s running against Schimel.\n\n“Democrats are furious about Musk, and independents are increasingly freaked out about the way that Musk is attacking things like Social Security and childhood brain cancer research,” said Ben Wikler, chair of the state Democratic Party. “Our test of our first Musk ad found that it moved likely 2025 voters by 6.2 percentage points.”\n\nIn Wisconsin, Wikler added, “we have a chance to demonstrate in this race that his money is politically toxic.”\n\nMusk looms unusually large in Wisconsin. Unlike Trump, he has directly intervened in the race through his super PAC, America PAC. Tesla, one of Musk’s companies, is also suing Wisconsin to challenge a state law forbidding it from opening dealerships in the state, a case that could go before the state Supreme Court.\n\nIn an April 1 election of an off-year, juicing participation among the base is the strategy for both parties. For Wisconsin Democrats, 97 percent of their party’s voters disapprove of Musk, according to a recent Marquette University survey.\n\n“These attacks on Musk are going to find a very receptive Democratic base of voters,” said Charles Franklin, who leads the Marquette University polling. “This is how they’re nationalizing the race, in hopes that party polarization will be enough and that it’ll boost Democratic turnout.”\n\nBut even some Democrats have warned against leaning too hard on Musk. Mandela Barnes, the state’s former lieutenant governor who lost a bid for Senate in 2022, said the ads may be “effective,” but that “my only fear here is that Elon Musk just won’t be enough because the question is still, ‘Well, what are Democrats doing besides saying how bad Elon Musk is? When will Dems actually show up?’”\n\nWikler argued that the ads “connect Musk’s corruption to the attacks on people’s lives,” like the potential cuts to Social Security, because “one of the biggest lessons from 2024 is to constantly bring out communication back to the things in voters’ lives they care most about.”\n\nRepublicans, too, are seeking to nationalize the Wisconsin campaign. They’ve held a two-to-one financial advantage in outside spending over pro-Crawford groups, with $22 million backing Schimel compared to $11 million supporting Crawford, according to a POLITICO analysis. But Democrats, using state party money, lead Republicans in pro-Crawford TV ad spending, $30.5 million to $26.3 million so far, according to AdImpact, an ad-tracking firm.\n\nRepublicans have tied Crawford to liberal mega-donor George Soros and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who have both donated in the race. Mailers sent by the Musk-backed super PAC to voters said Schimel “will support” Trump’s agenda.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. and Turning Point Action founder Charlie Kirk headlined a rally for Schimel this week, with Trump Jr. warning voters that his father’s “presidency can be put to a halt with this vote.” Trump himself has not yet endorsed in the race.\n\n“What people want to know about the Supreme Court candidates is all about crime, so [Schimel] is using his law enforcement background to focus on crime and safety, which is exactly what he should be doing,” said Mark Graul, a Republican consultant in Wisconsin who has worked on several other state Supreme Court races. “Then, through micro-targeting, do what you can to turn out those irregular April voters who are Trump supporters.”\n\nIn a statement, Schimel’s communications director Jacob Fischer said: “Susan Crawford was caught attempting to sell congressional seats to out-of-state billionaires for campaign contributions, prompting the support of extremists like George Soros and JB Pritzker. The attempts by Susan Crawford and the Democrats to distract the people of Wisconsin from her extreme views and the radical billionaires funding her are a mockery of hypocrisy.”\n\nBut it’s Musk — and Democrats’ effort to yoke him to Schimel — that will be dominating the airwaves on behalf of Democrats in the closing weeks, even as abortion and public safety have also been emphasized in TV ads. A second ad, backed by the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, uses audio of Schimel saying he needs to “invest in knee pads” because he has to “crawl around begging people” to financially support his bid. The ad then cuts to images of Musk, who “needs a guaranteed vote” on the state Supreme Court because he’s “suing the state of Wisconsin.”\n\n“Schimel begged, and Musk unloaded $10 million to rig the court,” the ad’s narrator says. “So how much does it cost to buy off a corrupt politician? Just ask Brad Schimel.”\n\nInternal Democratic data found that this ad was especially effective at chipping away at Schimel’s favorability, reducing it by 14 percent among moderate voters.\n\n“Republicans seem to be operating with this fantasy that Musk’s millions can protect them from voters that are enraged by attacks on things they depend on to keep a roof over their head,” Wikler said. “But that fantasy is about to be put to the only real test, which is what happens at the ballot box.”\n\nBut Republicans argued that the long-term efficacy of tying Republicans to Musk may not pay off for Democrats.\n\n“It may be effective in a special because it’s a base play, trying to demonstrate they’re fighting back against Trump. But it’s not plausible long term,” said Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster who is not involved in the Wisconsin race. “Trump could push Musk to the side at any time, if they determine he’s a millstone and that takes away their attack, so to think this is going to have an impact on the 2026 elections, it’s way too premature.”",

        "full_text": "Republicans are not the only lawmakers facing confrontational town halls over the congressional recess. Democratic lawmakers are increasingly facing the ire of the party’s liberal base over their response to the Trump administration.\n\nRep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.) clashed with pro-Palestinian attendees at a town hall Wednesday, leading police to shut down the forum. That followed Rep. Glenn Ivey’s (D-Md.) town hall Tuesday, where he faced criticism for being too “calm” in the face of the Trump administration. And in California, Democratic Rep. Gil Cisneros faced constituents angry about Social Security, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, potential cuts to Medicaid and fired federal workers.\n\n“I wish you’d be angry,” one woman said, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nAnd it’s not just House Democrats in safe districts taking heat from liberal constituents. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) responded to frustrated constituents at a town hall Wednesday by saying that her job is to be “more than just an activist” and that “yelling” from progressives has not stopped President Trump.\n\nThe raucous events come as Democrats have sought to use town halls to target GOP lawmakers in their own districts. The town halls have Republicans and Democrats on edge, as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are put on the defensive on home turf.\n\n“If you’re home, my town halls look like a Republican town hall. I’m not taking it personally. People are scared. They want to see us do something,” Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) told CBS News’s “Face the Nation” over the weekend.\n\nThe confrontations also come as Democrats continue to struggle to find their footing during the second Trump administration. And recent polling paints a dismal picture of the state of the party.\n\nAn NBC News poll released Sunday found that only 27 percent of voters said they had a positive view of the Democratic Party, while 55 percent of voters said they have a negative view of it. Additionally, 20 percent of Democrats in the poll said they had a negative view of the party.\n\nA separate CNN poll also released Sunday had similar findings, showing the party with a record-low 29 percent favorability rating. Fifty-two percent of Democratic-aligned adults said the leadership of the Democratic Party is currently taking the party in the wrong direction, compared to 48 percent who said the party’s leaders were taking them in the right direction.\n\nThis week’s town halls appeared to be a manifestation of that data.\n\n“[Democratic leadership] neglects to see the army of pitchforks behind them ready to fight back if they’re willing to take action,” said Sawyer Hackett, a progressive Democratic strategist.\n\n“Right now, what we’re seeing is those pitchforks aren’t necessarily on our side,” he continued. “Their anger is pointed at Democratic lawmakers.”\n\nThere is growing frustration from Democrats across the ideological spectrum over Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), along with nine other Senate Democrats, helping Republicans advance a House GOP-drafted government funding resolution. Liberals had hoped the Democrats would use the Senate filibuster to block the bill.\n\n“We’ve had one source of leverage to push back on these people and do everything we can to grind the gears of government to a halt to fight back, and we didn’t use it,” Hackett said.\n\nEven Democrats who voted against the resolution in their respective chambers, like Ivey and Slotkin, have faced tough questions over the future of their party at town halls.\n\n“Voting the right way is literally the least you can do,” said Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. “The expectation is that Democratic elected officials proactively do things to show that they get that we’re in an existential fight for the future of America.”\n\n“Anybody on the inside who does not understand that their role in this moment in time is to be an organizer in addition to a policymaker, is failing to meet the moment. That’s an absolute fact,” Green said.\n\nOne attendee at Ivey’s town hall Tuesday told the congressman that his constituents “want him to show fight, and you are not fighting.”\n\n“It’s not that you’re in the minority, it’s that you’re not even working on a shared strategy, and that is failure,” the attendee shouted, garnering applause.\n\n“The message you should clearly take to your colleagues from your constituents is this: We are not interested in hearing that you’re in the minority. We know that. We want you to show some of the backbone and strategic brilliance that Mitch McConnell would have in the minority,” the attendee said.\n\nProgressives say Democratic officials and lawmakers need to take Trump and Musk head on, not just through votes.\n\n“I wish more Democratic lawmakers would call for boycotts of Musk’s products,” Hackett said. “I wish more Democratic lawmakers would pressure their Democratic states to cut contracts with SpaceX, to cut contracts with Starlink, to cut contracts with Tesla charging stations.”\n\n“Democratic leadership seems to think that they can just lay low and point at Republicans until the midterms,” he said.\n\nDemocratic strategist Antjuan Seawright noted Democrats are “fighting with alligator arms tied behind their back in this case,” but said the key battle will be at the ballot box in 2026.\n\n“We’ve got to keep our eye on the bigger prize, and that’s winning elections, because that’s how we change the tone,” he said. “But it doesn’t mean that leaders in our party get a free pass on making bad political decisions.”\n\nRepublican lawmakers are also grappling with viral videos emerging from heated town halls. Republicans have blamed the interruptions on Democratic agitators, and earlier this month House GOP leadership urged members to hold virtual events or telephone town halls as opposed to in-person events. Democrats have used the opportunity to put their Republican counterparts on defense by traveling to GOP districts to hold town halls.\n\n“What we are seeing in town halls across the country is a rejection of the failed Republican agenda, and it’s why vulnerable House Republicans are hiding from their constituents. They know they are witnessing the beginning of the end of their majority,” said Viet Shelton, a spokesperson at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nProgressives say there are Democratic lawmakers who are taking a step in the right direction. A number of Democratic senators have gone on the offense this week, holding town halls in GOP House districts within their respective states.\n\n“If one is reading tea leaves, the willingness of Democratic senators to go to House Republican districts within their state and step on toes to fight for the future of America, is hopefully a good signal of backbone to come,” Green said.\n\nProgressive figures such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) are taking matters into their own hands, hitting the road on their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour. Sanders told The New York Times on Thursday that a goal of the tour is to encourage more people to “run as independents outside of the Democratic Party.”\n\nAt the Las Vegas stop of the tour Thursday with Rep. Steven Horsford (D-Nev.), Ocasio-Cortez told attendees to “look at every level office around and support brawlers who fight.”\n\n“Because those are the ones who can actually win against Republicans. Let’s be real about that,” she said.",

And now when caught, they just shrug and say they were lying all along.\n\nOnce it was known that the first COVID-19 case originated in or near a Chinese communist virology lab engineering gain-in-function deadly viruses -- with help from Western agencies -- the left went into full persecution mode.\n\nThey damned as incompetent, racist, and conspiratorial any who dared follow logic and evidence to point out that the Chinese government and its military were both culpable for the virus and lying.\n\nA million Americans died of COVID. Millions more suffered long-term injuries. Still, the left-wing media and Biden administration demonized any who dared speak about a lab origin of the deadly virus.\n\nThe lies were designed to protect the guilty who had helped fund the virus's origins, such as Doctors Anthony Fauci and Francis Collins.\n\nThe Biden government also tried to use the lab theory to ridicule a supposedly pro-Trump \"conspiracy.\"\n\nWestern corporate interests deeply invested in China did not want their partner held responsible for veritably killing and maiming hundreds of millions worldwide.\n\nAlmost as soon as Joe Biden was inaugurated, the left knew that he was physically and mentally unable to serve as president.\n\nIndeed, that was the point.\n\nBiden's role was designed as a waxen figurine for hard-left agendas that, without the \"old Joe Biden from Scranton\" pseudo-moderate veneer, could never have been advanced.\n\nHis handlers operated a nightmare administration: the destruction of deterrence abroad, two theater wars, 12 million illegal aliens, a weaponized justice system, hyperinflation, and $7 trillion more in debt.\n\nBy 2017, the public knew three truths about the so-called Christopher Steele dossier.\n\nOne, it was completely fallacious -- fabricated by a has-been, ex-British spy Christopher Steele. He childishly had cobbled together lurid sex stories, James Bond spy fictions, and Russian-fed disinformation to destroy the Trump candidacy and later presidency.\n\nTwo, it was paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign. She hid her checks behind the Democratic National Committee, the Perkins Coie law firm, and Fusion GSP paywalls.\n\nThree, the FBI under James Comey hired Steele as an informant. It helped disseminate his concocted files and was also instrumental in trying to subvert the Trump campaign and later administration.\n\nNo sane person ever believed that Hunter Biden's laptop was the work of \"Russian disinformation.\" Its contents a year before the 2020 election were verified by the FBI, but it kept mum about its confirmation.\n\nThe pornographic pictures, the evidence of prostitution and drug use, the electronic communications implicating Joe Biden in his family's illicit shake-down operation of foreign governments -- all were never challenged by anyone who was associated with the laptop's contents.\n\nYet future Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, along with former interim CIA Director Mike Morrell, sought to fabricate a colossal lie to arm their candidate, Joe Biden, with plausible denial in the last presidential debate before the 2020 election.\n\nThey rounded up a rogue's gallery of 51 now utterly discredited former intelligence authorities to lie to the nation that the laptop was likely fake.\n\nAll knew the FBI had verified the laptop. But they also knew that their titles would empower their lies that the Russians likely invented the laptop to aid the sinister Trump.\n\nAnd the ruse worked like a charm.\n\nIn the debate, Biden cited their lies chapter and verse to claim the incriminating laptop was fake. A lying media damned Trump as a puppet of Vladimir Putin. Biden, little more than a week later, won the 2020 election.\n\nThe Biden administration deliberately destroyed the southern border and welcomed 12 million illegal aliens. And then it lied that Biden had no power to stop the influx.\n\nThe media fabricated the excuse that \"comprehensive immigration reform\" was needed to enforce federal immigration laws already on the books.\n\nUpon inauguration, Trump, in a matter of days, stopped what Biden had deliberately engineered for years.\n\nBiden's handlers wanted new millions of poor illegal aliens, dependent on social services, to swarm the borders.\n\nThey saw them as future voters and constituents to fuel their victim/victimizer Marxist binaries.\n\nAnd they now quietly see their efforts as a huge success -- knowing that it will be near impossible to find the millions of illegal aliens they welcomed in.\n\nAll these lies have divided the country and permanently damaged the U.S.\n\nThe perpetrators have neither apologized for their lies nor tried to either deny or substantiate them.\n\nNo one involved has ever been held legally accountable.\n\nThe legacy media permanently ruined its reputation and will likely never be seen as credible again.\n\nThe Biden administration, overseer of many of these lies, will be regarded as the most duplicitous and dishonest presidency in modern history.",

        "full_text": "MIAMI (AP) — In Hialeah, Florida, a city that’s 95% Hispanic, only three residents showed up at a recent city council meeting to speak against a partnership with the federal government to enforce immigration laws.\n\nThe police departments in Hialeah, where three out of four people were born abroad, and Coral Gables, with a majority of Hispanics mostly of Cuban descent, have entered into agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement with very little visible pushback.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s doubling of immigration arrests and ramping up of deportations could have a disproportionate impact on South Florida, home to some of the nation’s largest communities of Cubans, Venezuelans and other Latin Americans. But reaction here to Trump’s crackdown has been far more muted than during his first term, reflecting both the rightward shift of Latino voters and a belief among some that restrictive border measures are necessary.\n\n“I understand some people feel a little bit betrayed because most of us voted him in,” said Frank Ayllon, a 41-year-old sales representative from Miami. “I feel like a lot of these people are taking it very personal. And it’s not personal. It’s just that you’ve got to understand that this has been an open border for many years.”\n\nAyllon echoed Trump’s attacks on former President Joe Biden, whose administration saw record-high illegal border crossings before falling by the end of his term. Having once been critical Trump’s 2020 election lies, Ayllon now says he thought the president has had the most action-packed beginning of a term he has ever seen.\n\nA political shift begins to stick\n\nWhen Miami-Dade County ordered jail officials in 2017 to hold people suspected of being in the U.S. illegally, dozens lined up to speak against the order at a public meeting, with some shouting “shame on you.” Lawmakers including former Vice President Kamala Harris, then California’s junior senator, joined large protests outside a local immigrant detention facility.\n\nNow in Trump’s second term, the protest movement is splintered. But there’s also been a broader political shift in South Florida and Latino communities.\n\nWhile Harris in the 2024 presidential election won more than half of Hispanic voters, that support was down slightly from the roughly 6 in 10 Hispanic voters that Biden won in 2020. Roughly half of Latino men voted for Harris, down from about 6 in 10 who went for Biden.\n\nIn the November election, 7 in 10 Hispanic voters in Florida said they favored reducing the number of immigrants who were allowed to seek asylum in the U.S. when they arrived at the U.S. border, according to AP VoteCast. That was in line with Florida voters overall.\n\nIn 2024, Trump won not just Miami-Dade County but the central Florida counties of Seminole and Osceola, where many Venezuelans have immigrated, and made inroads in heavily Puerto Rican areas of Pennsylvania. He also flipped several South Texas border counties that were Democratic bastions for decades.\n\nWhat initially catapulted Trump’s popularity in South Florida was his stance on the socialist governments that many exiles and their families fled, along with his focus on boosting growth and reducing prices. But at a rally in Miami days before announcing his third White House bid in November 2022, Trump said that, contrary to the belief of some, Hispanics liked his vows to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\n“When I talked about the border, you know who the biggest fans of that were? (they) were the Hispanics, Latinos,” Trump said. “They knew more about the border than anybody. They knew more about it. Everybody said, ‘Oh, he’s going to hurt himself with Hispanics.’ Actually, it turned out to be the exact opposite.”\n\nBarbara Canales, a 49-year-old certified nursing assistant who lives in Hialeah, said her mother brought her as a young girl from Honduras with a visa and overstayed it. It took them many years to legalize their status and to be able to bring other family members.\n\n“That’s why I totally agree that you need to take illegal immigrants out of the United States. I’m sorry, but they should do it,” Canales said, adding that she feels most of the migrants arriving in the past few years are different. “When you come in with a visa is a totally different story.”\n\nCanales says that while the Republican president has made immigration his signature issue, previous Democratic administrations have been just as willing to enforce immigration laws and deport people who had built their lives in the U.S. Former President Barack Obamaearned the nickname “deporter in chief” from advocacy groups who opposed his use of enforcement.\n\n“It’s the reality that if you’re here breaking the rules, you have to suffer the consequences,” Canales said.\n\nMiami’s Cuban exiles are split\n\nMiami is particularly well-known for its community of Cuban exiles who originally fled the government of communist leader Fidel Castro. About two-thirds of Cuban voters in Florida supported Trump in 2024, according to AP VoteCast, while about one-third supported Harris.\n\nCubans have long prided themselves of arriving here legally through several refugee and family-based programs and have been able to get green cards easier than people from other countries, thanks to a Cold War-era law.\n\nAfter Obama in 2017 ended the “wet foot, dry foot” policy that considered any Cuban who set foot on dry land to be automatically a legal arrival, Cubans leaving for the U.S. have found more obstacles.\n\nIt did not stop many from coming.\n\nBetween 2021 and 2022, the U.S. government recorded the largest flight of Cuban exiles since the Mariel boatlift in 1980, when nearly 125,000 Cubans came to the U.S. over a six-month period.\n\n“We are all in favor of legal immigration. My parents are products of legal immigration, like many of your parents, if not you directly,” said Hialeah Mayor Esteban Bovo, a strong Trump ally, during the recent city council meeting about an ICE partnership.\n\nTrump picked up support from new Cuban immigrants such as Luis Boulart, 85, who arrived in 2015, got his citizenship in 2022 and cast his first presidential vote for Trump in 2024. Boulart recently said he trusted the president and believed the Republican party could better handle immigration, the economy, immigration and foreign policy.\n\n“I think the challenges ahead are huge. But he is capable of solving all the problems,” Boulart said.\n\nBut those policy changes have meant more recent arrivals have a tougher path to legal status than preceding generations did.\n\nJulian Padron, a 79-year-old who said he was jailed in Cuba, arrived decades ago when President Jimmy Carter negotiated with Castro the release of hundreds of political prisoners to the United States. He said he feels strongly against Trump and considers his actions anti-democratic.\n\nHe frequents Domino Park, located on Calle Ocho in Miami’s iconic Little Havana, where a lot of the players sitting at four-person tables on a recent day were supportive of Trump. Padron said he typically keeps his thoughts to himself unless he is asked for his opinion. A park employee first told an Associated Press reporter that political questions were not allowed at this park to avoid arguments. But when asked which directive forbade that, the employee said he would find out and then allowed the interviews to continue.\n\n“They are going to be detaining people,” Padron said, looking around the park. “Do they not know that people are still fleeing communism?”",

If it's the bad guys, I've got to go out with my gun and try to protect my family,\" Pagliarulo said.\n\nDispatchers confirmed the sheriff's office received a 911 call about a hostage situation with multiple dogs shot, apparently pretending to be Pagliarulo.\n\nTRUMP CABINET NOMINEES, APPOINTEES TARGETED WITH ‘VIOLENT, UNAMERICAN THREATS’\n\nThe swatter claimed someone was \"bleeding out upstairs\" and to \"please hurry and get inside,\" making the situation even more tense for both deputies responding.\n\n\"That's the thing. Not one of those things was happening,\" Pagliarulo said. \"My family was peacefully sleeping. I was working in my office. Nothing was going wrong in my house. But this guy, wherever he happened to be, was trying to get police to break down the door and possibly either kill me or scare us enough to where I would shut my mouth and not do what I do on the radio every day.\"\n\nWhile deputies defused the situation, Pagliarulo said, \"Your heart flops out of your chest.\"\n\nSWATTING ADVANCED FROM PRANK CALLS TO ‘DIGITAL TERRORISM’: EXPERT\n\nPagliarulo said he immediately texted Patel, who put out a statement about swatting the next day.\n\n\"I want to address the alarming rise in ‘Swatting’ incidents targeting media figures,\" Patel wrote in a social media post Friday. \"The FBI is aware of this dangerous trend, and my team and I are already taking action to investigate and hold those responsible accountable.\"\n\nHe added the issue isn’t about politics.\n\n\"Weaponizing law enforcement against ANY American is not only morally reprehensible but also endangers lives, including those of our officers,\" Patel wrote. \"That will not be tolerated. We are fully committed to working with local law enforcement to crack down on these crimes.\"\n\nOther conservative media figures, including podcaster Nick Sortor and host Shawn Farash, reported similar swatting incidents on the same day last week as Pagliarulo, while InfoWars host Owen Shroyer uploaded a nearly 13-minute video to Wednesday sharing that he was \"just swatted.\"\n\nA bipartisan, bicameral bill was introduced in January to strengthen penalties against those found guilty of making swatting calls, imposing prison sentences of up to 20 years for false calls resulting in serious injury or death.\n\nFEDS CHARGE 2 EUROPEANS WITH ‘SWATTING’ PLOT TARGETING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, OTHER ELECTED OFFICIALS\n\nBill cosponsor Rep.

        "full_text": "“There is a need to be able to communicate across the political spectrum. I think every university is trying to find people from the moderate to right — and even more right — in the political spectrum to help deliver messages and help protect them from unfair and problematic attacks,” said Lee Bollinger, the former president of Columbia University. “I’m seeing it more and more.”\n\nColumbia is at the center of the fight, facing a $400 million funding freeze as federal immigration agents moved to deport a former student with a green card and are combing campus looking for other non-citizen students who, the White House claims, supported Hamas during last spring’s pro-Palestinian student protests. Beilock, Dartmouth’s president, previously served as president of Barnard College, a Columbia affiliate institution and the current center of continuing protest activity at the university.\n\nThe Trump administration on Wednesday froze $175 million in funding to the University of Pennsylvania over its transgender athlete policies. Cornell and Yale are under investigation for allegedly prioritizing doctoral applicants from underrepresented backgrounds. And the administration has launched probes into alleged antisemitism at Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Princeton and Yale.\n\nDartmouth — the smallest Ivy League college, tucked away in rural New Hampshire and known for being less progressive than many of its peers — is the only school in the conference that appears to so far have escaped the administration’s wrath.\n\n“We’ve done a good job in the past of permitting free expression and respecting others’ voices,” said Phil Hanlon, who served as Dartmouth’s president before Beilock. “We’ve worked hard at that over many decades.”\n\nRaymer’s history on immigration could be where he faces the greatest opposition on campus, as his hiring appears to prioritize the political realities over universities’ long-held values. Universities have faced increasing pressure from students and advocates to answer questions about how they will protect students amid the president’s immigration crackdown, as Trump has changed policy to allow immigration enforcement at schools and fears percolate about data protection for undocumented students, as well those who have parents living in the country illegally.\n\n“This general counsel and his views on birthright citizenship are horrifying … and just seeing that advertised at their university, it might make students more fearful,” said Elaine Maimon, a former university administrator, adding that universities are being targeted and must seek a wide range of advice to protect their students. “If I was sitting there making the decision, I’d have to weigh whether the strategic use of his advice to protect the student was worth upsetting them.”\n\nDartmouth said last month it is not changing any of its immigration policies in response to the Trump administration’s actions, but that a group of university leaders is meeting every week to review policy and how it might affect campus, according to New Hampshire Public Radio. The college has encouraged students to reach out to their “dean or supervisor” with questions, or to seek additional support in the Office of Visa and Immigration Services (which has long been overseen by the college’s top lawyer). Dartmouth has also recently encouraged immigrant and international students to ensure they’re carrying proper documentation while traveling given increased enforcement and anticipated travel restrictions, as even some people with legal status have been deported or detained in recent weeks.\n\nRaymer, a Dartmouth graduate, authored a piece published in the Federalist in January, arguing that “Trump is right about birthright citizenship” and that children born to undocumented immigrants are not entitled to citizenship under the 14th Amendment. The president tried to end birthright citizenship on his first day in office, despite broad legal consensus that the Constitution grants American citizenship to nearly everyone born on U.S. soil. He was quickly blocked in the courts.\n\nDartmouth spokesperson Jana Barnello said Raymer brings “extensive legal expertise, sound judgement” and a “deep personal commitment to his alma mater.” She added that he is eager to “strengthen relationships” across the college and ensure Dartmouth remains a place of “academic excellence, ideological diversity, and exploration.” As general counsel, she said he will provide guidance and support Dartmouth’s legal strategy under the direction of the president, but that he “does not set policy.”\n\n“Dartmouth’s approach to legal matters has always been consistent, reflecting the institution’s commitment to its academic mission and its responsibilities under the law,” the spokesperson said.\n\nAnd on birthright citizenship, Barnello said Raymer’s opinion piece presented a “scholarly legal argument” on a widely discussed topic, adding that it is “separate from Matt Raymer’s responsibilities as Dartmouth’s General Counsel. Like all its senior leaders, Dartmouth has full confidence in Matt’s ability to serve in this role based on his qualifications and expertise, without regard to any personal political beliefs.”\n\nRaymer’s hire appears to be part of an effort to keep Dartmouth out of the path of destruction.\n\nHolden Thorp, a former chancellor at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, said it doesn’t surprise him that someone “sharp” like Beilock would have made this hire, adding that public universities have long played this game at the state level, bringing in Republican operatives to work at a university to help navigate changing political leadership.\n\n“It makes perfect sense: every university is clearly going to have to work things out with the administration on a variety of matters — whether it’s funding or immigration matters with their students, or the Dear Colleague letter,” Thorp said. “All of this stuff is getting litigated in the courts, and then it’s playing out in Congress in terms of them writing the budget.”",

        "full_text": "BETA\n\nTHIS IS A BETA EXPERIENCE. OPT-OUT&nbspHERE\n\nTrump Signs Executive Order To ‘Eliminate’ Education Department—Here’s What That Means For Student Loans\n\nMar 20, 2025,05:32pm EDT\n\nTopline\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday which he said will “eliminate” the Department of Education, though the department will still keep some functions, including Title I and student loans, under federal control, as Trump expressed hope Congress would officially shutter the department.\n\nKey Facts\n\nTrump said his administration wants to shut down the Department of Education “as quickly as possible,” adding “we want to return our students to the states,” though it would ultimately take Congressional approval to formally close the department.\n\nThe order is designed to give states control over education, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier Thursday, though the federal government will still be responsible for administering Title I funding, Pell grants, student loans, special education funding and enforcement of civil rights laws, among other “critical functions.”\n\nTrump, for weeks, has been expected to sign an order to deconstruct the agency Republicans have long claimed is a product of bureaucratic bloat.\n\nThe White House claimed in a fact sheet on the forthcoming executive order “there has been virtually no measurable improvement in student achievement” since the Education Department was created in 1979, arguing it has failed to improve standardized test scores and proficiency in math and reading.\n\nThe order is only one step in dismantling the department, and firings at the agency have already prompted a lawsuit from Democratic state attorneys general.\n\nContra\n\nThe total elimination of the Education Department would require approval from Congress, which is controlled by Republicans. However, if a supermajority is needed in the Senate, at least seven Democrats would need to vote in favor of eliminating the department. Prior to signing the executive order, Trump said he hopes Democrats “will be voting for” the department’s elimination.\n\nKey Background\n\nTrump has long-promised to effectively shut down the agency, calling for it to be “closed immediately” last month and for Education Secretary Linda McMahon to “put herself out of a job.” His administration has already taken steps to slash the agency’s workforce, announcing earlier this month it would eliminate half of the 4,000 positions. The department was established by statute under President Jimmy Carter in 1979. Federal dollars now account for about 10% of public school funding.\n\nFurther Reading\n\n21 Democratic Attorneys General Sue Trump Administration Over Education Department Cuts (Forbes)\n\nTrump Plans To Sign Executive Order Today Dismantling Education Department (Forbes)\n\nJoin The Conversation\n\nOne Community.

        "full_text": "HELSINKI (AP) — Finland is the happiest country in the world for the eighth year in a row, according to the World Happiness Report 2025 published Thursday.\n\nOther Nordic countries are also once again at the top of the happiness rankings in the annual report published by the Wellbeing Research Centre at the University of Oxford. Besides Finland, Denmark, Iceland and Sweden remain the top four and in the same order.\n\nAino Virolainen, a digital commerce director, has lived abroad but always wants to return home to Finland.\n\n“This is where I always want to come back to and where I want to, you know, grow my kids and grow old myself,” Virolainen said Thursday. “And I think it’s because, you know, the peace and the quietness and the trustworthiness. You know, how we speak directly and the nature, of course. It’s clean and the air is fresh and what’s there not to love?”\n\nCountry rankings were based on answers people give when asked to rate their own lives. The study was done in partnership with the analytics firm Gallup and the U.N. Sustainable Development Solutions Network.\n\n“Happiness isn’t just about wealth or growth — it’s about trust, connection and knowing people have your back,” said Jon Clifton, the CEO of Gallup. “If we want stronger communities and economies, we must invest in what truly matters: each other.”\n\nSharing meals and having somebody to count on\n\nResearchers say that beyond health and wealth, some factors that influence happiness sound deceptively simple: sharing meals with others, having somebody to count on for social support, and household size. In Mexico and Europe, for example, a household size of four to five people predicts the highest levels of happiness, the study said.\n\nBelieving in the kindness of others is also much more closely tied to happiness than previously thought, according to the latest findings.\n\nAs an example, the report suggests that people who believe that others are willing to return their lost wallet is a strong predictor of the overall happiness of a population.\n\nNordic nations rank among the top places for expected and actual return of lost wallets, the study found.\n\nAlexandra Peth, a managing director, said Finnish culture prioritizes trust and connection.\n\n“People trust each other in Finland and I think on many levels in the society, we try to support each other,” Peth said. “So I think the system makes it kind of that you can trust it somehow.”\n\nOverall, researchers said that global evidence on the perceived and actual return of lost wallets shows that people are much too pessimistic about the kindness of their communities compared to reality — actual rates of wallet return are around twice as high as people expect.\n\nThe U.S. falls to its lowest-ever position in the happiness ranking\n\nWhile European countries dominate the top 20 in the ranking, there were some exceptions. Despite the war with Hamas, Israel came in at eighth. Costa Rica and Mexico entered the top 10 for the first time, ranking at sixth and 10th respectively.\n\nWhen it comes to decreasing happiness — or growing unhappiness — the United States has dropped to its lowest-ever position at 24, having previously peaked at 11th place in 2012. The report states that the number of people dining alone in the United States has increased 53% over the past two decades.\n\nThe United Kingdom, at position 23, is reporting its lowest average life evaluation since the 2017 report.\n\nAfghanistan is again ranked as the unhappiest country in the world, with Afghan women saying their lives are especially difficult.\n\nSierra Leone in western Africa is the second unhappiest, followed by Lebanon, ranking third from the bottom.\n\nAlmost one-fifth of young adults globally have no social support\n\nIn a concerning development, the study said that 19% of young adults across the world reported in 2023 that they have no one they could count on for social support. That is a 39% increase compared to 2006.\n\nAll countries are ranked according to their self-assessed life evaluations averaged over 2022 to 2024.\n\nExperts in economics, psychology, sociology and beyond then seek to explain the variations across countries and over time using factors such as gross domestic product per capita, healthy life expectancy, having someone to count on, a sense of freedom, generosity and perceptions of corruption.\n\nJouni Purhonen, a Helsinki resident, called Finns “really calm.”\n\n“So we have the time to think about things like live our life really peacefully and I guess easily, if you will,” Purhonen said.\n\n___\n\nKirsten Grieshaber reported from Berlin.",

        "full_text": "NEW YORK (AP) — 23andMe has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and its co-founder and CEO has resigned as the struggling genetic testing company continues its push to cut costs.\n\nSan Francisco-based 23andMe announced on Sunday that it will look to sell “substantially all of its assets” through a court-approved reorganization plan.\n\nAnne Wojcicki, who co-founded 23andMe nearly two decades ago, is also stepping down as CEO effective immediately, the company said — but will remain on the 23andMe board. Her resignation comes just weeks after a board committee rejected a nonbinding acquisition proposal from Wojcicki, who has been trying to take the company private.\n\nAnd Wojcicki intends to still bid on 23andMe as the company pursues a sale through the bankruptcy process. In a statement on social media, Wojcicki said that she resigned as CEO to be “in the best position” as an independent bidder.\n\n“There is no doubt that the challenges faced by 23andMe through an evolving business model have been real, but my belief in the company and its future is unwavering,” she later added.\n\n23andMe has faced an uncertain future for some time. Beyond battles to go private, the company struggled to find a profitable business model since going public in 2021. Privacy concerns related to customers’ genetic information have also emerged, notably spanning from a 2023 data breach — along with questions around what new ownership could mean for users’ data.\n\nHere’s what to know.\n\n23andMe’s bankruptcy follows months of turmoil\n\n23andMe was founded in 2006, with a promise to revolutionize the future of genetics and health care. The company became known for its saliva-based DNA testing kits — purchased by millions of customers eager to learn more about their ancestry — and later dived further into health research and drug development.\n\nBut recent years have been far from smooth sailing for 23andMe. And Sunday’s voluntary bankruptcy filing caps months of turmoil.\n\nLast September, all of its independent directors resigned in a rare move following acquisition negotiations with Wojcicki.\n\nThe company then announced in November that it would lay off 40% of its workforce, or more than 200 employees, and discontinue its therapeutics division. And in January, the board’s special committee said it was exploring strategic alternatives, including a possible sale.\n\nShares of 23andMe Holding Co. have shed nearly all their value since last spring — and plunged even farther after Sunday’s bankruptcy filing, trading at under $1 as of midday Monday.\n\nIn recent securities filings, 23andMe continued to warn about its “ability to continue as a going concern” — which is accounting-speak for having the resources needed to operate and stay in business.\n\nSunday’s Chapter 11 filing from 23andMe reported total debts of more than $214.7 million as of the end of last year. Assets, meanwhile, amounted to over $277.4 million.\n\nWhat does Chapter 11 mean for the company?\n\n23andMe says that filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection will help facilitate a sale of the company, meaning that it’s seeking new ownership.\n\nIn a statement Sunday, Board Chair Mark Jensen said that this court-supervised process was “the best path forward.” He added they also expect it to help 23andMe’s efforts to cut costs as well as resolve legal and leasehold liabilities.\n\n23andMe is looking to pull back from its real estate footprint. Among motions filed on Sunday, the company is seeking court approval to reject lease contracts in San Francisco and Sunnyvale, California, for example, in efforts to help cut down on expenses.\n\nOtherwise, 23andMe says it plans to continue operating. The company says it’s received $35 million in debtor-in-possession financing from JMB Capital Partners to help support its business throughout the bankruptcy process.\n\nI’m a 23andMe customer. Is my genetic data safe?\n\n23andMe says its bankruptcy filing won’t change the way it stores or protects data. Jensen, the board chair, said Sunday that 23andMe is “committed to continuing to safeguard customer data” and that data privacy will be “an important consideration” in any future sale.\n\nJohn Bringardner of Debtwire notes that any new buyer of 23andMe will have to comply with regulatory approvals that ensure “customer data won’t end up in unscrupulous hands.”\n\nStill, who will end up owning 23andMe down the road is unknown. And experts note that risks remain.\n\n“Personal data collected by 23andme has always been at risk,” Bringardner wrote in emailed commentary on Monday — pointing particularly to a 2023 data breach that compromised ancestral information for nearly 7 million 23andMe customers. He adds that litigation spanning from the aftermath of this breach helped drive up liabilities that eventually contributed to the current bankruptcy filing.\n\nLast year, 23andMe agreed to pay $30 million in cash to settle a class-action lawsuit accusing the company of failing to protect customers whose personal information was exposed in this breach. On Sunday, the company said that it plans to use bankruptcy proceedings to “resolve all outstanding legal liabilities” stemming from the October 2023 incident.\n\nBeyond this data breach, uncertainty about the company’s future overall has also led some to recently urge 23andMe customers to delete their data.\n\nOn Friday, days before 23andMe’s bankruptcy filing, California Attorney General Rob Bonta issued an urgent alert reminding 23andMe customers of their legal rights under state law — and called on them to consider deleting and destroying any genetic data held by the company. Bonta’s office pointed to 23andMe’s ongoing financial distress and “trove of sensitive consumer data” the company has amassed.\n\n______\n\nAP Health Writer Tom Murphy contributed to this report from Indianapolis."

        "full_text": "Across the United States, recent political protests have taken the form of violence against the car company Tesla – whose CEO Elon Musk is advising the Trump administration in its efforts to radically downsize the federal government.\n\nPeople have vandalized Tesla charging stations and dealerships, fired bullets into one Oregon showroom, and set cars ablaze this week at a Las Vegas Tesla collision center.\n\nThese property attacks are part of a broader increase in politically or ideologically motivated violence. Prominent examples, against a backdrop high overall gun violence in America, range from the killing of a health insurance executive to an attempted assassination of then-candidate Donald Trump. Then there was also the mowing down of pedestrians in New Orleans by a truck driven by a radicalized former American soldier.\n\nWhy We Wrote This\n\nWide-ranging homegrown threats of political and extremist violence are challenging law enforcement to change how it operates. Some experts say cooperation among agencies and community trust are essential to solving the problem.\n\nWhile relatively rare, the attacks defy easy categories. Extremist violence runs from organized groups to lone attackers and from right-wing or white supremacist ideologies to leftist confrontations with police and the recent Tesla vandalism.\n\nTo Brian Levin, founder of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, this means the threat can be characterized as “everything, everywhere, all at once.”\n\nIn fact, in the search for solutions, some public safety experts say it’s essential to remember that extreme violence is not always ideologically motivated. And the best responses to the varied threats often include general ones, such as community vigilance and better security for public events.\n\n“What it means in practical terms is that only shared solutions can work,” says John Horgan, the Violent Extremism Research Group director at Georgia State University in Atlanta. “While the FBI will be responsible for managing investigations, community leaders, teachers, and others all have their roles to play in not just educating people about the dangers of terrorism but in showing us what we can do to safeguard our communities against these threats.”\n\nA selective approach to justice?\n\nPresident Trump won office in part on promises of law and order. His focus is on curbing illegal immigration, and he has suggested treating the Tesla attacks as domestic terrorism.\n\nBut there are also signs of a selective approach to justice, including retribution against perceived enemies and laxity on some crimes. One of the president’s first acts after inauguration was to pardon his own supporters convicted of crimes in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nJason Riddle was a rare one who didn’t accept that pardon.\n\nOn the day of the attack, the New Hampshire man posed inside the Capitol, jubilantly holding up a stolen bottle of wine as he tried to stop the lawful certification of President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. Today, he says the pardons undermine the rule of law.\n\n“This moment feels scary and dangerous,” says Mr. Riddle, a former U.S. postal worker.\n\nThe apparent injection of partisanship into who will face legal accountability is troubling, says former FBI counterterrorism analyst Matthew Levitt, now an analyst at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy. It’s “why we’re in a situation right now where there’s concern about undermining ... norms of law enforcement and the rule of law.”\n\nThis comes as homegrown terrorism has been on the rise. Between 2013 and 2021, the number of domestic terrorism-related cases more than tripled, with three-fourths of the total 444 cases fueled by racial or cultural hatred, according to congressional testimony by extremism expert Cynthia Miller-Idriss. But starting this decade, deaths from hard-left attacks have begun rising. Islamist terrorism also remains a significant extremism threat in the U.S.\n\nFusing ideology and personal pain\n\nFor those who perpetrate political violence, their story can often be a blurry fusion of ideology and personal pain.\n\nLuigi Mangione, the 26-year-old charged with murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, struggled with chronic back pain, according to news reports. Whether that might have affected his alleged is unclear. What is certain is that Mr. Mangione had been deeply critical of the U.S. health insurance system – a view shared by many Americans, more than half of whom rate it as “fair” or “poor,” according to a recent Gallup pool.\n\nEarly on New Year’s Day, Shamsud-Din Jabbar used a truck to kill 14 pedestrians and injure 30 others out celebrating on Bourbon Street in New Orleans.\n\nMr. Jabbar, who died during the attack, carried an Islamic State (ISIS) flag in his truck and appeared to be self-radicalized. A Texas-born information technology specialist, former soldier, and real estate agent, he had also been through multiple divorces and financial challenges.\n\nThe search for shared solutions\n\nAmericans have begun to adapt to evolving threats by discussing radicalization and mobilization toward violence in new ways.\n\nTerrorism has traditionally been defined as an act of public violence fueled or influenced by some ideology. But today, counterterror experts increasingly use phrases like “extreme violence” or “targeted violence.” They emphasize how the path from ideation to violence can be similar, whether ideology is involved or not. Professor Horgan sees this as a helpful shift.\n\n“Just looking at discrete, distinct types of violence may obscure the fact that there are shared solutions open to us,” he says.\n\nIndeed, communities are addressing the uptick in vehicle ramming attacks by installing physical barriers when and where needed. Gina Ligon, director of the National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology, and Education Center at the University of Nebraska Omaha, says these can include “beautiful security” such as planters with trees that “can serve the purpose of bollards but also not make people feel like they’re living in a security state.”\n\nSpecial teams that assess how behavior can flag violence have also become common in regional and local governments. As part of his work at Georgia State, Professor Horgan holds regular counterterrorism sessions with police departments.\n\nPolice officers, he says, often try to understand what kinds of ideas drive terrorists. Instead, he focuses on “behavioral leakage,” or clues about violent intent frequently exhibited by lone actors. One key to success: Authorities must assure informants that they are protected from prosecution. Fear of negative police attention is a major reason many terror plots go unreported.\n\nMost people who commit political violence leave missed clues. “The notion that we don’t see terrorism coming is complete nonsense,” says Professor Horgan.\n\nOne of the most pernicious forms of homegrown mass violence is school shootings. While legal terms and codes often render them “mass shootings” instead of terrorist acts, which are traditionally considered violence intended to sway governments, there has been a growing push to have lethal school violence like mass shootings labeled “domestic terrorism.”\n\nLast year, 59 gun deaths occurred on U.S. school grounds, according to data from the group Everytown. So far this year, there have been 10 such deaths.\n\nMost often, such attacks involve school shooters who had at least one social media account, had posted disturbing content of guns and threatening messages online, and had at least one reported adverse childhood experience, including being bullied in person or online, according to the Journal of Pediatric Health Care.\n\nJust as schools are trying to identify and address the causes of school violence, how the FBI defines threats and focuses resources in the broader population will be a key to confronting increasingly complex homegrown dangers.\n\nFighting extremism at home\n\nPresident Trump expanded federal anti-extremism programs in 2019 after a resurgence of attacks linked to ISIS, which the U.S. government designates as a terrorist group. Two years later, President Biden ramped up additional anti-extremism efforts after the Jan. 6 Capitol riots. Those efforts have included counterterrorism task forces and programs that engage school principals and social workers to help pinpoint and address potential threats.\n\nMr. Riddle, who served three months in prison for his role in the Jan. 6 riots, credits the state of New Hampshire for helping him. After an arrest for impaired driving, he says in an interview, the court ordered a breath alcohol meter installed on his car’s ignition.\n\nThanks to that requirement, he says, he achieved enough mental clarity to recognize that his fervor leading up to Jan. 6 was misguided. He is now concerned that some pardoned rioters still hold the view, endorsed and promoted by Mr. Trump, that the 2020 election was stolen. No court cases attempting to prove that allegation have succeeded.\n\nJonathan Lewis, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, says that while the motivations may be blurry and diverse – including global ideologies of terrorism – the most numerous risks of violence against the public area are homegrown.\n\n“Right now, with the domestic threat, there’s an unwillingness to reckon with the fact that the call is coming from inside the house,” he says."

        "full_text": "MADISON, Wis. — President Donald Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk are going all-in on flipping control of Wisconsin’s top court, with Trump endorsing the conservative in the race and Musk’s PAC hunting for votes by offering state residents cash for their contact details.\n\nThe burst of support comes as Trump faces his first test with swing-state voters in the April 1 election since winning a second term in November. The court is expected to decide the future of abortion in the state and could redraw a congressional map that has given Republicans six of the state’s eight seats.\n\nTrump on Friday said on his Truth Social platform that he was backing Brad Schimel, a Waukesha County judge and former Republican state attorney general who is seeking a seat on Wisconsin’s high court. He excoriated the liberal in the race, Dane County Judge Susan Crawford, writing “if she wins, the Movement to restore our Nation will bypass Wisconsin.”\n\nGroups affiliated with Musk have poured more than $13 million into Wisconsin in recent weeks in what is already the most expensive court race in U.S. history. Musk, ranked by Forbes as the world’s richest person, has put a spotlight on the race as he assists Trump with firing government workers and shuttering federal agencies through his U.S. DOGE Service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk dialed up his focus on Wisconsin on Thursday when his America PAC offered registered voters in the state $100 if they provided contact information and signed a petition opposing activist judges. The PAC also offered them $100 for each registered Wisconsin voter they referred to sign the petition — but the fine print of the offer said the PAC would determine whom to pay and noted payments may not be made for months.\n\nThe payment-for-data arrangement will give Musk’s team an easy way to reach a pool of voters it can bombard with messages urging them to support Schimel in the election. Turnout in Wisconsin court elections is much lower than in presidential elections, and liberals have had a large turnout advantage in recent court races. Political observers for both sides say Schimel’s best chance of success is to get voters who backed Trump in November to the polls.\n\nOn Saturday, Musk hosted Schimel on an audio live stream on X, the social media site owned by Musk. “If you look at the early voting data so far, Democrats are winning, which is not good,” Musk said.\n\nCrawford’s campaign called Trump and Musk’s support unsurprising and contended Schimel would do their bidding. Crawford and her allies for weeks have decried Musk’s role in the race, with the state Democratic Party holding town-hall-style meetings about the race dubbed “The People v. Musk.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Schimel has spent his entire career on bent knee to right-wing special interests,” Crawford spokesman Derrick Honeyman said in a statement. “We assumed he had this endorsement locked up months ago.”\n\nCandidates and independent groups have spent $76 million on the race so far, according to a tally by news site Wispolitics.com. That beats the national record for a court race set two years ago, when liberals gained control of Wisconsin’s top court.\n\nOn the audio live stream, Musk said he got involved in the race because the court’s liberal 4-3 majority may eventually redraw the state’s congressional districts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It could cause the House to switch to Democrat if that redrawing takes place, and then we wouldn’t be able to get through the changes that the American people want,” Musk said.\n\nThere is no pending lawsuit over Wisconsin’s congressional districts, but liberal groups may file one if the court keeps its ideological makeup. Two years ago, liberal voters filed a lawsuit over state legislative districts after the liberals won a majority of the court, and the justices soon struck down maps that had given Republicans large majorities in the state legislature. Under new maps, Democrats made large gains last year.\n\nCrawford met by video in January with a liberal group that billed the race as a chance to redraw the state’s House districts. Crawford has said she didn’t discuss redistricting during the call, but Schimel and Republicans have said the meeting shows what’s at stake if she wins.\n\nMusk and Schimel’s audio live stream included some technical glitches and featured Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin), who contended the court’s liberals could reverse the state’s voter ID law and its restrictions on collective bargaining for most public workers in the state.\n\nThe group did not discuss the two biggest cases on the court’s docket, which together will determine whether abortion will remain legal in the state. The cases are expected to be decided before August when a new justice is sworn in, but they will shape what kind of future abortion litigation could come to the high court. Crawford supports abortion rights; Schimel has long opposed abortion but during the campaign has said he would respect the will of voters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWisconsin clinics stopped offering abortions in 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and ended that ruling’s guarantee of access to abortion. They feared an 1849 state law would prevent them from providing abortions, but they resumed offering them in 2023 after a lower court ruled the law did not apply to them.\n\nThe state Supreme Court is now considering that case along with one that asks whether the state constitution guarantees a right to abortion. Abortion is now allowed for up to 20 weeks in the state.\n\nSchimel, Musk and Johnson also did not mention that Musk’s electric car company, Tesla, sued the state in January after Wisconsin officials barred it from opening dealerships because of a state law that bars car manufacturers from owning dealerships. That case could eventually make it to the state Supreme Court.\n\nMusk called the race important but made light of its timing.\n\n“Such a fateful election,” he said, “but it’s on April Fools’ Day.”"

        "full_text": "Advocacy and labor groups on Monday filed a lawsuit to stop President Trump’s executive order to dismantle the Department of Education, saying the move is unconstitutional and will hurt students.\n\nThe National Education Association; the NAACP; the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Maryland Council 3; and a group of public school parents are asking a federal judge to “immediately halt” the administration’s attempt to shutter the department, they said in a statement.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Mr. Trump overstepped his constitutional authority and violated the Administrative Procedure Act, asserting that the Education Department was created by Congress and cannot be dismantled by a president.\n\n“Taken together, defendants’ steps since January 20, 2025, constitute a de facto dismantling of the Department by executive fiat …” the complaint states. “But the Constitution gives power over ‘the establishment of offices [and] the determination of functions and jurisdiction’ to Congress — not the President or any officer working under him.’ Because it is a Congressionally-created federal agency, legally eliminating the Department of Education, or its constituent offices, or transferring them to other federal agencies requires Congressional approval.”\n\nMr. Trump does not have the authority to close a Cabinet-level department. That would require a 60-vote majority in the Senate, which he is unlikely to achieve given the GOP’s slim control of the upper chamber. Much of the Education Department’s primary responsibilities, such as administering student loans and providing grants to students with disabilities, have been codified by Congress.\n\n“The NEA and NAACP have done nothing to advance the educational outcomes of America’s students and the latest NAEP scores prove that. Instead of playing politics with baseless lawsuits, these groups should ditch the courtroom and work with the Trump administration and states on improving the classroom,” White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement.\n\nSEE ALSO: Federal judge rules DOGE broke privacy rules in accessing Education Department files\n\nThe lawsuit comes days after Mr. Trump signed an executive order directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to take all steps within her authority to slash the agency’s workforce and limit its scope.\n\nMr. Trump said he would shift the Education Department’s student loan program to the Small Business Administration and programs for students with disabilities and nutrition programs to the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nEarlier this month, the department announced it had laid off more than 1,300 employees, which prompted a lawsuit from 21 Democratic state attorneys general who say the firings impede the agency’s ability to carry out its main responsibilities.\n\nDismantling the department has long been a goal for Republicans since it was created by President Jimmy Carter in 1979. President Ronald Reagan had tried to cut it after taking office but was unsuccessful. Conservative ire for the department reached new heights under President Joseph R. Biden after it began forgiving student loans, bungled the rollout of new financial aid forms and expanded rules to accommodate transgender students in sports."

        "full_text": "President Donald Trump said Monday that the U.S. will impose 25% tariffs on countries that buy oil and gas from Venezuela, as he seeks to increase pressure on President Nicolas Maduro and China.\n\nCountries that buy oil and gas from Venezuela will face tariffs on any trade they have with the U.S., Trump said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social. The tariffs take effect on April 2, the president said.\n\n\"If they buy their oil from Venezuela, they have to pay a 25% tariff to do business with the United States —that's on top of existing tariffs,\" Trump said during a press conference at the White House.\n\nVenezuela exported about 660,000 barrels per day in 2024, according to data from Kpler. China was the largest destination for the South American nation's crude exports, purchasing 270,000 bpd last year.\n\n\"This announcement by the Trump administration appears to be one more action targeting China,\" Matt Smith, an oil analyst at Kpler, told CNBC.\n\nBrent crude futures rose 61 cents, or 0.85%, to $72.77 a barrel by 1:15 p.m. ET. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was up 59 cents, or 0.86%, at $68.87.\n\n\"We expect oil prices to go higher in light of this news and may rise further if Trump follows through with this proclamation,\" analyst Leo Mariani at Roth told clients in a note.\n\nThe Treasury Department on Monday also extended Chevron's license to produce oil in Venezuela until May 27. Trump said in late February that he would reverse a Biden administration decision which allowed Chevron to restart oil production in the country. Treasury had previously given the oil major until April 3 to wind down its operations in Venezuela.\n\nChevron CEO Mike Wirth lobbied Trump administration officials to extend the license during meetings last week, people familiar with the discussions told The Wall Street Journal. Chevron does business in Venezuela through a partnership with its national oil company Petróleos de Venezuela. The oil major has stakes in five onshore and offshore projects in western and eastern Venezuela.\n\nThe tariffs are intended to make it more difficult for China to gain a foothold in Venezuela's oil industry while bolstering Chevron and ensuring oil flows to the U.S., people familiar with the matter told the Journal last week.\n\nTrump invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act on March 15 in response to what the president claims is an invasion by Tren de Aragua. The president said its members are conducting \"irregular warfare\" against the U.S. at the direction of Maduro.\n\nFederal District Court Judge James Boasberg has blocked Trump's plan to deport alleged members of Tren de Aragua using the Alien Enemies Act. Trump has called for Boasberg's impeachment, sparking fears among some legal experts that the U.S. is facing a constitutional crisis. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts has rebuked Trump's calls for Boasberg to be removed.\n\nGet Your Ticket to Pro LIVE\n\nJoin us at the New York Stock Exchange!\n\nUncertain markets?

        "full_text": "I, however, knew two hours before the first bombs exploded that the attack might be coming. The reason I knew this is that Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, had texted me the war plan at 11:44 a.m. The plan included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing.\n\nThis is going to require some explaining.\n\nThis article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.\n\nThe story technically begins shortly after the Hamas invasion of southern Israel, in October 2023. The Houthis—an Iran-backed terrorist organization whose motto is “God is great, death to America, death to Israel, curse on the Jews, victory to Islam”—soon launched attacks on Israel and on international shipping, creating havoc for global trade. Throughout 2024, the Biden administration was ineffective in countering these Houthi attacks; the incoming Trump administration promised a tougher response.\n\nThis is where Pete Hegseth and I come in.\n\nOn Tuesday, March 11, I received a connection request on Signal from a user identified as Michael Waltz. Signal is an open-source encrypted messaging service popular with journalists and others who seek more privacy than other text-messaging services are capable of delivering. I assumed that the Michael Waltz in question was President Donald Trump’s national security adviser. I did not assume, however, that the request was from the actual Michael Waltz. I have met him in the past, and though I didn’t find it particularly strange that he might be reaching out to me, I did think it somewhat unusual, given the Trump administration’s contentious relationship with journalists—and Trump’s periodic fixation on me specifically. It immediately crossed my mind that someone could be masquerading as Waltz in order to somehow entrap me. It is not at all uncommon these days for nefarious actors to try to induce journalists to share information that could be used against them.\n\nI accepted the connection request, hoping that this was the actual national security adviser, and that he wanted to chat about Ukraine, or Iran, or some other important matter.\n\nTwo days later—Thursday—at 4:28 p.m., I received a notice that I was to be included in a Signal chat group. It was called the “Houthi PC small group.”\n\nA message to the group, from “Michael Waltz,” read as follows: “Team – establishing a principles [sic] group for coordination on Houthis, particularly for over the next 72 hours. My deputy Alex Wong is pulling together a tiger team at deputies/agency Chief of Staff level following up from the meeting in the Sit Room this morning for action items and will be sending that out later this evening.”\n\nThe message continued, “Pls provide the best staff POC from your team for us to coordinate with over the next couple days and over the weekend. Thx.”\n\nThe term principals committee generally refers to a group of the senior-most national-security officials, including the secretaries of defense, state, and the treasury, as well as the director of the CIA. It should go without saying—but I’ll say it anyway—that I have never been invited to a White House principals-committee meeting, and that, in my many years of reporting on national-security matters, I had never heard of one being convened over a commercial messaging app.\n\nOne minute later, a person identified only as “MAR”—the secretary of state is Marco Antonio Rubio—wrote, “Mike Needham for State,” apparently designating the current counselor of the State Department as his representative. At that same moment, a Signal user identified as “JD Vance” wrote, “Andy baker for VP.” One minute after that, “TG” (presumably Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, or someone masquerading as her) wrote, “Joe Kent for DNI.” Nine minutes later, “Scott B”—apparently Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, or someone spoofing his identity, wrote, “Dan Katz for Treasury.” At 4:53 p.m., a user called “Pete Hegseth” wrote, “Dan Caldwell for DoD.” And at 6:34 p.m., “Brian” wrote “Brian McCormack for NSC.” One more person responded: “John Ratcliffe” wrote at 5:24 p.m. with the name of a CIA official to be included in the group. I am not publishing that name, because that person is an active intelligence officer.\n\nThe principals had apparently assembled. In all, 18 individuals were listed as members of this group, including various National Security Council officials; Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s Middle East and Ukraine negotiator; Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff; and someone identified only as “S M,” which I took to stand for Stephen Miller. I appeared on my own screen only as “JG.”\n\nThat was the end of the Thursday text chain.\n\nAfter receiving the Waltz text related to the “Houthi PC small group,” I consulted a number of colleagues. We discussed the possibility that these texts were part of a disinformation campaign, initiated by either a foreign intelligence service or, more likely, a media-gadfly organization, the sort of group that attempts to place journalists in embarrassing positions, and sometimes succeeds. I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans. I also could not believe that the national security adviser to the president would be so reckless as to include the editor in chief of The Atlantic in such discussions with senior U.S. officials, up to and including the vice president.\n\nThe next day, things got even stranger.\n\nAt 8:05 a.m. on Friday, March 14, “Michael Waltz” texted the group: “Team, you should have a statement of conclusions with taskings per the Presidents guidance this morning in your high side inboxes.” (High side, in government parlance, refers to classified computer and communications systems.) “State and DOD, we developed suggested notification lists for regional Allies and partners. Joint Staff is sending this am a more specific sequence of events in the coming days and we will work w DOD to ensure COS, OVP and POTUS are briefed.”\n\nAt this point, a fascinating policy discussion commenced. The account labeled “JD Vance” responded at 8:16: “Team, I am out for the day doing an economic event in Michigan. But I think we are making a mistake.” (Vance was indeed in Michigan that day.) The Vance account goes on to state, “3 percent of US trade runs through the suez. 40 percent of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn’t understand this or why it’s necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message.”\n\nThe Vance account then goes on to make a noteworthy statement, considering that the vice president has not deviated publicly from Trump’s position on virtually any issue. “I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”\n\nA person identified in Signal as “Joe Kent” (Trump’s nominee to run the National Counterterrorism Center is named Joe Kent) wrote at 8:22, “There is nothing time sensitive driving the time line. We’ll have the exact same options in a month.”\n\nThen, at 8:26 a.m., a message landed in my Signal app from the user “John Ratcliffe.” The message contained information that might be interpreted as related to actual and current intelligence operations.\n\nAt 8:27, a message arrived from the “Pete Hegseth” account. “VP: I understand your concerns – and fully support you raising w/ POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc). I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what – nobody knows who the Houthis are – which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.”\n\nThe Hegseth message goes on to state, “Waiting a few weeks or a month does not fundamentally change the calculus. 2 immediate risks on waiting: 1) this leaks, and we look indecisive; 2) Israel takes an action first – or Gaza cease fire falls apart – and we don’t get to start this on our own terms. We can manage both. We are prepared to execute, and if I had final go or no go vote, I believe we should. This [is] not about the Houthis. I see it as two things: 1) Restoring Freedom of Navigation, a core national interest; and 2) Reestablish deterrence, which Biden cratered. But, we can easily pause. And if we do, I will do all we can to enforce 100% OPSEC”—operations security. “I welcome other thoughts.”\n\nA few minutes later, the “Michael Waltz” account posted a lengthy note about trade figures, and the limited capabilities of European navies. “Whether it’s now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes. Per the president’s request we are working with DOD and State to determine how to compile the cost associated and levy them on the Europeans.”\n\nThe account identified as “JD Vance” addressed a message at 8:45 to @Pete Hegseth: “if you think we should do it let’s go. I just hate bailing Europe out again.” (The administration has argued that America’s European allies benefit economically from the U.S. Navy’s protection of international shipping lanes.)\n\nThe user identified as Hegseth responded three minutes later: “VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC. But Mike is correct, we are the only ones on the planet (on our side of the ledger) who can do this. Nobody else even close. Question is timing. I feel like now is as good a time as any, given POTUS directive to reopen shipping lanes. I think we should go; but POTUS still retains 24 hours of decision space.”\n\nAt this point, the previously silent “S M” joined the conversation. “As I heard it, the president was clear: green light, but we soon make clear to Egypt and Europe what we expect in return. We also need to figure out how to enforce such a requirement. EG, if Europe doesn’t remunerate, then what? If the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return.”\n\nThat message from “S M”—presumably President Trump’s confidant Stephen Miller, the deputy White House chief of staff, or someone playing Stephen Miller—effectively shut down the conversation. The last text of the day came from “Pete Hegseth,” who wrote at 9:46 a.m., “Agree.”\n\nAfter reading this chain, I recognized that this conversation possessed a high degree of verisimilitude. The texts, in their word choice and arguments, sounded as if they were written by the people who purportedly sent them, or by a particularly adept AI text generator. I was still concerned that this could be a disinformation operation, or a simulation of some sort. And I remained mystified that no one in the group seemed to have noticed my presence. But if it was a hoax, the quality of mimicry and the level of foreign-policy insight were impressive.\n\nIt was the next morning, Saturday, March 15, when this story became truly bizarre.\n\nAt 11:44 a.m., the account labeled “Pete Hegseth” posted in Signal a “TEAM UPDATE.” I will not quote from this update, or from certain other subsequent texts. The information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command’s area of responsibility. What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing.\n\nThe only person to reply to the update from Hegseth was the person identified as the vice president. “I will say a prayer for victory,” Vance wrote. (Two other users subsequently added prayer emoji.)\n\nAccording to the lengthy Hegseth text, the first detonations in Yemen would be felt two hours hence, at 1:45 p.m. eastern time. So I waited in my car in a supermarket parking lot. If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned, Houthi targets would soon be bombed. At about 1:55, I checked X and searched Yemen. Explosions were then being heard across Sanaa, the capital city.\n\nI went back to the Signal channel. At 1:48, “Michael Waltz” had provided the group an update. Again, I won’t quote from this text, except to note that he described the operation as an “amazing job.” A few minutes later, “John Ratcliffe” wrote, “A good start.” Not long after, Waltz responded with three emoji: a fist, an American flag, and fire. Others soon joined in, including “MAR,” who wrote, “Good Job Pete and your team!!,” and “Susie Wiles,” who texted, “Kudos to all – most particularly those in theater and CENTCOM! Really great. God bless.” “Steve Witkoff” responded with five emoji: two hands-praying, a flexed bicep, and two American flags. “TG” responded, “Great work and effects!” The after-action discussion included assessments of damage done, including the likely death of a specific individual. The Houthi-run Yemeni health ministry reported that at least 53 people were killed in the strikes, a number that has not been independently verified.\n\nOn Sunday, Waltz appeared on ABC’s This Week and contrasted the strikes with the Biden administration’s more hesitant approach. “These were not kind of pinprick, back-and-forth—what ultimately proved to be feckless attacks,” he said. “This was an overwhelming response that actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out.”\n\nThe Signal chat group, I concluded, was almost certainly real. Having come to this realization, one that seemed nearly impossible only hours before, I removed myself from the Signal group, understanding that this would trigger an automatic notification to the group’s creator, “Michael Waltz,” that I had left. No one in the chat had seemed to notice that I was there. And I received no subsequent questions about why I left—or, more to the point, who I was.\n\nEarlier today, I emailed Waltz and sent him a message on his Signal account. I also wrote to Pete Hegseth, John Ratcliffe, Tulsi Gabbard, and other officials. In an email, I outlined some of my questions: Is the “Houthi PC small group” a genuine Signal thread? Did they know that I was included in this group? Was I (on the off chance) included on purpose? If not, who did they think I was? Did anyone realize who I was when I was added, or when I removed myself from the group? Do senior Trump-administration officials use Signal regularly for sensitive discussions? Do the officials believe that the use of such a channel could endanger American personnel?\n\nBrian Hughes, the spokesman for the National Security Council, responded two hours later, confirming the veracity of the Signal group. “This appears to be an authentic message chain, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,” Hughes wrote. “The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to troops or national security.”\n\nWilliam Martin, a spokesperson for Vance, said that despite the impression created by the texts, the vice president is fully aligned with the president. “The Vice President’s first priority is always making sure that the President’s advisers are adequately briefing him on the substance of their internal deliberations,” he said. “Vice President Vance unequivocally supports this administration’s foreign policy. The President and the Vice President have had subsequent conversations about this matter and are in complete agreement.”\n\nI have never seen a breach quite like this. It is not uncommon for national-security officials to communicate on Signal. But the app is used primarily for meeting planning and other logistical matters—not for detailed and highly confidential discussions of a pending military action. And, of course, I’ve never heard of an instance in which a journalist has been invited to such a discussion.\n\nConceivably, Waltz, by coordinating a national-security-related action over Signal, may have violated several provisions of the Espionage Act, which governs the handling of “national defense” information, according to several national-security lawyers interviewed by my colleague Shane Harris for this story. Harris asked them to consider a hypothetical scenario in which a senior U.S. official creates a Signal thread for the express purpose of sharing information with Cabinet officials about an active military operation. He did not show them the actual Signal messages or tell them specifically what had occurred.\n\nAll of these lawyers said that a U.S. official should not establish a Signal thread in the first place. Information about an active operation would presumably fit the law’s definition of “national defense” information. The Signal app is not approved by the government for sharing classified information. The government has its own systems for that purpose. If officials want to discuss military activity, they should go into a specially designed space known as a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF—most Cabinet-level national-security officials have one installed in their home—or communicate only on approved government equipment, the lawyers said. Normally, cellphones are not permitted inside a SCIF, which suggests that as these officials were sharing information about an active military operation, they could have been moving around in public. Had they lost their phones, or had they been stolen, the potential risk to national security would have been severe.\n\nHegseth, Ratcliffe, and other Cabinet-level officials presumably would have the authority to declassify information, and several of the national-security lawyers noted that the hypothetical officials on the Signal chain might claim that they had declassified the information they shared. But this argument rings hollow, they cautioned, because Signal is not an authorized venue for sharing information of such a sensitive nature, regardless of whether it has been stamped “top secret” or not.\n\nThere was another potential problem: Waltz set some of the messages in the Signal group to disappear after one week, and some after four. That raises questions about whether the officials may have violated federal records law: Text messages about official acts are considered records that should be preserved.\n\n“Under the records laws applicable to the White House and federal agencies, all government employees are prohibited from using electronic-messaging applications such as Signal for official business, unless those messages are promptly forwarded or copied to an official government account,” Jason R. Baron, a professor at the University of Maryland and the former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration, told Harris.\n\n“Intentional violations of these requirements are a basis for disciplinary action. Additionally, agencies such as the Department of Defense restrict electronic messaging containing classified information to classified government networks and/or networks with government-approved encrypted features,” Baron said.\n\nSeveral former U.S. officials told Harris and me that they had used Signal to share unclassified information and to discuss routine matters, particularly when traveling overseas without access to U.S. government systems. But they knew never to share classified or sensitive information on the app, because their phones could have been hacked by a foreign intelligence service, which would have been able to read the messages on the devices. It is worth noting that Donald Trump, as a candidate for president (and as president), repeatedly and vociferously demanded that Hillary Clinton be imprisoned for using a private email server for official business when she was secretary of state. (It is also worth noting that Trump was indicted in 2023 for mishandling classified documents, but the charges were dropped after his election.)\n\nWaltz and the other Cabinet-level officials were already potentially violating government policy and the law simply by texting one another about the operation. But when Waltz added a journalist—presumably by mistake—to his principals committee, he created new security and legal issues. Now the group was transmitting information to someone not authorized to receive it. That is the classic definition of a leak, even if it was unintentional, and even if the recipient of the leak did not actually believe it was a leak until Yemen came under American attack.\n\nAll along, members of the Signal group were aware of the need for secrecy and operations security. In his text detailing aspects of the forthcoming attack on Houthi targets, Hegseth wrote to the group—which, at the time, included me—“We are currently clean on OPSEC.”\n\nShane Harris contributed reporting."

Join Today! to listen to this post.\n\nHappy Monday! The second round of voting in our inaugural Dispawtch bracket is live, and not a single cat advanced to the Sweet 16. Get your votes in by 8 p.m. ET on Wednesday to have a say in which canines make it to the Elite Eight.\n\nEditor’s Note: Penny seems totally unfazed by her early exit from the tournament and sends her congratulations to Adelaide on a well-earned victory, but Penny’s humans are a little distraught.\n\nQuick Hits: Today’s Top Stories\n\nIsraeli warplanes struck Hamas targets across the Gaza Strip overnight Saturday, killing Salah al-Bardawil, a senior member of the terrorist group’s political bureau. The ongoing aerial attacks came as Israeli troops expanded ground operations aimed at destroying Hamas infrastructure and creating a buffer zone along the Israel-Gaza border. Meanwhile, six rockets were fired at northern Israel from Lebanon on Saturday morning—the first such attack since December. Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed terrorist organization, denied responsibility for the rocket fire, which threatened to upend a November ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon. Hours later, Israel carried out airstrikes on dozens of Hezbollah command centers and rocket launchers.\n\nSudan’s army seized the country’s presidential palace on Friday, delivering the Sudanese Armed Forces an important political and military victory as it seeks to reclaim the entirety of Khartoum from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. The capital city has been at the center of fighting since the start of the war—which has left more than 28,000 people dead nationwide and displaced 11 million others—in April 2023. In January, the State Department determined that both sides of the conflict had committed war crimes.\n\nThe Trump administration plans to revoke temporary legal status for more than 530,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, according to a Federal Register notice published Friday. The move, which follows President Donald Trump’s January executive order directing the Department of Homeland Security to “terminate all categorical parole programs that are contrary to the policies of the United States,” will end the Biden administration’s two-year parole program for immigrants who arrived by air and had American sponsors. The administration urged the immigrants to leave the country before the change takes effect on April 24.\n\nColumbia University on Friday agreed to the many demands made by the Trump administration after the White House withheld $400 million in federal grants and contracts, alleging that the university created a climate of antisemitism on campus. In a memo, the university’s interim president, Dr. Katrina Armstrong, said that Columbia would hire a team of campus police officers with the power to arrest students, establish a committee dedicated to promoting free speech and academic freedom on campus, revise antidiscrimination policies and disciplinary processes, and require demonstrators to present Columbia ID when asked, among a slew of other policies.\n\nThe Trump administration on Friday selected Boeing to lead the development of the F-47 fighter, the Air Force’s next-generation air superiority and drone coordination jet, a major coup for the embattled aerospace company. Named after Trump, the 47th president, the fighter is expected to fight alongside autonomous aircraft made by Anduril Industries and General Atomics. The new projects are part of the Next Generation Air Dominance effort, meant to succeed Lockheed Martin’s F-22 Raptor, which had been paused earlier this year due to cost concerns.\n\nMore than 100 staffers in the Department of Homeland Security’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties were put on leave Friday, as the DHS announced plans to cut the office, along with the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman. Both offices are responsible for ensuring that the DHS complies with equal protection and civil rights laws. “These reductions ensure taxpayer dollars support the Department’s core mission: border security and immigration enforcement,” a DHS spokesperson said.\n\nPope Francis was discharged from the Gemelli hospital in Rome on Sunday, the end of a stay that began on February 14 when he entered the hospital with double pneumonia. One of his physicians, Dr. Sergio Alfieri, told reporters that the pontiff experienced multiple life-threatening episodes while in the hospital, but has recovered from his pneumonia and will require at least two months of rest. He is expected to return to his duties as soon as possible, and gave a public blessing while leaving the hospital.\n\nTurkey’s ‘Navalny Moment’?\n\nHundreds of thousands of protesters gathered in cities across Turkey on Sunday night, with many calling for an end to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s rule after more than two decades in power. The mass demonstrations, now approaching their sixth day, followed the arrest last week of the longtime Turkish leader’s chief political rival: Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu.\n\nEarlier in the day, some 15 million people supported İmamoğlu—the only candidate on the ballot—in the presidential primary of Turkey’s main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP). The party opened voting to non-CHP members, garnering a large turnout in a show of national solidarity with the embattled politician. Meanwhile on Sunday, Turkish authorities jailed İmamoğlu pending a trial and stripped him of his mayorship. The move—widely viewed as an attempt to preemptively bar the popular opposition leader from running in the country’s presidential election, which must be held by May 2028—marked Turkey’s latest and most dire departure from its democratic tradition.\n\n“As a defender of democracy and believer in the power of the people, I trust that the truth will prevail,” İmamoğlu said during his first appearance in court on Saturday. “I feel the strength of millions behind me and cannot even put into words the courage it gives me.”\n\nNationwide protests began on Wednesday, hours after police first arrested İmamoğlu in his Istanbul home on charges of “establishing and managing a criminal organization, taking bribes, extortion, unlawfully recording personal data and rigging a tender.” A day earlier, Istanbul University had revoked his degree under apparent pressure from Ankara, threatening his presidential bid as, under the Turkish constitution, presidential candidates must have completed higher education. The ousted mayor has also faced accusations of aiding a terrorist group—charges he categorically denies.\n\nİmamoğlu rose to national prominence in 2019 after defeating Erdoğan’s handpicked candidate for mayor of Istanbul. Ever since, he’s faced dubious prosecution and threats of being banned from holding public office, including for “insulting” election officials who voided his victory in the local election, thereby forcing another race that İmamoğlu won by an even larger margin. But he continues to garner nationwide support, earning the reputation—even outside of the CHP—of being an impressive orator and capable potential challenger to Erdoğan when the time comes for elections.\n\n“He’s got that sort of X factor, in terms of both rhetoric and presence,” Sinan Ciddi, a non-resident senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies who focuses on Turkish politics, told TMD. “But also, just being mayor of Istanbul really elevates you to a national status.” Erdoğan himself held the coveted office from 1994 to 1998.\n\nThe demonstrators now taking to the streets calling for İmamoğlu’s release are a mixed bag. While some simply want the government to drop the charges against İmamoğlu to let the democratic process play out, others are demanding Erdoğan’s ouster after more than two decades in power. While many are longtime CHP supporters, most are young people who see a broader assault on their rights unfolding.\n\n“Erdoğan has been in power for more than 20 years, as prime minister and now as president,” Utku Barut, a master’s student who attended a Sunday protest outside of Istanbul’s city hall, told TMD. “Young people who are voting right now were born in Erdoğan’s regime. … They’ve only seen one political party ruling the country.”\n\nIn Istanbul and other cities across the country, Turkish authorities sought to squash the protests before they ever began, blockading roads and shutting down metro stations. They also restricted access to various social media and messaging platforms, according to the NetBlocks tracker, forcing users to access the internet via a virtual private network. Several X accounts belonging to opposition organizers were also suspended, sparking accusations that the platform had booted the activists at the request of the Turkish government.\n\nPolice used water cannons, pepper spray, and tear gas at the demonstrations in an effort to disburse the crowds, and some attendees even reported being shot with rubber bullets. Hundreds have been detained. Meanwhile, the government has largely suppressed coverage of the unrest, using its nearly unfettered control over Turkish media to prevent the protests from being broadcast live.\n\nFor many people in Turkey, the events of the last week seem to mark a turning point. In recent years, elections have typically been regarded as free but not fair: The process itself is democratic, but Erdoğan, as Turkey’s sole executive, can marshall the resources of the state to influence the outcome. By seeking to prevent the opposition from choosing its own nominee, the president has plunged the country into new, uncharted territory.\n\n“This is the first time I know of that Turkey’s government has said, ‘I get to choose who runs against me, not the people,’” Ciddi said. “It’s very difficult to describe Turkey now, even under the most simple definition, as a democracy.”\n\n“There’s increasing worry that this is a Navalny moment,” he added, referring to Alexei Navalny, the Russian opposition leader whose 2021 arrest led to mass protests and who later died in an Arctic penal colony.\n\nAnd as the relatively muted response from the international community thus far has demonstrated, civil disobedience may be the only force holding the Turkish president to account. Erdoğan and U.S. President Donald Trump have long had good personal chemistry, with the Turkish leader welcoming the return of his “friend” to Washington after the November election. Trump is reportedly considering selling Turkey F-35 fighter jets, reversing its exclusion from the program in July 2019 over its acquisition of the Russian-made S-400 air defense system. Erdoğan is also eyeing a White House visit next month.\n\nResponding to a question about İmamoğlu’s arrest during a Wednesday press briefing, State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce encouraged Turkey to “respect human rights” but added: “We’re not going to comment on … the internal decision-making of another country … except to remind them that we expect them to behave in a manner that respects the rights of all of its citizens.”\n\nEuropean countries, meanwhile, are looking to Ankara—a prospective European Union member—as a partner in their efforts to bolster the continent’s collective defense. Turkey has the second-largest army in NATO, behind only the United States.\n\n“It’s a NATO member, an aspiring European Union member, and a treaty ally of the United States, so we should be worried,” Ciddi said. “Turkey is headed toward a very, very dark place.”\n\nToday’s Must-Read\n\nA New Exodus\n\nOnly about 10 percent of American Jews are Orthodox, generally defined by adherence to traditional Jewish law, such as Sabbath and kosher observance. Fewer still are Orthodox and interested in receiving a secular higher education. These Modern Orthodox—distinguished by traditional observance combined with full participation in American life—have long maintained a disproportionate presence at elite universities relative to their population size. … Yet these students feel the weight of recent campus controversies most acutely, as they are both “visibly” Jewish—often identifiable by their dress—and near-unanimously ardent Zionists.\n\nToeing the Company Line\n\nPolitics March 21, 2025\n\nBad Faith\n\nHow much judicial deference is owed to an untrustworthy president?\n\nEconomics March 21, 2025\n\nThe Energy That Fuels the American Dream\n\nPeople need mobility—and freedom—to pursue happiness.\n\nSociety & Culture March 22, 2025\n\nThe Hurt We Carry\n\nThe hit show ‘Severance’ shows the limits of dissociation.\n\nSociety & Culture March 22, 2025\n\nA Century of Flannery O’Connor\n\nThe Southern writer has a depth that's hard to find today.\n\nPolitics March 24, 2025\n\nMike Johnson’s House Math Problem Gets Easier to Solve\n\nThe speaker will soon have a (slightly) larger GOP majority for the next legislative battle.\n\nPodcast March 22, 2025\n\nNo Rulers\n\nIntellectual earworms, stand-up comedy, and chinchilla farms.\n\nWorth Your Time\n\nHamas’ October 7, 2023, attack and the ensuing war laid bare major intra-Democratic Party divisions over U.S. support for Israel. But those fissures are increasingly evident on the American right, too, as antisemitic conspiracy theories take hold in populist circles, argued New York Times columnist Ross Douthat. “More so than in the Democratic Party, most Republican elites remain staunchly pro-Israel. But on what you might call the alienated right—younger, conspiracy-curious, anti-institutional and very online—there is a vogue for arguments about malign Jewish influences on Western politics, ranging from World War II revisionism to narratives casting Jeffrey Epstein as a cat’s paw for the Mossad,” he wrote. “There’s just no way for mainstream Zionist Republicanism and the anti-Jewish faction on the alienated right to get along. … Those parts of the alienated right that are most comfortable deploying antisemitic tropes also believe earnestly not just in some general theory of Jewish power but in a specific theory of Israel’s power, Israel’s malign influence, Israeli leaders and institutions and spies as conspiratorial and destructive forces in American life.”\n\nIt’s been 18 months since devastating fires in Maui destroyed more than 2,000 homes. But only 6 have been rebuilt. In City Journal, Alex Hu examined the web of regulations, laws, and local government failures that have made the island’s efforts to rebuild so lethargic. “The political divide has only grown wider since the fires. Aside from activists seeking Internet fame by provoking viral confrontations at public meetings, radical councilmembers have called their pro-building colleagues names like ‘colonizer,’ openly questioned what would happen if they defied Hawaii state law promoting homebuilding, and advocated for secession from the United States. A general spirit of conspiracy and bad faith pervades the island’s politics,” he wrote. “These local dynamics discouraged Governor [Josh] Green from taking aggressive action. Suspicious residents interpreted his initial promises to rebuild Lahaina quickly as a plot to redevelop the historic town to profit ‘outside’ developers. He backed off in response. Even Mayor [Richard] Bissen has avoided taking strong actions or asking for strong state assistance for fear of looking like an outsider dictating terms to West Maui.”\n\nNBC News: Putin Said He Prayed for ‘His Friend’ Donald Trump After 2024 Assassination Attempt, U.S. Envoy [Steve Witkoff] Says\n\nWitkoff said some people might question if he should have met with the Russian president because they see Putin as “a bad guy.” But he said: “I don’t regard Putin as a bad guy.”\n\nA real estate tycoon and friend of the president who has become a top diplomatic envoy for Trump, Wiktoff said he appreciated Putin being open to meeting with him and communicating in a “straightforward” way.\n\n“I liked him. I thought he was straight up with me,” he said, adding that “it was gracious of him to accept me, to see me.”\n\nBloomberg: Secret Biden Deal Allowed Chevron to Pay Venezuela Millions\n\nThe Biden administration secretly permitted Chevron Corp. to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to the Venezuelan government despite a license that explicitly prohibited such disbursements, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe supplement to a November 2022 sanctions waiver allowed Chevron to remain in compliance with US law while paying the regime of President Nicolás Maduro taxes and oil royalties, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing non-public information.\n\nAxios: Seniors Won’t Complain if They Miss a Social Security Check, Lutnick Says\n\n“Let’s say Social Security didn’t send out their checks this month.

She’d think something got messed up, and she’ll get it next month. A fraudster always makes the loudest noise, screaming, yelling and complaining.”\n\nIn the Zeitgeist\n\nThe second season of Severance, the popular dystopian thriller starring Adam Scott of Parks and Recreation fame, came to a close last week on yet another cliffhanger.

        "full_text": "“A lot of people in Canada are liking becoming our beautiful, cherished 51st state. They’ll have to pay much lower taxes.”\n\n— President Donald Trump, remarks to the media, Feb. 25\n\n“They [Canadians] wouldn’t be paying for these tariffs. They’d have much lower taxes if they were part of this great country.”\n\n— White House press secretary Katherine Leavitt, remarks at a news briefing, March 6\n\nTrump has made it clear that he thinks Canada, a NATO member that shares a 5,500-mile border with the United States, should give up its sovereignty and become the 51st state. One of his main arguments is that it makes financial sense.\n\nNot only would he not impose tariffs — which he wrongly claims are paid by Canadians when in fact they are largely paid by American importers and consumers — but he and his press secretary argue that Canadians would face “much lower taxes” if they joined the United States.\n\nAre they right?\n\nThe Facts\n\nFirst, we confirmed with the White House that Trump and Leavitt were not simply suggesting the elimination of tariffs would mean lower taxes. A White House official said they were referring to income tax rates and sent us a link to an article on an independent Canadian news website, The Hub, that said “Canada’s marginal tax rates are much higher than America’s.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat are marginal tax rates? That refers to the tax imposed on each additional dollar of income. Both the U.S. and Canadian systems are progressive, meaning tax rates get higher as a person’s income increases. Canada starts at 15 percent, and the U.S. starts at 10 percent — but the top American rate is 37 percent, compared with 33 percent for Canadians.\n\nIn other words, a person making $750,000 in the United States would be paying a 37 percent rate in the U.S., compared with 33 percent in Canada. The United States also levies an additional 3.8 percent tax on investment income once income is above $250,000. So the marginal income-tax rate, in effect, could be above 40 percent in the United States.\n\nThe Hub article combines both state (or, in the case of Canada, province) and federal income taxes to calculate the marginal rates. Because Canadian provinces have higher income tax rates than U.S. states (some of which have zero income taxes), they all rank higher than the state with the highest marginal rate — California. The article quoted University of Calgary economics professor Trevor Tombe as saying that marginal tax rates, especially at higher incomes, were a factor in wealthy earners seeking to work in the United States.\n\nBut it’s very difficult to compare the tax systems of different nations on an apples-to-apples basis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCanada, for instance, does not permit a deduction for mortgage payments, a somewhat sacred cow in the U.S. system. Canada also has a universal health care system — which is administered at the provincial level, one reason the provinces have higher tax rates. The United States has no such health-care system except for Medicaid (for the poor) and Medicare (for the elderly). Instead, Americans must fork over their own money for health insurance or get health coverage through their employer (which in effect is part of their income, though untaxed).\n\nIn other words, marginal rates tell only part of the story. Tax deductions can mitigate those rates — or they can help pay for things, such as health insurance, that are not provided in another country.\n\nCristina Enache, global tax economist at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, said the overall tax burden (the ratio of taxes to gross domestic product) is much higher in Canada than the United States: 34.8 percent versus 25.2 percent. (This figure includes corporate taxes, so it’s broader than just individual taxes.) Excluding health care spending in each country, she calculated the average tax burden in the U.S. would be 18.96 percent, while in Canada it would be 22.48 percent. That’s a difference of 3.5 percentage points, including corporate taxes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTombe said that perhaps the most relevant and authoritative comparison at the individual level was a report, “Taxing Wages,” that is released annually by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes the world’s wealthiest nations. “This is a good comparable measure across countries that is relevant for most individuals,” he said.\n\nThe OECD focuses on what it calls the “tax wedge.” This is a more sophisticated measure than the marginal tax rate because it includes income taxes and payroll taxes (for programs like Social Security) and also subtracts cash benefits that people receive from the government. In essence, it measures the difference between the labor costs to the employer and the corresponding net take-home pay of the employee.\n\nGoing through the 2023 report — which measures the tax wedge across many income categories — it’s clear that both the United States and Canada have relatively low tax rates in the OECD. The average tax wedge among OECD nations is 34.8 percent of labor costs — and Canada stands at 31.9 percent and the United States at 29.9 percent. By comparison, the highest level was reached by Belgium, at 52.7 percent, followed by Germany (47.9 percent), Austria (47.2 percent) and France (46.8 percent).\n\nThe United States and Canada were also close in the tax wedge for single earners and for one-earner couples with children; both gave a similar tax preference to families. The biggest difference between the two countries was on the taxes imposed on two-earner couples with children. Canada and the United States were still below the OECD average, but Canada’s tax wedge was 28.8 percent and the United States was 24.6 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“While Canadian taxes are slightly higher than the U.S., the difference is minor and both countries have tax rates below the OECD average,” Tombe said.\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nTrump and Leavitt claim that Canadians would pay “much lower taxes” if they joined the United States. That’s a stretch. While marginal rates are higher in Canadian provinces than in American states, Canadians presumably would have to give up government-provided health insurance. Moreover, when assessed by the OECD, there’s not much difference between overall taxes at the individual level in Canada and the United States. Canada is slightly higher, even with better benefits, and both countries have relatively low tax rates compared to their peer group. The overall tax burden gets higher in Canada when corporate taxes are included, but Trump was talking about individual taxes.\n\nIt’s not quite Four Pinocchios, but the White House claim is mostly false.\n\nTrump earns Three Pinocchios.\n\nThree Pinocchios\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles"

        "full_text": "WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Mondaytackled an unusual case in which civil rights groups are in a tentative alliance with Republican officials in defending a Louisiana congressional map that includes two majority Black districts for the first time in decades.\n\nThe justices heard oral arguments in an appeal brought by the state over its efforts to draw a map while being sued from the left and right about whether it appropriately considered race in doing so.\n\nAs in previous cases on these issues, some conservatives on the court questioned whether the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act's requirement that race be considered when drawing districts is compatible with the Constitution's 14th Amendment, which conservatives say bars any consideration of race.\n\nThe Supreme Court's 6-3 conservative majority is often receptive to conservative claims that the Constitution is “colorblind,” meaning no consideration of race can ever be lawful even if it is aimed at remedying past discrimination.\n\nBut while there might be an appetite on the court to potentially strike down a key provision of the voting rights law at some point, the Louisiana dispute does not squarely raise the legal question, so the court could be more likely to uphold the map in a narrow ruling.\n\nAs recently as 2023, the court reaffirmed the Voting Rights Act in a congressional redistricting case arising from Alabama. The vote was 5-4, with two conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, joining the court's three liberals in the majority. The Louisiana case could end up with a similar lineup.\n\nThe case has a complicated history, resulting from an original map drawn by the Legislature after the 2020 census that included just one Black majority district out of the state's six districts. About a third of the state's population is Black.\n\nCivil rights groups, including the Legal Defense Fund, sued and ultimately won, arguing that the Voting Rights Act required two majority Black districts.\n\nThat led to a new lawsuit filed by a group of self-identified \"non-African American\" voters led by Phillip Callais and 11 other plaintiffs who said the latest map, which is currently in effect, violated the 14th Amendment.\n\nA federal court struck the new map down, but the state successfully asked the Supreme Court to block the ruling last year, meaning the map was used in November's election. Rep. Cleo Fields, D-La., ultimately won the newly drawn district.\n\nNow, the Supreme Court is deciding whether the 2024 map can remain in place, weighing several legal questions.\n\nDuring the argument, Kavanaugh repeated concerns he raised in the 2023 case that there should be an end point for race to be considered in redistricting, indicating he could eventually be a vote to strike down Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\n\n\"The court has long said that race-based remedial action must have a logical end point, must be limited in time, must be a temporary matter,\" Kavanaugh said.\n\nConservative Justice Neil Gorsuch asked similar questions.\n\n\"Isn't saying race was one consideration another way of saying race predominated? And how do we square that with the 14th Amendment's promise that race should play no role?\" he asked.\n\nRoberts, meanwhile, questioned whether the congressional map met redistricting criteria because the newly drawn second majority Black district is not sufficiently compact. He described it as a \"snake that runs from one of the state to the other.\"\n\nSeveral justices, perhaps seeing an easy way to resolve the case, focused on precedent saying that states need leeway to draw the districts of their choosing. Other Supreme Court precedent says states are free to consider partisan politics as part of that calculation.\n\nLiberal Justice Elena Kagan said that in drafting the new map, the state was focused on politics, not race, because it drew the lines in a way that protected Republican incumbents, including House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\n\"If the state can't do that, the state has no breathing room,\" she added.\n\nIn a similar vein, liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that based on the earlier Voting Rights Act litigation, the state had a \"good faith basis\" for believing it needed to comply with the law.\n\nFellow liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pointed out that the Supreme Court has never held that race is a key factor when states are drawing maps to comply with the Voting Rights Act.\n\n\"I thought we suggested the opposite,\" she added.\n\nIn defending the new map, Louisiana Solicitor General Benjamin Aguiñaga wrote in court papers that currently the state is being sued no matter what it does, causing it to spend millions of dollars on legal expenses.\n\n\"No one truly wins that fight — the state loses, its voters lose, the judiciary loses, and democracy itself loses,\" he wrote.\n\nThe challengers said in court papers that the new map constitutes an \"odious racial gerrymander.\" None of the state's reasons constitute a \"compelling justification for violating the 14th Amendment,\" they added."

        "full_text": "Sophia Ahmed delivered the news on Monday with a two-word message in all capital letters: “WE WON.”\n\nA court had ruled that the annual, on-campus drag show she and classmates at Texas A&M University had organized could still happen this Thursday.\n\nSince May, the students had booked a theater, selected performers and started selling tickets — plans the university system interrupted last month by banning drag events on its campuses, citing President Donald Trump’s “Day 1” executive order on gender ideology.\n\nA week later, the Texas A&M student group hosting “Draggieland” sued, putting the fate of the drag show in the hands of a federal judge.\n\nBlocking the show “because it offends some members of the campus community is precisely what the First Amendment prohibits,” U.S. District Judge Lee Rosenthal wrote Monday in a ruling that temporarily lifted the university system’s ban. After the decision came down, Ahmed, president of the group hosting the show, the Texas A&M Queer Empowerment Council, spread the word to fellow organizers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPreparations — and ticket sales — resumed. Doors will open Thursday at the university’s Rudder Theatre in College Station.\n\n“It boils down to being an example of queer joy on campus,” Ahmed said.\n\nLawyers from the Texas attorney general’s office, which is representing the university system, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. After the ruling, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) wrote on X that drag shows “promote radical gender ideology. They are not welcome at Texas universities.”\n\nIn Texas and across the country, conservative lawmakers have targeted drag performances in recent years as part of a larger effort aimed at restricting LGBTQ+ rights. Trump has taken this conservative priority to new heights since assuming office, with attempts to hinder access to gender-affirming care for people under 19 and ban transgender adults from military service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo years ago, the president of West Texas A&M University — part of the same system as the College Station flagship — canceled a student-organized drag show, writing that drag events “denigrate and demean women” and comparing them with blackface.\n\nBut Texas A&M’s “Draggieland” had never faced a threat of this magnitude in its five-year run. For a time, the university had even sponsored the show, whose title combines drag with students’ “Aggie” nickname. When the school ceased its sponsorship before the 2022 show, students took over fundraising, and they continued putting on the show every year at Rudder Theatre. Hundreds have watched local drag performers compete in a themed pageant for the title of Queen or King of “Draggieland.”\n\nFor this year’s show, planning started smoothly.\n\nIn the summer, organizers picked showrunners and settled on a theme, “Slaying the Seven Seas.” In the fall, they held auditions and nailed down finances. Come winter, ticket sales started. Students planned the production in intricate detail, down to purchasing ornaments on clearance after the holidays and painting them an iridescent white to serve as pearls for the show’s set design.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“This couldn’t have happened had we not started planning so far in advance,” Ahmed said.\n\nThey paused their planning on Feb. 28 when the Texas A&M Board of Regents adopted a resolution banning drag shows on its campuses.\n\nDrag performances, the resolution said, “often involve unwelcome and objectively offensive conduct” and “are likely to create or contribute to a hostile environment for women.”\n\nThe board cited Trump’s executive order prohibiting federal funds from being used to “promote gender ideology” — and Abbott’s support of that order — before stipulating that on-campus drag shows “may be considered promotion of gender ideology” under the new directive. The resolution noted that students seeking to put on drag shows could access off-campus and private spaces near the system’s schools.\n\nOn March 5, the Queer Empowerment Council sued the board, the system’s chancellor and the Texas A&M University president in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“What’s offensive and what’s not offensive is purely subjective, and that’s a line that the First Amendment forbids government officials from being able to draw on campus or off,” said Adam Steinbaugh, an attorney for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, which is representing the students.\n\n“Draggieland” performers frequently — but not always — make clothing choices to “deliberately contrast with their expected gender presentation,” and are not nude or partially nude, the lawsuit states. It adds that the event is exclusively funded by students, and lists examples of previous and upcoming events at Rudder Theatre. They include a panel by the school’s Christian Faculty Network, a speech by Turning Point USA leader Charlie Kirk, a production of the musical “Chicago” and a “Ready to Vote Tour” event featuring former Democratic congressman Beto O’Rourke, according to the lawsuit.\n\nWhile they waited for a ruling, the students considered their options. Could they host the show at a different venue? Would a different date work?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey wanted to put on the show no matter what, Ahmed said, but having it on campus felt crucial.\n\n“It’s a display of queer resilience,” she said. “No matter what you try, queer people will be here to stay.”\n\nOn Monday, Rosenthal’s temporary ruling made the backup plans unnecessary. The show would go on as scheduled.\n\nOn Thursday, when the show begins and the blue and green lights transport attendees to the seas for the night, Ahmed will be there, sitting in the theater with hundreds of other showgoers as in past years.\n\nShe will be cheering and screaming from the start, she said, because the students had fought for this moment — and they won."

        "full_text": "A federal appeals court panel denied President Donald Trump's request to have a restraining order overturned Wednesday, which stopped his administration from deporting suspected Venezuelan gang members without a court hearing.\n\nThe appeals court ruling doesn't completely stop Trump's ability to deport people, he just can't use the Alien Enemy's Act (AEA) as the justification with regards to the plaintiffs listed in the case. The restraining order is also only in place for a few more days.\n\nThe 2-1 vote in the District of Columbia Court of Appeals meant that U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg's Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) remained in place, after he argued that the immigrants the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had alleged were members of the Tren de Aragua gang were still entitled to due process.\n\n\"Before they may be deported, they are entitled to individualized hearings to determine whether the Act applies to them at all,\" Boasberg wrote Monday, referring to the AEA. \"As the Government itself concedes, the awesome power granted by the Act may be brought to bear only on those who are, in fact, 'alien enemies.'\"\n\nBoasberg's comments came hours before the appeals court hearing on the Trump administration's use of the law and whether it was constitutional to implement it at this time.\n\nNewsweek reached out to the White House and the ACLU via email for comment on Monday.\n\nDozens of immigrants accused of being part of Tren de Aragua (TdA) were flown out of the United States to a Salvadoran prison last weekend despite Boasberg's order to halt flights. Immigrants' rights groups, who claim some individuals were falsely labeled gang members because of their tattoos, argue that all people placed in removal proceedings had a right to have their case heard in court.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and at least five immigrants filed an appeal on March 15 in the District of Columbia to prevent the president from invoking the AEA.\n\nDespite Boasberg stepping in and ordering the administration to cancel the flights, two of the three planes had already taken off, with over 200 individuals accused of being TdA members on board.\n\nAmong them was a soccer coach with a Real Madrid-inspired tattoo that his attorney said was mistaken for a TdA mark and a barber whose mother told Newsweek that he had entered the U.S. through a legal pathway.\n\nMonday's order by Boasberg stated that the men sent to El Salvador over a week ago deserved the right to argue these points in court.\n\nBoasberg has repeatedly been vocal in his skepticism of the administration's justification for removing the immigrants without due process. However, Trump, senior White House officials, and Republican members of Congress have called for his removal, claiming he has overstepped his role to get in the way of a law the president has a right to impose.\n\nThe use of the Alien Enemies Act came after the Trump administration declared TdA a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO), alongside Mexican cartels and the MS-13 gang, which began in Los Angeles. Trump has argued that these groups, particularly TdA, have carried out an \"invasion\" in the U.S., therefore allowing him to use the 1798 law.\n\nThe Act enables the federal government to speedily remove illegal immigrants it believes are a national security threat during a declared war or invasion. It was last used during World War II to detain and monitor German, Italian and Japanese immigrants.\n\nThe Trump administration's declaration of an invasion at the southwest border, despite dramatically reduced crossings over the past several months, is the basis for invoking the law now.\n\nAmid the back-and-forth between Boasberg and the White House, the case was back before the D.C. Court of Appeals on Monday afternoon.\n\nThe three-judge panel heard arguments over whether Boasberg could impose restrictions on the Trump administration and whether the administration was correct in its arguments for the AEA's implementation.\n\nD.C. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Patricia Millett asked the administration's attorneys to justify reasons for invoking the AEA, including bypassing court hearings for deported individuals.\n\nMillet said the administration had potentially misread the AEA and that the individuals who were flown to El Salvador should have been given the right to due process, echoing Boasberg's words. She referred to the deportations of suspected Nazis during World War II, where individuals were given a chance to argue their case.\n\nOn Wednesday, the three-judge panel issued its decision denying the Trump administration's petition to have the TRO revoked.\n\nJudge Karen L. Henderson, who was appointed by former President George H.W. Bush, appeared skeptical of the government's claim that an invasion was underway at the border in order to invoke the AEA.\n\n\"The term 'invasion' was a legal term of art with a well-defined meaning at the Founding,\" Henderson wrote in her concurring statement. \"It required far more than an unwanted entry; to constitute an invasion, there had to be hostilities.\"\n\nThe decision means that the administration is still not able to remove plaintiffs from the country, at least until the TRO expires in a few days.\n\nIn his memo on Monday, Boasberg made it clear that his restraining order only applied to using the AEA against the plaintiffs listed and did not stop the government from deporting people through other means.\n\nThe restraining order does not prevent federal agents from arresting alleged TdA or other FTO members. It also doesn't force officials to release them from custody. Plaintiffs are also not asking for this.\n\nOther deportation routes are unaffected, the appeals court panel affirmed, but it was clear in Boasberg's memorandum that he believed alleged illegal immigrants, whether suspected gang members or not, deserved the right to due process.\n\n\"The Constitution's demand of due process cannot be so easily thrown aside,\" Judge Patricia Millett, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, wrote, stating this was why she had to deny the government's appeal.\n\nTrump campaigned heavily on immigration, following years of increased illegal border crossings, which began during his previous term and continued under former President Joe Biden.\n\nThe Republican promised mass deportations of illegal immigrants, focusing on known serious and violent criminals, such as those in transnational criminal gangs like TdA. He also said upward of 11 million people could be removed from the country, referencing those without legal status. Many have been in the U.S. for decades.\n\nSince returning to the White House in January, DHS has maneuvered federal agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), as well as from other agencies, such as the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to ramp up arrests of illegal immigrants.\n\nHundreds of thousands of immigrants who arrived legally through Biden-era programs such as humanitarian parole are set to have their status revoked by the Trump administration, opening them up to potential removal.\n\nICE has been under pressure to deliver on deporting as many of those detained as possible. However, reports and DHS data suggest removals have not increased drastically since the Biden administration.\n\nD.C. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Patricia Millett, during Monday's hearing: \"Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act than what happened here.\"\n\nD.C. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Justin Walker, in his dissenting statement: \"Deportees are already petitioning for habeas corpus in Texas. At least one petitioner has already secured a hearing date in the Southern District of Texas, plus a TRO preventing his removal in the interim. According to the Government, that's exactly what Plaintiffs here should have done and still can.\n\n\"The district court here in Washington, D.C. — 1,475 miles from the El Valle Detention Facility in Raymondville, Texas — is not the right court to hear the Plaintiffs' claims. The Government likely faces irreparable harm to ongoing, highly sensitive international diplomacy and national-security operations.\"\n\nJudge James Boasberg, speaking about alleged FTO members in his memo on Monday: \"The noncitizens comprising the class are already in United States custody, and any actual Tren de Aragua member is already subject to deportation as a member of an FTO, so there is little additional harm to the public by temporarily preventing their removal.\n\n\"There is, moreover, a strong public interest in preventing the mistaken deportation of people based on categories they have no right to challenge. The public also has a significant stake in the Government's compliance with the law.\"\n\nTrump's border czar, Tom Homan, told ABC News on March 23: \"We're going to keep targeting the worst of the worst, which we've been doing since day one, and deporting from the United States through the various laws on the books.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on March 20: \"Americans can absolutely expect to see the continuation of the mass deportation campaign that has been successfully led by this president.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has made it clear it will continue with its deportation program despite the ongoing legal challenges."

        "full_text": "LOS ANGELES—The City Council approved a package of motions Wednesday aimed at protecting legal and illegal immigrants in Los Angeles amid a federal crackdown on illegal immigration and threats to so-called sanctuary cities.\n\nIn a 10–0 vote, council members instructed staff to report back on policies that would require businesses to notify the city of all Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity, as well as to inform workers of their rights ahead of potential raids.\n\nAdditionally, the council directed city staff to identify about $540,000 to maintain immigration legal services—which would cover a gap created when the Trump administration froze such funding.\n\nCouncil members John Lee, Tim McOsker, Adrin Nazarian, Traci Park, and Nithya Raman were absent during the vote.\n\nThe city council approved two other motions on a 12–0 vote. Those motions required separate action after council members Monica Rodriguez and Ysabel Jurado introduced amendments. McOsker, Park, and Raman were absent for those votes.\n\nCouncil members authorized staff to begin work on a citywide “Know Your Rights Campaign,” which is expected to inform L.A. immigrants, including illegal immigrants, about nondiscrimination protections, the city’s sanctuary policy, and other resources available to them.\n\nIn her amendment, Rodriguez requested that the Los Angeles Police Department report on its process for handling U-Visas. The visas are available to people who are victims of crimes such as domestic violence and sexual assault, among others. The LAPD is expected to address how many of the visas have been issued since 2017, as well as any barriers victims face in securing them.\n\nCouncil members requested a report on ways to review compliance with the city’s “sanctuary” policy, which prohibits the use of city resources and personnel for federal immigration enforcement.\n\nJurado’s amendment requested an analysis of the California Values Act. Specifically, she said she hopes it will provide guidance to the LAPD—in response to reports that officers provided traffic control during ICE raids in the Pico Union area. Mayor Karen Bass’ office and LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell said the operation in question involved federal officers serving a criminal warrant in a human trafficking investigation.\n\nMcDonnell also repeated his stance that LAPD does not participate in immigration enforcement, a policy that has been in place since 1979.\n\nAs part of the actions on Wednesday, the council also approved a resolution declaring the city’s position in favor of California increasing funding for deportation defense for legal and illegal immigrants.\n\nFollowing Wednesday’s meeting, Councilman Hugo Soto-Martinez—who authored the motions alongside several of his colleagues—thanked city departments and immigration advocates who helped craft the proposals.\n\nThe council’s Trade, Travel and Tourism Committee on Tuesday approved a separate motion to provide nonprofit legal services at Los Angeles International Airport in preparation for a potential travel ban. It will be voted on by the full council at a future date.\n\nIn November 2024, the City Council and Mayor Karen Bass formally established Los Angeles as a “sanctuary city.”\n\nWhile the city already had certain policies in place to prevent departments from working with ICE, the designation formally created a policy that no city staff or resources can be used to collaborate with federal immigration authorities without a judicial warrant.\n\nIn his first week in office, President Donald Trump issued several executive orders targeting illegal immigrants and sanctuary cities such as L.A., Chicago, and other Democrat-led jurisdictions, authorizing ICE enforcement in schools and churches, among other places.\n\nThe president has threatened to cut federal funds for sanctuary cities if they do not aid in ICE enforcement."

        "full_text": "“We have had record people wanting to join our military in the last 2½ months literally since this — I think probably since the election November 5th. But especially since we came to office and since I announced Pete. He’s young, he’s smart, he’s strong, he loves it, and they love him. But we’ve had record numbers of people wanting to join our military. Now if you go back six months, it was the exact opposite. You had record numbers of people not wanting to join the military. Now you have record numbers of people wanting to be in our military.”\n\n— President Donald Trump, remarks with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in the Oval Office, March 21\n\nEven when President Donald Trump has a good-news story to tell, he can’t resist embellishing it. It’s not enough that he can point to positive military recruiting numbers. He has to also slam his predecessor: “Now if you go back six months, it was the exact opposite. You had record numbers of people not wanting to join the military.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn reality, military records show, the boost in recruiting began under President Joe Biden, largely because of programs his administration started. Trump diminishes his bragging rights when he suggests nothing changed until he won the election.\n\nThe Facts\n\nSix branches make up the volunteer armed forces: Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Marine Corps, Navy and Space Force. We’ll keep most of our focus on the Army, as the Trump administration has regularly touted recruitment numbers for the Army.\n\nFor instance, on Feb. 4, Hegseth posted on social media: “BREAKING: In December 2024, the @USArmy had its best recruiting number in 12 years. In January 2025, the Army hit its best recruiting number in 15 YEARS. BOTTOM LINE: America’s youth want to serve under the bold & strong ‘America First’ leadership of @realDonaldTrump.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMadison T. Bonzo, a spokesperson for the U.S. Army Recruiting Command, said the statement referred to average gross contracts signed per day. An average of 346 contracts were signed on 17 production days in December, for a total of 5,882. She said that was the highest since December 2009. In January, there were 21 production days and an average of 311 contracts signed a day, for a total of 6,531 — the highest since January 2010.\n\nThese numbers are different from what the Defense Department reports publicly as monthly year-to-date recruiting numbers, dating back to 2016. The DOD reports “accessions,” meaning an individual has not only signed a contract but also was given a date to ship to basic combat training. When the January numbers were officially released, they showed the Army assigned basic training to 6,489 people that month. (We calculated this by comparing the January total with the number listed for recruitment through December.) That’s impressive, but it’s not the best accession number for January shown on the DOD website, which was in 2018 — 7,662.\n\nAs for December, the inconvenient fact is that Biden was still president, which is why Trump cites his election victory in November as the reason.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis argument would have resonance if Biden failed to meet his targets — Trump claimed “if you go back six months, it was the exact opposite” — but this is clearly false.\n\nIn January, Military.com reported that the Army was “already nearly halfway to meeting its ambitious goal of recruiting 61,000 active-duty soldiers during this fiscal year [which started in October]. … The service has 30,000 new enlistments this year — an increase of 6,000 compared to the same period last year, the data shows.” The figure includes about 10,000 people who had signed contracts in the previous fiscal year but had not yet been assigned to basic training.\n\nIn fact, for the 2024 fiscal year that ended in September, the Army reported that it had slightly exceeded its goal of recruiting 55,000 soldiers — a turnaround from the 2023 fiscal year, when it attracted just over 50,000, only 77 percent of its recruiting goal. The highest monthly total was in August 2024 — 8,414 recruits — which was well before the November election. It also happens to be six months ago, meaning Trump got it exactly backward. (The Army Reserve met nearly 73 percent of its recruiting goal, indicating room for improvement.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen-Army Secretary Christine Wormuth told the Associated Press in January that the pandemic devastated military recruiting. On top of that, a good economy made the military less alluring — and too few young adults could meet qualifications for service. Army statistics show that “71 percent of youth [ages 17-24] do not qualify for military service because of obesity, drugs, physical and mental health problems, misconduct, and aptitude.”\n\nThe Biden administration responded by creating a program, the Future Soldier Preparatory Course, at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, in August 2022. Individuals who sign a contract but need to complete the course do not show up in the DOD accession numbers until they earn a spot in basic training.\n\nKatherine L. Kuzminski, director of studies at the Center for a New American Security, credited the boot camp with getting about a quarter of new Army recruits either in shape or meeting required academic standards so they could begin basic training. The program was such a success that the Navy created its own version in 2023. She said the Biden administration took other steps to bolster recruiting, such as new marketing initiatives and elevating recruitment leadership from a two-star to a three-star general.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nIn his first term, Trump routinely took credit for a booming economy that he inherited from Barack Obama. He extended it with a tax cut, but in his telling, he inherited a mess.\n\nNow we see the same pattern with military recruiting. Biden took steps to improve recruiting, which had been lagging, and he achieved results. Trump appears to be building on that success — and he may well exceed it. But that’s not a reason to pretend that the results are entirely because of the Trump administration.\n\nTrump earns Three Pinocchios.\n\nThree Pinocchios\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles"

Despite the budget increase, the department's workforce decreased from about 4,530 employees in 2010 to around 300 fewer employees in 2024.\n\nThe department's rising budget is largely due to spending on grants, student aid, and loan programs.

Photo by Hannah Peters/Getty Images\n\nCoe revealed that the tests were not only not invasive but also \"necessary.\"\n\n\"They will be done to absolutely international medical standards,\" he continued.\n\nCoe remarked that the most difficult part of the endeavor will be to find an international provider that has the capacity to deliver large-scale tests, given that World Athletics holds events all over the world.\n\nThe governing body also said the testing would be a \"once-in-the-career\" type of test for a female athlete.\n\nA reporter asked Coe if the parameters around differences of sexual development — which deals with the classification of gender — would be updated to reflect the new rules. Coe appeared to agree that the parameters should be changed.\n\n\"It's important to do it because it maintains everything that we've been talking about and particularly recently, about not just talking about the integrity of female, women's sport, but actually guaranteeing it,\" Coe replied. \"And this, we feel, is a really important way of providing confidence, and maintaining that absolute focus on the integrity of competition.\"\n\nWhen asked if he was prepared for any legal or media resistance, Coe said he indeed is ready to take on criticisms and that he would not have set down the path to \"protect the female category in sport\" almost a decade ago if he were not prepared."

        "full_text": "Theodore Roosevelt hated the idea of unelected judges stopping him and his allies in the Progressive movement from wielding government power as they saw fit. So Roosevelt advocated stripping the courts of their independence by subjecting both judges and judicial decisions to recall by popular vote.\n\n\"When a judge decides a constitutional question,\" Roosevelt argued in 1912, \"the people should have the right to recall that decision if they think it is wrong.\" It must be \"made much easier than it now is to get rid, not merely of a bad judge,\" Roosevelt declared, but of any judge. As far as Roosevelt was concerned, the Progressive movement \"cannot surrender the right of ultimate control to a judge.\"\n\nSound familiar?\n\nDonald Trump's second presidential term is barely 3 months old, and a Rooseveltian offensive against the courts is already in full swing. Indeed, the Trump administration began attacking the independence of the judiciary almost as soon as the administration began appearing in federal court. \"When judges egregiously undermine the democratic will of the people,\" declared Elon Musk, the head of Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, \"they must be fired or democracy dies!\" \"Radical left-wing judges are egregiously trying to stop President Trump from using his core constitutional powers as head of the Executive Branch and Commander-in-Chief,\" claimed White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. \"They MUST be reined in.\"\n\nTrump at least avoided using the overtaxed word egregiously, but he did call for the impeachment of judges whose decisions he does not like. \"HE DIDN'T WIN ANYTHING!\" Trump fumed after Judge James E. Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued the order blocking Trump's deportation flights. \"I'm just doing what the VOTERS wanted me to do. This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges' I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!\"\n\nThere are many excellent reasons why Boasberg should not be impeached, including the fact that Boasberg's judgment against Trump is both persuasive and well-grounded in the law. Trump may claim that he has the unilateral authority to deport alleged criminal aliens without due process. But the administration's arguments in support of that sweeping claim fail to pass muster on multiple counts.\n\nUnder the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, \"whenever there shall be a declared war between the United States and any foreign nation or government, or any invasion or predatory incursion shall be perpetrated, attempted, or threatened against the territory of the United States, by any foreign nation or government,\" the president may direct the \"removal\" of \"all natives, citizens, denizens, or subjects of the hostile nation or government, being males of the age of fourteen years and upwards, who shall be within the United States, and not actually naturalized.\"\n\nTrump invoked that law in his March 15 proclamation ordering the \"immediate apprehension, detention, and removal\" of alleged members of the street gang Tren de Aragua, who are allegedly \"conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions against the United States…in conjunction with Cártel de los Soles, the Nicolas Maduro regime-sponsored, narco-terrorism enterprise based in Venezuela.\"\n\nExcept there is no \"declared war\" between the United States and Venezuela. And while Trump and his allies have certainly promoted the idea of a rhetorical \"invasion\" of the U.S. by unlawfully present aliens, that is merely a talking point. Such rhetoric does not alter the plain text of the Alien Enemies Act, which refers to military invasions by a \"foreign nation or government.\" As James Madison explained in his \"Report on the Alien and Sedition Acts,\" published on January 7, 1800, \"invasion is an operation of war.\" The alleged crimes of the alleged members of a nonstate street gang do not magically become \"an operation of war\" just because the president says so in the hopes of unlocking extra powers.\n\nSpeaking of James Madison, he said that the role of the judiciary was to stand as \"an impenetrable bulwark against every assumption of power in the legislative or executive.\" That description is probably as good of an explanation as any for why Trump, just like Roosevelt before him, is so eager to stop the courts from doing their job.\n\nIt is also worth noting exactly what sort of judicial rulings originally brought about Roosevelt's ire. The Rough Rider was particularly enraged by Lochner v. New York, the 1905 case in which the Supreme Court struck down a provision of New York's Bakeshop Act because it violated the right of economic liberty secured by the 14th Amendment. \"The bakeshop case,\" Roosevelt seethed, had \"usurped\" the \"deliberate judgment of the people on social and economic government policies.\"\n\nLochner did invalidate one part of a popularly enacted law. But as Alexander Hamilton noted in Federalist No. 78, \"whenever a particular statute contravenes the Constitution, it will be the duty of the judicial tribunals to adhere to the latter and disregard the former.\" In other words, the popularity of a statute—or the popularity of an executive order—has nothing to do with its constitutionality. An unconstitutional act is still unconstitutional even if lots of people support it.\n\nWhen Roosevelt attacked the courts, he did so from the political left. Trump is now doing it from the political right. Yet their respective attacks share much in common. It is a timely reminder that the independence of the judiciary remains of paramount importance no matter which political faction happens to occupy the halls of government at any given time."

        "full_text": "The losses we now face as Americans are dizzying and hard to even track, much less emotionally process — so much so that it’s easy to lose track of what’s at stake in the fight with oligarchs Elon Musk and Donald Trump: some of the greatest working-class achievements of the twentieth century.\n\nOddly for someone currently laying waste to those achievements, Trump has an instinctive grasp of how much they matter. In his quasi-State of the Union address several weeks ago, rhapsodizing eloquently about the wonders of America, he singled out the Hoover Dam — curious given his cuts to the Bureau of Reclamation, which oversees the dam, and given his clear determination to sabotage the collective accomplishments of New Deal, of which the dam is one.\n\nAnother great wonder of America that Trump mentioned in his speech was the Golden Gate Bridge, another New Deal–era creation. There again, ironies abound: that beautiful and aging bridge has structural problems, and the federal agency that has been monitoring and reporting on those issues, the National Transportation Safety Board, is also facing staff cuts by Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) — raising the alarming possibility that these structural problems could go unaddressed, leaving the bridge at risk of collapse.\n\nSpeaking of great government achievements of the twentieth century, our National Parks System (NPS) — more than eighty-five million acres of land — has long been the envy of much of the world. Even the Chinese government, no slouch at public infrastructure creation, regards it as a model. Though the specifics vary and many of the NPS cuts have been overruled by courts, Musk and Trump have been significantly slashing staff from the parks.\n\nWe constantly celebrate our great wilderness in America, from legends about the frontier to “the purple mountains’ majesty” of our national anthem to car ads that panoramically revel in the Western landscape. But the National Parks System is what has kept much of that glorious landscape from being turned into auto dealerships, coal mines, or strip malls, as it all would be if our oligarchs had their way. The National Parks have never been more popular, last year reaching a record high of 331.9 million visitors. We must protect these workers and these lands for the leisure and delight of the working class.\n\nWallace Stegner once called our national parks “America’s best idea.” You wouldn’t know it looking at our current political class, but there’s considerable competition for that title.\n\nOur Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is also the envy of the world. It grew out of the government’s malaria-prevention efforts during World War II and helped to virtually eliminate malaria, polio, and other illnesses from the United States. The CDC is also responsible for the eradication of smallpox, the only human disease we have completely eliminated.\n\nThe CDC is only one small piece of the massive federal infrastructure of medical research in the United State. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the primary funder of medical research in the United States, supporting cancer research that has saved some 3.8 million people’s lives since 1991, and cutting the number of heart attack deaths in half between 1999 and 2020. Every single American benefits from its work.\n\nThe billions in NIH funding to universities support life-saving scientific research, but also help sustain our higher education system — tremendously fragile now and far more privatized and stratified than in most wealthy countries, but still one of the best in the world, unsurpassed by any other country in the variety of subjects offered and the diversity of expertise.\n\nOur K-12 system is free to every American child, and public schools are beloved by millions of Americans who use them. Yet Trump issued an executive order to eliminate the Department of Education. The Environmental Protection Agency has provided robust and popular regulation of our air, water, and ecosystems since its founding by President Richard Nixon; Musk and Trump are decimating it. Social Security, another New Deal program, keeps millions of elderly and disabled people above the poverty line and provides 40 percent of its recipients with their sole income; that agency is in a court battle for its existence in the face of DOGE’s efforts to shut it down.\n\nPossibly unsurpassed by any other country is our federal information system. If you’ve ever tried to get concrete facts on any topic from a European government, you’ll appreciate the helpful and brilliant workers at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the National Center for Education Statistics, and countless other agencies that exist just to inform us on how our society is doing so we can figure out how to improve it. All this is on the DOGE chopping block, as are the agencies that oversee and fund libraries, museums, and archives.\n\nThe daily acts of sabotage committed by Musk upon our federal government will cause great misery and suffering; they are wrecking our constitutional system, and not in a good way. But we’re also not talking enough about the incredible achievements of our federal government, and the immense services our federal workers have long provided despite a hostile ruling class and a public sector that is notoriously stingy. Americans should be proud of what we’ve built and recognize that it’s worth restoring and expanding.\n\nWe on the Left have often failed to tell the story of what we have. One reason we know there could be socialism in America is that our government and its workers have already built and achieved so much. We are now in this position of having to mourn and protest and try to stop these losses to our public sector, without having properly articulated what that public sector has done and what it is capable of doing.\n\nMany on the Left eschew patriotism. We tend to focus more on what is lacking in our system. We don’t celebrate the immense accomplishments of the American public sector but campaign relentlessly on programs that don’t yet exist.\n\nWe talk about universal childcare, but we don’t say we know that can work because Head Start — under attack by DOGE — is already a great and successful program, producing better long-term educational outcomes for children enrolled in it. (An exception has been Bernie Sanders’s call for Medicare for All, which in one phrase conveys the idea that we have much to build on and deserve much more.)\n\nWe talk about free college, but we don’t say that we know our system can do this because thirty states already provide free community college, and the federal government already helps more than ten million more students with college tuition — another item potentially on the chopping block with Musk and Trump’s attempted elimination of the Department of Education.\n\n“Make America Great Again,” Trump has been bellowing at us for more than a decade now. What’s wrong with that phrase in and of itself? There is nothing amiss in the idea of American greatness, especially when it’s tied to concepts of collective achievement and collective betterment rather than xenophobia, narcissism, and reactionary mean-spiritedness.\n\nNow is the time to talk about what has been great about America, and to defend what its working class has achieved and deserves, against the nihilistic oligarchs who pillage for their own enrichment. Now is the time to argue that it is deeply insulting to all of us to call our government and its workers “waste”; rather, our federal government is the foundation for a society in which we build beautiful things and everyone can thrive."

        "full_text": "“We need the Court to clarify what the rules are for redistricting,” Republican Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in a statement before oral arguments Monday.\n\nLouisiana’s current map was adopted after a federal court ruled its original post-2020 census map, with just one black-majority district out of six, violated federal law. But after lawmakers added a second majority-black district, a new group of plaintiffs sued, calling the revised lines an “odious racial gerrymander.”\n\nDuring Monday’s oral arguments, several conservative justices expressed concern over whether the use of race in redistricting has gone too far. Justice Brett Kavanaugh said race-based remedies must have an “endpoint,” while Justice Neil Gorsuch questioned whether any use of race in mapmaking is inherently unconstitutional.\n\n“Certainly politics played a role in this district, but didn’t race?” Gorsuch asked attorneys for counsel opposing the drawn map. “Isn’t saying race was one consideration another way of saying race predominated? And how do we square that with the 14th Amendment’s promise that race should play no role in our laws?”\n\nMeanwhile, Obama-appointed Justice Sonia Sotomayor suggested it would be significant if the high court were to do anything substantial to voting rights precedent in a case such as this one, given that lower courts consistently kept Louisiana from adopting its post-2020 census map.\n\nPlaintiffs “have a decision by a lower court that they’re likely to succeed. They have an appeal of a temporary restraining order where that court says they’re likely to win, and we have a merits panel who looks at it and says they’re likely to win. That’s not enough to provide a good faith basis for believing that they need to comply with Section Two?” Sotomayor asked counsel for the state.\n\nLouisiana officials argued they are stuck between conflicting legal obligations and political realities, including pressure to preserve Republican power in the House, such as Speaker Mike Johnson’s (R-LA) seat.\n\n“It’s a no-win scenario,” said Louisiana Solicitor General Benjamin Aguinaga, adding that constant litigation leaves states, courts, and voters in limbo.\n\nSUPREME COURT AGREES TO WEIGH DISPUTE OVER LOUISIANA’S TWO MAJORITY-BLACK DISTRICTS\n\nSupporters of the second majority-black district argue it is warranted in part because at least a third of the state’s population is black, and therefore the state’s black residents need at least two congressional representatives. But detractors say that the consideration of race is inherently political and an affront to the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nThe high court’s decision, expected by June, could clarify how states balance race and politics in redistricting — a volatile issue with major implications for minority representation and control of Congress in future elections."

        "full_text": "Gov. Ron DeSantis generated headlines and praise over the weekend after announcing that Florida was helping Elon Musk’s DOGE efforts by “returning” nearly $900 million to the federal government.\n\n“Almost a billion dollars of your taxpayer money saved,” Musk touted.\n\nThe claim was misleading. The money DeSantis said he was “returning” was for two federal programs that Florida never asked for in the first place. One of them was more than a year old.\n\nThose details were left out of the governor’s Friday night announcement on X, which was viewed 33 million times. In the post, DeSantis said that Florida was trying “for years” to return money to the federal government, but President Joe Biden’s administration “couldn’t even figure out how to accept it.”\n\n“Today, I met with @elonmusk and the DOGE team, and we got this done in the same day,” DeSantis wrote, referring to President Donald Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency.”\n\nDeSantis included a screenshot of the top half of a governor’s office memo notifying the U.S. Treasury Department that Florida was “formally returning $878,112,000.00 in taxpayer dollars.”\n\nBut the rest of the memo — with the details of what was being returned — was not released. His spokespeople did not respond to text messages or emails asking for the entire memo.\n\nDeSantis’ announcement caught the immediate interest of legislative leaders, who are actively crafting their proposed budget for the next fiscal year. Nearly $1 billion would be a significant hole that they would potentially have to patch up.\n\nA spokesperson for Senate President Ben Albritton, R-Wauchula, said in a statement Monday that leaders asked DeSantis’ office for the details on Friday.\n\n“This morning, we inquired again and learned that the $878 million was related to unspent federal drawdown authority for two programs, refugee resettlement and carbon reduction,” the spokesperson wrote. She noted that Senate officials had received the information over the phone and not in writing.\n\nA copy of the memo obtained by the Herald/Times states that $320 million as part of Biden’s carbon reduction program was “formally rejected” by Florida’s Department of Transportation in December 2023. The state “has yet to receive confirmation” that funds have been withheld, the memo states. Only $49 million of that was given to the state, according to the memo, and was being returned to the federal government through a wire transfer.\n\nThe money was part of an Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act program to help states reduce vehicle emissions. Florida’s Department of Children and Families was also “returning” the authority to spend $557,725,139 in federal dollars on “refugee social service grant funding.” The federal Refugee Admissions Program resettles people in the United States who are unable to safely return to their home countries.\n\nDeSantis was asked for the details on Monday while campaigning in Idaho to pass an amendment to the U.S. Constitution requiring Congress to produce balanced budgets.\n\nHe said “refugee money” was returned to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. And about $350 million was to go to the U.S. Department of Transportation for road projects that were attached to “DEI and woke policies, which were totally contrary to our state’s policy.”\n\n“We had kind of led the fight against that stuff,” DeSantis said. “Now, it’s more fashionable to be against it.”\n\nDeSantis has struggled to tie himself to Musk’s DOGE efforts since the tech billionaire’s team began taking an axe to federal government spending programs in the Trump administration. DeSantis announced in February that he was forming his own DOGE team to investigate waste in state government, but further details haven’t been released.\n\nState lawmakers have since been delving into spending by his agencies and grilling DeSantis’ officials over their findings.\n\n“If the governor had really wanted to be DOGE, then the budget he submitted to us several months ago would have been DOGE,” Rep. Vicki Lopez, R-Miami, told reporters last week. “What we are finding is the Legislature is actually doing the DOGE efforts.”\n\nDeSantis also refused to return billions of dollars in federal COVID relief funding in the pandemic, despite Republicans including Sen. Rick Scott calling on states to do so.\n\nThis story was originally published March 24, 2025 at 4:31 PM."

        "full_text": "Jeffrey Goldberg may be one of the last journalists the Trump administration would want to inadvertently include on a private text thread discussing war plans. But according to Mr. Goldberg’s stunning revelation on Monday, that is exactly what happened.\n\nMr. Goldberg, 59, was a well-known national security reporter before he took over as editor in chief of The Atlantic in 2016. He was born in Brooklyn and studied at the University of Pennsylvania before dropping out and moving to Israel to serve in the Israel Defense Forces. He wrote about his time as a prison guard in 1990, during the First Intifada, for a 2006 book, “Prisoners: A Muslim and a Jew Across the Middle East Divide.” He also began a career in journalism while in Israel as a columnist for The Jerusalem Post.\n\nMr. Goldberg returned to the United States and worked as a police reporter at The Washington Post. He wrote for New York magazine and The New York Times Magazine, and became the New York bureau chief of the Jewish newspaper The Forward. In 2000, The New Yorker hired him as its Middle East correspondent, a role he held for five years before becoming the Washington correspondent.\n\nIn 2007, he was lured to The Atlantic after its owner, David Bradley, sent ponies to Mr. Goldberg’s Washington home for his three young children. He took over as its editor in chief nine years later.\n\nUnder Mr. Goldberg’s editorship, The Atlantic won its first Pulitzer Prize, in 2021, and also won one in 2022 and another in 2023. The magazine won the National Magazine Award for General Excellence in 2022 and 2023. Mr. Goldberg is also the moderator of PBS’s “Washington Week With The Atlantic.”\n\nThe magazine has been controlled by the Emerson Collective, an organization run by Laurene Powell Jobs, since it acquired a majority stake in 2017. Last year, The Atlantic announced that it was profitable and had more than one million subscriptions. It increased the number of print magazines it publishes to 12 a year, up from 10.\n\nRecently, Mr. Goldberg has been beefing up political coverage at The Atlantic, hiring several top journalists from The Washington Post. The Atlantic also announced that the MSNBC “Morning Joe” co-host Jonathan Lemire and the programmer Alex Reisner would be contributing writers.\n\nMr. Goldberg has frequently been an antagonist to President Trump. In 2020, he reported that Mr. Trump had disparaged American military members who died during service as “losers.” In 2024, he wrote that Mr. Trump continued to have disdain for the U.S. military and had said he needed “the kind of generals that Hitler had.”"

Jack Reed, D-R.I., and fellow committee Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine of Virginia, Mark Kelly of Arizona, Jacky Rosen of Nevada and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing, Phelan sought to frame his business experience as an asset to help turn around long-standing issues with Navy shipbuilding and other budget woes.\n\n\"I understand why some may question why a businessman who did not wear the uniform should lead the Navy,\" he said in his opening statement at last month's hearing. \"I respect that concern. The Navy and the Marine Corps already possess extraordinary operational expertise within their ranks. My role is to utilize that expertise and strengthen it, to step outside the status quo and take decisive action with a results-oriented approach.\"\n\nPhelan's professional background is as an investment banker. Prior to becoming Navy secretary, he was the chairman of Rugger Management LLC, an investment firm he founded. Before that, he co-founded and was managing partner of MSD Capital, the private investment firm for Michael Dell, founder and CEO of Dell Technologies.\n\nPhelan was also a major donor to Trump and Republicans in the 2024 elections. Among other political donations, he contributed $834,600 to Trump's joint fundraising committee in April, and days after the election, on Nov. 10, chipped in another $93,300, Federal Election Commission records show.\n\nHe also sat on the board of a nonprofit called Spirit of America, which, according to its website, has \"an agreement with the Department of Defense that allows U.S. troops to collaborate with us to build goodwill and deliver assistance at scale.\"\n\nWhile most senators brushed off his lack of military experience, some Democrats questioned whether his professional history presented a conflict of interest.\n\n\"Given your financial investments in defense contractors and the Trump transition's emphasis on your 'business-minded' orientation, I am concerned that you will enter this role with serious conflicts of interest,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a member of the Armed Services Committee, wrote in a letter to Phelan earlier this month urging him to make stronger divestments and recusal commitments than required by law.\n\nStill, others expressed optimism that his business experience could help the Navy finally right shipbuilding programs that have run years over schedule and billions of dollars over budget.\n\n\"You're a nontraditional appointee for this position, and that can be OK if the tradition is not working,\" Kaine said at the hearing last month.\n\nRelated: Navy Secretary Nominee, a Trump Donor with No Military Experience, Glides Through Confirmation Hearing\n\nStory Continues"

        "full_text": "Democrats were alarmed last spring and summer when polling suggested that voters ages 18 to 29 were softening in their longtime commitment to the Democratic Party. After the November election, when exit polls indicated that Kamala Harris had won the young adult vote by only a slim margin (if that), it seemed that the ground had shifted. A post-inauguration cover story in New York magazine on young Trump supporters partying it up in Washington captured a widespread impression that this was a generational realignment: the rise of a cadre of MAGA youth.\n\nAfter examining new survey data and interviewing more than 100 young adults for a book I’m writing on how politics is reshaping the college experience, I’m doubtful. Young MAGA types may feel newly energized and empowered, but empowerment is different from numerical growth. The data suggest that the swing in young adults voting for Donald Trump did not reflect a major shift in ideology. Rather, the swing seems to have resulted from moderate-to-somewhat-liberal young voters deciding to bet on Mr. Trump out of concern about the state of the economy — and from young moderates and progressives who chose to stay home because they thought Ms. Harris was either too progressive or not progressive enough. This is a point with implications for Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nThe most striking feature of the young adult Trump swing is that it occurred even though there has been no significant recent increase in the proportion of young adults who identify as conservative. Data from the Cooperative Election Study, a national survey with more than 50,000 respondents during election years, show that between 2006 and 2023, about 23 percent of Americans ages 18 to 29 identified as either “conservative” or “very conservative” on average, a number that fluctuated only modestly year to year. The 2024 numbers, which the study’s researchers have shared with me, show no meaningful departure from this pattern. (Despite fears of the influence of a misogynistic online “manosphere,” the ratio of young men to young women who identify as conservative did not change appreciably, either.)\n\nLikewise, the survey registered only modest changes in the political party affiliations of young adults over the past two decades. Young people have been softening in their commitment to the Democrats, but they’ve been softening in their commitment to the Republicans as well. In place of these loyalties a growing number say they are independents.\n\nI heard this dissatisfaction with party affiliation in my interviews. A Black woman from an immigrant family who had recently graduated from a flagship public university in the South told me she’d been frustrated by the political polarization she’d witnessed at her school, where “you’re either Democrat or you’re Republican,” she said. “It’s like hippies versus veterans.”\n\nShe took pride in not being attached to a party. Recently she’d been reading through Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s blueprint for Mr. Trump’s second presidency. She’d found some elements she disliked and others she liked — a nonpartisan reaction that she suggested ought to be more common. (As with most social science research, participants in my study remain anonymous.)\n\nThere is also not much evidence that young adults hold increasingly conservative opinions — quite the contrary. A recent study by the sociologists Kyle Dodson and Clem Brooks found that from 2012 to 2020, public opinion in the United States toward racial minorities, immigrants, people who are gay or lesbian and other groups grew more socially accepting, with young adults at the leading edge of that change. Young Republicans became more socially accepting, too, if not on every issue.\n\nThis is part of a longer-term trend. Sociologists such as Mike Hout and Ethan Fosse have demonstrated that on a wide array of social matters, including the division of household labor between men and women, the morality of homosexuality, views of corporal punishment and feelings about prayer in school, the general trend across the past century is for Americans born each successive year to express slightly more tolerant, egalitarian and secular attitudes than the one before. Although these studies don’t go all the way up to 2024, research from Gallup indicates that this development hasn’t changed course in the last few years, no matter how much chatter there is about a vibe shift.\n\nBy contrast, the evidence is strong that economic considerations mattered greatly to young Americans in the 2024 election. While voters of all age groups cited the economy as a pressing concern, this was especially true for voters under 30, with 40 percent reporting that inflation had been the single most important factor in their vote for president, and 46 percent more saying that it had been an important factor. A substantial number of young people apparently believed that Ms. Harris would continue the Biden-era policies they held responsible for high prices and hoped that Mr. Trump would bring relief.\n\nBut voting for Mr. Trump did not necessarily mean that these young people had become MAGA faithful. Responding to a survey I conducted last summer, one young woman from the West Coast, a Latina commuter student with a lot of financial aid at a large, nonselective public university, reported that though she was somewhat liberal and concerned about the environment, she was planning to cast her ballot for Mr. Trump. Her vote would be about the economy, she said — about how, under the Biden administration, people were “not able to afford basic needs.”\n\nImmigration was also an important issue for some young Trump voters — but not, it seems, in the strongly partisan way it was important for older voters. Polling in September by Harvard’s Institute of Politics found that more than a third of Americans ages 18 to 29 supported mass deportation of immigrants who were in the country illegally — yet the Pew Research Center reported in December that only 10 percent of young adults said that levels of legal immigration should be reduced. This suggests that young people tended to be motivated more by economic concerns associated with large-scale, unregulated immigration than by nationalist or xenophobic appeals, pockets of far-right support notwithstanding.\n\nThen there is the matter of young people who might otherwise have voted for Ms. Harris abstaining from voting. Many young moderates saw her as too progressive or “woke.” Many young progressives saw her as not progressive enough, especially in light of the Biden administration’s military aid to Israel. Insofar as these people stayed home on Election Day, they led to an increase in the share of the young adult vote for Mr. Trump — but not an increase in the number of young people who supported him.\n\nI’m a sociologist, not a political strategist, but I believe there are lessons here for both Democrats and Republicans. Democrats, thinking they have the wind of history at their backs, have often taken the support of young adults for granted, focusing their efforts more on getting them to the polls than earning their vote. Yet long-term social change doesn’t automatically translate into electoral success. While young people are becoming more socially progressive, more are pocketbook voters than Democrats have realized.\n\nRepublicans, for their part, should heed the limits of their mandate from young Americans, such as it is. The G.O.P.’s core base remains older white people who say they no longer recognize the country that young people are ushering into being. The more the Trump administration caters to these voters by doubling down on prayer in public schools, for example, or pursuing a national abortion ban or imposing restrictions on L.G.B.T.Q.+ rights, the more it risks alienating younger, more socially accepting voters who swung toward Mr. Trump for bigger paychecks and less expensive housing — especially if the economy falters."

Under-fire congressional leaders historically struggle to shake off intra-party criticisms, and how he handles a battle against a massive GOP plan to extend tax cuts for the wealthy and the need to recruit candidates for the 2026 midterms will be closely watched, especially by angry constituents who feel Democrats aren’t taking the moment seriously.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I think this has been a wake-up call for all of us,” Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) said Tuesday. “The base is rightly terrified about the lawlessness of the Trump administration, and I’m seeing the caucus is really internalizing that.”\n\n“We are united in understanding where we need to go. We’re still talking about some differences about how we get there,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) added.\n\nOnly a few Senate Democrats have been willing to publicly criticize Schumer’s handling of the GOP funding bill, which averted a government shutdown but did nothing to stop Trump and Musk from gutting federal agencies. (Schumer, for his part, has argued that a shutdown would have allowed Trump to close federal agencies more quickly, and for a longer period of time.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWarren, a member of Schumer’s leadership team, bluntly told constituents at a town hall last week that Schumer’s approach was “wrong,” while Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) dodged a question at another town hall about whether the New York senator should step aside, saying only that “it’s important for people to know when it’s time to go.”\n\nNo member of the Senate Democratic caucus has directly called on Schumer to step aside, as progressive groups and even a few Democratic House members suggested.\n\n“No one is really wanting to go there yet, but I think it has done real damage to him which will linger,” a Senate Democratic aide who requested anonymity to speak freely told HuffPost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemocrats are instead turning their attention to a $4 trillion tax cut package Republicans are planning to move in the coming weeks that would also cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending, including to government programs like Medicaid. The party has been far more united on issues like protecting health care coverage, organizing town halls all over the country to rally opposition and pressure Republican lawmakers to reverse course.\n\nSchumer and his caucus ultimately can’t stop the bill from passing if Republicans muster a simple majority of votes in the Senate to pass it under the so-called budget reconciliation process, which allows the majority to avoid a filibuster. They can exploit GOP divisions on the bill and make life harder for them, however, by drawing attention to the plan and making it politically painful.\n\n“We should not make anything easy,” Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) told HuffPost, calling the Democrats’ position “popular and righteous.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemocrats’ strategy will depend on what Republicans ultimately decide to include in the bill. There are a number of GOP senators who have concerns about drastically cutting Medicaid, which over 70 million Americans rely on. Other Republicans, meanwhile, want to see larger spending cuts to reduce the deficit, particularly if the bill hikes the debt limit.\n\n“The next big thing will be the debt ceiling, and you’re going to have to not only have a plan, but start to socialize it sooner rather than later,” Welch said.\n\nThe beginnings of Schumer’s strategy could be seen in an ad released last week by Majority Forward, a political nonprofit controlled by his allies, targeting Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Joni Ernst of Iowa and Dan Sullivan of Alaska. All four are up for reelection in 2026.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ad slams the senators for being under the thumb of Trump and billionaire Elon Musk. “If you’re terrified of these guys, you can’t do what’s right for Maine,” a female narrator says in the 30-second ad. “Tell Susan Collins to stop selling out our health care. Maine’s senator should have a spine.”\n\nSchumer, of course, will also be under pressure to pick winning candidates against those senators in next year’s midterm elections, which would provide Democrats real power to block Trump’s policies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn defending his skills as Democratic leader last week, Schumer said he is the “best” person for the job because of his ability to recruit candidates to run for Senate and to win elections. He pointed to the surprise 2020 Democratic takeover of the Senate, including two huge runoff wins in Georgia, what was until then a Republican stronghold. But Schumer had some misses that year as well, such as failing to oust Collins and recruiting what ended up being a flawed candidate in North Carolina.\n\nDemocrats don’t have many Senate pickup opportunities in 2026. Two of the biggest ones include again challenging Collins in Maine and Tillis in North Carolina. With Republicans currently controlling 53 seats, Democrats will need to expand the map to win back their majority.\n\nThe good news for the party is they’re likely to face a better political environment next year. Already, Trump’s handling of the economy has shaken voter perceptions of his administration, with his approval numbers dipping, particularly with independent voters. The turbulent stock market, uncertainty caused by Trump’s tariffs, and his administration’s halting of popular government services could only add to the president’s worsening public approval rating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“If we keep at it every day, relentless, fighting, and showing how they’re hurting people so badly, Trump’s numbers will get much lower, and his popularity and effectiveness will decline,” Schumer argued during an interview on “CBS Mornings” last week.\n\nBut some of those candidates may not be enthusiastic about Schumer. Mallory McMorrow, a state senator who is likely to be among the Democratic front-runners for Michigan’s Senate seat, told Politico she would not support Schumer for leader if she wins. Democratic campaign aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, said any Democrat running for Senate is preparing for a question about their Schumer support.\n\nWe Don't Work For Billionaires.

        "full_text": "Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino.\n\nPresident Donald Trump campaigned in 2024 on lowering egg prices, which increased significantly toward the end of the term of his predecessor, former President Joe Biden.\n\nWhere do prices stand now? What caused them to spike last year?\n\nHere, we answer those and other questions about the cost of the popular food item.\n\nAre egg prices going up or down?\n\nThat depends on which prices you’re talking about.\n\nIn remarks on March 16, Trump said that when he began his second term in January, the price of “eggs were through the roof,” but now “are down 35% over a short period of time.” Vice President JD Vance also talked about declining prices on March 14, saying, “Egg prices are lower than they were when we took office.”\n\nWhat neither the president nor vice president made clear is that they were referring to wholesale prices, which is how much retailers pay to farmers and other egg producers to procure eggs to sell in their stores.\n\nIn its March 14 Egg Markets Review, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said that average national wholesale prices for graded, loose, white large shell eggs declined to $4.15 per dozen – down roughly 39% from $6.85 per dozen on March 7. By March 21, average prices for those eggs, which had been as high as $8.17 on March 3, had dropped further to $3.27, the USDA said.\n\nBefore Trump took office, average wholesale prices rose from $1.07 as of Jan. 5, 2024, to $5.87 as of Jan. 17, 2025.\n\nBut during the campaign, Trump seemed to be focused on lowering prices for consumers — not retailers. So far, it’s not clear whether prices have gone down much for grocery shoppers. We won’t have March data on retail prices until April.\n\nIn February, retail prices paid by consumers were still increasing, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Last month, the nationwide average price for a dozen grade A white eggs was about $5.90 – up more than 19% from $4.95 in January, the previous average price record in the U.S.\n\nThe USDA’s March 21 report on egg markets said that, just in time for the Easter holiday, “consumers are slowly beginning to see downward price adjustments.” Although, “it remains to be seen if the recent price drops will be sufficiently reflected in store shelves to encourage price-weary consumers to not limit their holiday celebrations,” the report said.\n\nSome economists have said that retailers may not lower egg prices for consumers until current store inventories run out, or until retailers can recoup some of their lost profits.\n\nGenerally, consumer prices for eggs have been trending up since the fall of 2023. Current wholesale prices are also still higher than they have been on average in past years.\n\nWhat caused egg prices to increase?\n\nMany economists say the primary reason is the highly pathogenic avian influenza – caused by the H5N1 virus – that has been spreading among poultry, dairy cows and wild animals in the U.S. since January 2022. What is now the largest bird flu outbreak since 2015 has caused an egg shortage, as tens of millions of egg-producing hens have had to be killed to prevent further spread of the virus.\n\nAs of March 20, more than 168 million birds had been affected in total, according to USDA data. Over 30 million birds from commercial egg layer flocks have been lost in 2025 alone.\n\nThe diminished egg supply, coupled with consistently high consumer demand, led to price increases. There was a similar spike in prices in 2022 and early 2023, during the first months of the outbreak, when average retail egg prices reached a then-high of $4.82 per dozen.\n\nInflation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic played a role as well.\n\n“Inflation is another, if less dramatic, factor driving up egg prices,” Bernt Nelson, an economist for the American Farm Bureau Federation lobby, wrote in a March 11 analysis. “While inflation has slowed over the last couple of years, it’s important to remember inflation is a measure of growth. Slowing inflation doesn’t mean prices are going down, it means they are getting expensive more slowly.”\n\nOn top of making eggs more expensive in grocery stores, inflation “also raises the cost of everything it takes to produce eggs on the farm and get them on grocery store shelves,” Nelson said. That includes the cost of replacing chickens that are bred to produce eggs, he said.\n\nIs price gouging happening?\n\nFarm Action and Food & Water Watch are two advocacy organizations that have alleged that corporations are making huge profits by intentionally keeping supply low and prices high.\n\nIn a March 7 post, Farm Action said: “While avian flu has been cited as the primary driver of skyrocketing egg prices, its actual impact on production has been minimal. Instead, dominant egg producers—particularly Cal-Maine Foods—have leveraged the crisis to raise prices, amass record profits, and consolidate market power. The slow recovery in flock size, despite historically high prices, further suggests coordinated efforts to restrict supply and sustain inflated prices.”\n\nThe Wall Street Journal and others reported in early March that the Department of Justice opened an investigation to determine if egg prices were being manipulated by large producers.\n\nBut Jeremy Horpedahl, an associate professor of economics at the University of Central Arkansas, said that there is a much simpler explanation for why prices have remained high: supply and demand.\n\n“[Y]ou don’t need shadowy conspiracies of egg producers to understand the dynamics of egg-flation in the United States,” he wrote in a March 14 commentary piece for the Cato Institute. “Those same theories were trotted out in 2022–23 during the last big increase in egg prices, with many on the political left blaming a conspiracy of egg producers and corporate greed for high egg prices. That argument was wrong then, as we know, because egg prices quickly fell from almost $5 per dozen in January 2023 down to $2 per dozen in summer 2023. This change wasn’t because egg producers suddenly got less greedy: It’s because the supply shock of the major avian flu outbreaks ended.”\n\nHorpedahl continued, “All you need to explain the price fluctuations of eggs is good old supply and demand. Avian flu is the biggest challenge recently, with around 68 million egg-laying chickens being affected in the past year, with 44 million of those in just the prior three months (December 2024 to February 2025). The USDA also tells us that there are 378.5 million egg-laying chickens in the US, so over 11 percent of the total supply has been reduced in a very short time.”\n\nAnd, he said, “because so many consumers are willing to keep buying eggs as the price rises, the price has to rise a lot in response to an 11 percent reduction in supply and still have the market clear—which happens when enough buyers have decided they don’t need the good anymore.”\n\nWhat is the Trump administration doing to address high prices?\n\nOn Feb. 26, the USDA announced a $1 billion, “five-pronged strategy” focusing on biosecurity to minimize outbreaks, relief for farmers, vaccine research and regulation reductions.\n\nThe department said that up to $500 million would be used to expand wildlife security measures, including free biosecurity audits to egg-producing facilities to protect flocks from virus transmission from wild birds. The plan also calls for up to $400 million to be used to help farmers speed up the chicken repopulation process, and as much as $100 million could go to exploring potential vaccines and therapeutics that may protect chickens from future outbreaks.\n\nIn addition, the USDA said that it would explore temporarily importing egg products to increase the domestic supply. The department already has reached import agreements with Turkey and South Korea.\n\nIs the Trump administration responsible for lower wholesale prices?\n\nA White House post on March 21 mentioned several “resounding wins” that were attributed to Trump’s “economic agenda.” The first item highlighted on the list: “Wholesale egg prices dropped for the third straight week — down more than 50% since President Trump took office.”\n\nBefore that, on March 12, the president said from the Oval Office, “We have a great secretary of agriculture, and we did a lot of things that got the cost of eggs down very substantially.”\n\nBut it’s not clear that the decrease can be credited to the administration’s policies.\n\nThe USDA said in its March 14 report that wholesale prices had gone down because “no significant outbreaks” of the bird flu were reported in March, “rapidly improving” the supply situation. The report also said that high retail prices had weakened consumer demand for eggs, which also helped with store inventories.\n\nAnd when the USDA’s plan was announced last month, Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said that the administration’s strategy was not an immediate fix.\n\n“This five-point strategy won’t erase the problem overnight, but we’re confident that it will restore stability to the egg market over the next three to six months,” she wrote in a Feb. 26 opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nFurthermore, the Des Moines Register reported that, in a March 20 call with reporters, Rollins acknowledged that prices for consumers could remain high for some time.\n\n“While calling lower wholesale prices a move ‘in the right direction,’ Rollins said grocery store prices could, in fact, continue climbing, given increased demand ahead of the upcoming Easter holiday,” the newspaper said about her remarks. “In addition, she noted that the spring migration of wild birds is imminent, bringing the threat of increased bird flu outbreaks, the main reason for the egg-price runup.”\n\n“While [wholesale] prices are exponentially down, and we’re really, really encouraged by that, there’s always a possibility that prices could tick back up,” Rollins said, according to the Register."

        "full_text": "“I’m so proud and so excited by every Democrat at every single level who is getting out there,” said Malcolm Kenyatta, a vice chair of the Democratic National Committee who has criticized Sanders in the past. “This is not left versus right. This is about flight versus fight.”\n\nSanders’ advisers said that two-thirds of people who registered to attend his recent events have never come out to see him or donated to him before. Progressives view it as a new opening to pull the party in a more populist direction.\n\nBut it is worrying some moderate Democrats who fear Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez could tug the party to the left at a time when it is rudderless and turn off swing voters in the process.\n\nMatt Bennett, a vice president at the center-left group Third Way, said he is glad that the rallies are “giving people an outlet for that anger” against Trump. But he argued that “crowd size is the worst metric in American politics” and “it is important that they not repeat the mistakes that the far left has made that helped get us into this mess in the first place.”\n\nFor people in Sanders’ orbit and other liberals, the audiences he has drawn with Ocasio-Cortez mark a moment they have been waiting to arrive for years.\n\nIt’s not that Sanders’ well-worn speeches about the plight of the American worker and the rise of the billionaire class have changed. They haven’t. But the Democratic base looks like it has. In the wake of President Donald Trump’s victory, Democratic voters are furious at their own leaders, crashing their town halls and tanking their party’s approval rating in polls.\n\n“There is a very important project of transforming the Democratic Party or, frankly, bringing the Democratic Party back to its FDR-era roots,” said Rep. Greg Casar (D-Texas), the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus who has joined Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez on their tour.\n\nSanders’ advisers said the tour is, in part, an effort to point a way forward for the Democratic Party. In a memo about the rallies sent to supporters, top Sanders aide Faiz Shakir argued that the country is in the midst of a “populist revolt,” and contrasted the independent senator’s popularity in recent polls to the low approval ratings of the Democratic Party.\n\nSanders’ aides said another, more immediate goal of his “Fight Oligarchy” tour, which has included stops in Nebraska, Iowa, Michigan, Arizona and elsewhere, is to put pressure on GOP lawmakers in battleground districts to vote against cuts to Medicaid, tax cuts for the wealthy and other Republican fiscal plans.\n\nThe Sanders team has compiled the names and email addresses of people who attend the events and sent them messages via email and text encouraging them to call their members of Congress and pressure them to vote against the GOP budget blueprint. Sanders’ operation has also started to hire organizers in some of the states he has been visiting.\n\nAri Rabin-Havt, Sanders’ former deputy campaign manager, attended some of his recent rallies and said he talked to a number of people who did not back Sanders in the 2016 or 2020 presidential elections. Some told him that they had been dismayed by the lack of energy in the Democratic Party compared to 2017, when people marched in the street against Trump after his first victory.\n\n“A lot of the people I spoke to were there because they saw two leaders who represented their desire to fight,” he said.\n\nThe tour by Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, which is expected to include more stops in the coming weeks, also takes place as the progressive movement starts to look toward a post-Sanders future.\n\nSanders, who is 83, is said to not be interested in running for president for a third time in 2028, sparking anxiety on the left about what comes next. Ocasio-Cortez’s supporters have floated her as a potential future presidential candidate. Some Democrats have also encouraged her to challenge Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in the 2028 primary in New York after he enraged members of his party by voting to advance a GOP funding bill that prevented a government shutdown.\n\n“People are looking for a fighter. That’s core to who she is,” said Lauren Hitt, a former top aide to Ocasio-Cortez. “She’s never been someone who’s afraid to speak up and speak out. And I think there’s a real desire for more leaders like this.”\n\nAnd no matter what her future prospects are, she is drawing audiences now from her perch in Congress — and alongside Sanders. Joe Caiazzo, a former aide to Sanders’ presidential campaigns, suggested that he and Ocasio-Cortez’s messages are resonating in part because of the alternative in Washington.\n\n“We’re living this oligarchy right now,” he said. “Everything that Bernie believes and warned us about was on display at the inauguration when the oligarchs of this country sat in front of the Cabinet nominees.”"

        "full_text": "House Democrats are sending an early warning shot as the government’s borrowing window inches to a close: winning Democratic support for a debt-ceiling hike will come at a cost for Republicans.\n\nThe minority-party Democrats have little power to dictate the debate, but a number of conservative Republicans have long opposed debt limit increases to protest deficit spending. The dynamics could give Democrats leverage in the fight — and they say they intend to use it.\n\n“We’d want to negotiate, because we know they’ve got a lot of Freedom Caucus folks who would never vote for a debt ceiling,” Rep. Ami Bera (D-Calif.) said.\n\n“Of course we don’t want a default,” he continued. “But if they’re asking for our votes, there’s other things — like the Department of Education — that are relatively important.”\n\nRep. Pete Aguilar (Calif.), chair of the House Democratic Caucus, delivered a similar message.\n\n“We’ll have those caucus family discussions,” he said. “But I think we all subscribe to the Nancy Pelosi model that nothing should be given away for free.”\n\nThe deadline for the Treasury Department’s borrowing authority remains unclear, and GOP leaders remain confident they’ll have the time to include a debt limit increase in an emerging package of policy priorities and spending cuts at the heart of President Trump’s domestic agenda. That legislation is expected to move on a special procedural track, known as reconciliation, that would cut Democrats from the debate altogether.\n\nYet recent reports have revealed that government revenues are expected to plummet this year, partly as a result of Trump’s efforts to gut the IRS and other disruptions.\n\nThat development could accelerate the default deadline and force Republicans to pursue an alternative strategy outside of their reconciliation bill — one that would likely require Democratic buy-in.\n\nWhat that Plan B might look like, and how Democrats respond, could be the next big fight on Capitol Hill, posing huge risks for both sides.\n\nFor Republicans, who control both chambers, it would mean rallying their troops behind a proposal that’s long been unpopular within their ranks, particularly among conservatives who oppose any debt ceiling hike without huge spending cuts. By tacking the debt limit increase to the massive domestic package, GOP leaders have hoped to sweeten the deal for those deficit hawks — a plan that would fall apart if the Treasury Department hits its borrowing limit before the GOP legislation is drafted and ready to go.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, are united behind the concept of raising the debt limit, but many are sure to reject a partisan proposal that advances parts of Trump’s government-gutting agenda — the same dynamics that drove House Democrats to vote almost unanimously against a partisan GOP spending bill earlier this month.\n\nNot only that, but a number of Democrats are already warning that they’ll demand concessions from GOP leaders if Democratic votes are needed to get a debt limit hike through the lower chamber. In the earliest stages of the debate, those concessions are focused on efforts to stop Trump and Elon Musk from slashing federal programs, like those under the Department of Education and U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\n“We’re going to have to analyze it closely and see what we can horse-trade and improve,” Rep. Vicente Gonzalez (D-Texas) said. “We’d definitely need to ensure that we have the resources that we need for our districts that we’ve been advocating for for the last year, and try to renegotiate some of the cuts that they’ve made, or they’re proposing to make.”\n\nTo be sure, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) — with backup from Trump — has surprised many in Washington multiple times by muscling partisan bills through his razor-thin majority without Democratic help, including the latest spending bill and a budget resolution that would serve as a blueprint for passing Trump’s agenda.\n\nBut if he’s unable to do that in this case, he and other Republican leaders would be confronted with a big question: Do they work across the aisle on a bipartisan debt ceiling increase — one that has the best chance of passing through Congress — even if it risks alienating a far-right faction already distrustful of Johnson’s leadership style?\n\nDemocrats may also face a thorny decision: Do they join forces with Republicans to help shepherd the bill to Trump’s desk, even if it includes provisions they loathe, or oppose it at risk of being blamed for an unprecedented federal default?\n\nThe contours of the debate are similar to those surrounding the recent fight over government spending. In that battle, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) hopped the aisle to help Republicans pass a partisan GOP package. The bill was bad, Schumer said, but a government shutdown would have been worse.\n\nFor both parties, the decision may be coming soon. The Congressional Budget Office is expected on Wednesday to release its D-Day report revealing more insight about the drop-dead deadline for Congress to raise the Treasury Department’s borrowing limit or suffer a default on the nation’s debt obligations for the first time in history.\n\nThe Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC) already released its forecast on Monday, in which it estimated the government could breach its debt ceiling sometime between July and October. Projections will become more precise the closer the government is to running out of cash.\n\nThe BPC also warned of the possibility of “heightened X Date risk in early June,” citing the impact tax revenue could have on the timeline. Other factors it said could also play a role in projections include disaster relief efforts, the economy and tariff revenue.\n\n“The House put the debt ceiling increase in reconciliation, as long as it stays in there, and we get it done by July, we should be just fine,” Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), head of the House Freedom Caucus, said on Tuesday.\n\nRepublicans in both chambers have expressed optimism of adopting a budget resolution to kick off the reconciliation process next month, with some hoping to pass an eventual package during the summer. But Republican leaders in the Senate had indicated some skepticism about that timeline. And there’s still uncertainty as to whether a debt ceiling increase makes the final cut.\n\n“It’s being dealt with in reconciliation, but I don’t know if it’s gonna stay there,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) told The Hill on Tuesday.\n\n“There are really three doors,” Kennedy said. “Door number one is deal with it in reconciliation. Door number two is deal with it in a separate piece of legislation. Door number three is let America default on its debt, and door number three, as far as I’m concerned, is nailed shut.”\n\n“So, we’re down to door one and door two,” he said. “I would prefer to do it in reconciliation, but if the votes aren’t there in the form that the reconciliation bill takes, we’ll have to go to door number two.”\n\nBut a “clean” bill raising or suspending the debt ceiling could be a hard sell for some in the House GOP as many continue to sound alarm over the nation’s $36 trillion-plus debt.\n\n“The bottom line is, debt ceilings have done us no good, and what you got to do is you’re going to have to reduce your spending,” Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) told The Hill.\n\nRep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) also told The Hill on Tuesday that he is “not overly inclined to be supporting a clean debt ceiling increase.”\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

        "full_text": "President Donald Trump ended federal DEI programs.\n\nEven before, companies were having second thoughts.\n\nVictoria's Secret changed \"Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\" to \"inclusion and belonging.\"\n\nNow, even woke Disney, despite squandering 270 million shareholder dollars on a moronic new version of \"Snow White,\" joined the mob of companies dropping DEI programs.\n\nWhy? Diversity, equity and inclusion sound good.\n\nThe problem is that DEI programs were captured by activists who obsess about victimhood. They divide people more than they empower.\n\n\"Diversity, equity and inclusion,\" says activist Robby Starbuck in my newest video, \"don't mean what they pretend to mean.\"\n\nBefore Trump ended federal DEI programs by executive order, Starbuck ended them at some companies merely by using the power of speech. His strategy: warn companies that he'll tell his social media followers what stupid things they do.\n\nRemarkably, that worked!\n\nAfter he criticized John Deere on Twitter for encouraging \"preferred pronouns\" and holding woke diversity trainings, John Deere quickly dropped those policies.\n\nToyota, Target and Harley Davidson did, too.\n\n\"Why did they listen to you?\" I ask.\n\n\"We go to them like any other investigative journalist and we say, 'Hey, we have a story we're working on.'\"\n\nThen, if they don't change their policies, he goes public -- posting the policies and his criticism on YouTube, Twitter, etc.\n\nOne week after he posted that Toyota sponsored pride parades and divided workers into identity-based groups such as LGBT, Black and Christian, Toyota stopped sponsoring LGBTQ events and opened employee groups to all workers.\n\nCoors has been requiring DEI trainings and donating to pride events. All it took was Starbuck looking into the company, and they stopped.\n\nSo did Jack Daniels, McDonald's, Walmart, AT&T, Lowe's and Ford.\n\n\"I like diversity,\" I tell him, suggesting DEI programs were good.\n\n\"They sound warm and fuzzy,\" says Starbuck. \"It's why at the beginning, it got a lot of buy-in ... I want to include everybody. I don't want to be mean. What it actually turned out to be in reality looked more like crazy trainings, overtly racist hiring practices, diametrically opposed to the very warm, fuzzy sounding words they try to sell.\"\n\nI think private companies should be able to have whatever policies they want. Customers and workers can buy other products or work someplace else.\n\nBut over the past few years, DEI mandates became so prevalent, you couldn't avoid them.\n\nI'm a Chase Bank customer. The bank is run by a very smart guy, Jamie Dimon.\n\nJust last year, Dimon said DEI is \"good for business; it's morally right; we're quite good at it.\"\n\nBut after Starbuck revealed JPMorgan's policies, Dimon quickly changed his mind.\n\n\"I saw how we were spending money on some of this stupid s--t,\" Dimon said, \"and it really pissed me off ... I'm just going to cancel them. I don't like wasted money in bureaucracy.\"\n\nIn my years of reporting, I've never seen changes this fast.\n\nDEI activists are angry about it.\n\nThe president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation says, \"We will not be erased!\"\n\n\"What existed before DEI?\" replies Starbuck. \"Did black people not exist before that?\"\n\nOn \"The View,\" host Sunny Hostin claims, \"This will specifically harm women ... African Americans and Latinos.\"\n\n\"What she's actually saying is that minorities are not going to be able to get jobs if the sole thing you're looking at is merit. The way I was raised, you call that racism,\" replies Starbuck. \"She's being racist.\"\n\nI push back:\n\n\"They're just saying, 'We have a history of disadvantage. We were slaves in this country.'\"\n\n\"None of them were,\" he points out. \"I'm Cuban. I could say my family went through this and that. I didn't go through it. I'm not going to claim their disadvantage as my own.\"\n\n\"We're not going to fall for the same stupid stuff anymore. We're going to judge people based on merit.\"\n\nEvery Tuesday at JohnStossel.com, Stossel posts a new video about the battle between government and freedom. He is the author of \"Give Me a Break: How I Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artists and Became the Scourge of the Liberal Media.\""

        "full_text": "LOADINGERROR LOADING\n\nGov. Patrick Morrisey signed a law Monday that will ban several food dyes and preservatives statewide in 2028.\n\nSchools will also not be allowed to serve foods with the banned additives starting in August 2025. There are at least another 20 states considering similar restrictions, but this bill is the first of this magnitude to be passed, according to The New York Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe following dyes will be banned: Blue No. 1, Blue No. 2, Green No. 3, Yellow No. 5, Yellow No. 6, Red No. 40 ― and Red No. 3 (which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned in January). It also includes two preservatives: Propylparaben and butylated hydroxyanisole, or BHA.\n\n“West Virginia ranks at the bottom of many public health metrics, which is why there’s no better place to lead the Make America Healthy Again mission,” said Morrisey in a statement Monday, referring to a movement (and Super PAC) led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\n“By eliminating harmful chemicals from our food, we’re taking steps toward improving the health of our residents and protecting our children from significant long-term health and learning challenges,” he continued. “Today’s announcement represents a step toward a productive dialogue about how West Virginia and our country can eat healthier and address some of the vexing health care problems facing our citizens.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdam Burkhammer, a Republican state delegate who is the primary sponsor of the bill, repeated similar sentiments in a statement to HuffPost.\n\n“I am excited to see West Virginia taking the lead in improving the quality of our food supply across the country. This is a major step in dealing with chronic illness and ‘Making America Healthy Again,’” Burkhammer said. “This will have a lasting impact for generations to come. I look forward to all the states following and making the health of their communities a priority.”\n\nAs NBC News has reported, the movement to ban artificial dyes is gaining traction across the country. It has been around for decades, though not explicitly under the MAHA moniker, but has made waves in recent years in line with the pandemic, anti-vaxxers and the spread of misinformation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn recent years, California has also banned food additives on a state level and in in schools. Moreover, certain countries, particularly in Europe, also already have their own various restrictions on food additives.\n\nKennedy Jr., who now oversees the FDA in his current role, has emphasized to food industry leaders that he wants to eradicate artificial color additives in foods before he ends his term as HHS Secretary.\n\nWe Don't Work For Billionaires. We Work For You.\n\nBig money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

In the case of a new color additive, the FDA determines if there is ‘a reasonable certainty of no harm’ under the color additive’s proposed conditions of use.”"

John Cornyn posted on the social media platform X. “Shameful.”\n\nCrockett suggested Tuesday that she was not referring to Abbott’s condition. Instead, she posted on X that she was referring to Abbott’s policy of sending thousands of immigrants who were in Texas illegally to cities where local policy limits cooperation with federal immigration authorities, such as New York and Philadelphia.\n\n“I was thinking about the planes, trains, and automobiles he used to transfer migrants into communities led by Black mayors, deliberately stoking tension and fear among the most vulnerable,” the post stated.\n\nAbbott’s office did not immediately replied to requests for comment.\n\nCrockett has faced criticism from Republicans for suggesting last week that tech billionaire Elon Musk, heading the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, “be taken down.”\n\n————————————-\n\nBeaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa."

        "full_text": "Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts\n\nIt’s happened to the best of us. We mistakenly send a text about a colleague we are mad at to that very colleague. We accidentally include our mom on the sibling text chain about our mom. Today on Radio Atlantic, a much higher-stakes texting error: The Atlantic’s editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, received a connection request on Signal from a “Michael Waltz,” which is the name of President Donald Trump’s national security adviser. Two days later, he was added to a group text with top administration officials created for the purpose of coordinating high-level national-security conversations about the Houthis in Yemen. On March 15, Goldberg sat in his car in a grocery-store parking lot waiting to see if the strike would actually happen. The bombs fell. The text thread had to be real.\n\nWe talk with Goldberg about this absurd chain of events, and with Shane Harris, who covers national security for The Atlantic, about what it means that defense officials were discussing detailed war plans on a text chain.\n\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\n\nHanna Rosin: On March 15, the U.S. began a bombing campaign against Houthi groups in Yemen. A couple of hours before that, our editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, sat in his car in a supermarket parking lot, waiting to see if and when the attack would start. How he knew about this military campaign is a very weird story. Not long ago, Jeff was added to a text chain of very important people in the administration. Presumably, he was added to it by accident.\n\nI know, it happens to the best of us—but there was the editor of The Atlantic monitoring the back-and-forth between Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President J. D. Vance, and others, wondering: Could this possibly be real? In fact, Brian Hughes, the spokesman for the National Security Council, later confirmed that it was indeed all real. I’m Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic, and today, we have on the show editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg and staff writer Shane Harris, who covers national security, to explain what happened and what it might mean.\n\nJeff, welcome to the show.\n\nJeffrey Goldberg: Hey, Hanna.\n\nRosin: Hi, Shane.\n\nShane Harris: Hi.\n\nRosin: Jeff, on Tuesday, March 11, you get a Signal message from a user identified as Michael Waltz, which is also the name of President Trump’s national security adviser. Where are you when you get this message, and what are you thinking?\n\nGoldberg: Weirdly and randomly, I was in Salzburg, Austria, and what I’m thinking is not much, because in my line of work, that wouldn’t be the craziest thing to happen.\n\nRosin: Like, it could be him; it could be someone pretending to be him. You’re not that fussed.\n\nGoldberg: Well, I am always cautious about people reaching out across social media or messaging apps.\n\nI don’t assume that they’re the person that the name suggests, but I would have to say that I was glad, also, and I was hoping that it was the actual Michael Waltz, because I’d like to be in regular contact with Michael Waltz for all the obvious journalistic reasons.\n\nRosin: Right. So you’re like, Oh, maybe he has a scoop for me.\n\nGoldberg: Yeah.\n\nRosin: Okay, so then what happens next? You’re going about your life, going about your business, and …\n\nGoldberg: And then I get added to a group, a Signal group—you know, a text-messaging chat group—called “Houthi PC small group.” PC I know from covering White House issues, you know: “Principals Committee,” basically the top leaders of Cabinet departments generally associated with national-security issues, and then a message from Mike Waltz talking about how he’s putting together this PC small group to talk about the Houthis, because something’s gonna be happening over the next 72 hours. That’s when I sort of think—I mean, honestly, the first thing I thought was: I’m really being spoofed. Like, somebody is—this is a hoax. This is a state or nonstate actor, probably nonstate actor, looking to entrap, embarrass, whatever word you wanna use, a journalist.\n\nRosin: Right. So you’re on alert. Like, it’s a little bit interesting, but also …\n\nGoldberg: Hanna, as you know, I’m always on alert.\n\nRosin: Yeah, okay, okay, okay.\n\nGoldberg: Hanna, what am I gonna tell you?\n\nRosin: All right, so then, so maybe it’s a spoof, maybe it’s not. How does it start to get more real?\n\nGoldberg: Well, it gets real in the sense that if somebody’s doing a spoof, it’s a very, very accurate spoof. What happens is, a number of Cabinet-level officials start reporting into this chain, giving the names of their deputies or contact people over the weekend, when, clearly, something’s gonna happen in Yemen. Uh, in retrospect, clearly something’s gonna happen in Yemen. And that was that for that day; it was the next day that they start engaging in a policy discussion really in earnest. And it’s, you know, explicated in the story that I wrote. But, um, that’s when I’m sort of thinking to myself, If this is a simulation or this is a fake, someone’s going to a huge, huge length to make it seem real, because everybody in the chat sounds like the person who they’re quote-unquote playing. So I don’t say I’m 50–50; I’m still 60, 70, you know, 70–30 this is a fakery, because, for the simple reason that this is nuts—I mean, obviously why, why would I be involved in this?\n\nRosin: I wouldn’t even know what to think, because yeah, like, we include people on text chains who we shouldn’t. Like, the mistake seems as implausible as the reality—like, every version seems implausible.\n\nGoldberg: We all make the mistake. This is why this is so relatable. Yeah. We all … I’m thinking of Shane, and I’m writing to Hanna about Shane—an assignment, or how great Shane is. And I type in Shane into the recipient, because that’s the name that’s on my mind.\n\nI don’t know what was going on in Mike Waltz’s mind, who he was thinking of—we’re trying to figure that out, still trying to figure that out. But in any case, I was added to this group, and it’s a misdirected email or text chain that I shouldn’t have been on. But the larger point—and obviously Shane can speak to this—the larger point is that: Why is this conversation happening out in the open? Now, I know Signal is end-to-end encrypted, but it’s a commercial texting service that anyone, not just people with security clearances in the federal government, can join.\n\nSo, so, and that’s the essential danger, and that’s, if you want to think about it, an original sin. The original sin is communicating very sensitive information in a channel where you can mistakenly bring in—I mean, forget the editor of The Atlantic. You could have brought in a Houthi, for all you know. You could bring in somebody who is actively sympathetic to the Houthis and sharing real-time information with you. That’s somewhat appalling.\n\nRosin: So, Shane, I’m gonna ask you about that in a second, but I need one more part of the story before we move on to that. Give me an example of—you said it sounded like them. Like, if it was a simulation, it was an amazing simulation. Can you give us an example?\n\nGoldberg: Sure: Pete Hegseth writing an all-caps about how he finds the Europeans pathetic. J. D. Vance sounding like a kind of quasi-isolationist, talking about: Why would we do this sort of thing? Europe doesn’t—Europe should take care of this problem; it’s not our problem. Trade conversations. The most interesting one, and the one that I thought, Whoa, that really does sound like the guy: At the end of this chain, Stephen Miller, or I should say “S M,” a person identified as “S M,” comes in and basically shuts the conversation down and said, I heard the president. He was clear to me; he wants to do this. It was basically—and obviously this is really interesting—it’s a conversation with not only the secretaries of state, treasury, and defense, but the vice president of the United States, and here comes Stephen Miller, deputy chief of staff, ostensibly just deputy chief of staff, coming in and saying, Uh, everybody, uh, the president spoke. I heard it. Y’all need to just stop doing what you’re doing. And then everybody kind of gets in line and, like: All right, well I guess we’re attacking Yemen.\n\nRosin: It’s so crazy that you’re just watching this conversation unfold.\n\nGoldberg: Look, the White House has confirmed that this is an authentic chain, but we’re still trying to figure out some aspects of it. I still don’t know the identities of one or two people, because they had their initials. So when we talk about them, I’m assuming that “S M” is Stephen Miller, but I’m not guaranteeing that to you.\n\nThat’s a good example of one person. On the other hand, obviously, the one called “Hegseth” is Hegseth.\n\nRosin: So you heard Vance disagree with the president, which almost never happens publicly. That’s interesting.\n\nGoldberg: I mean, to be fair to all vice presidents and presidents, it never happens in any administration, where a vice president is gonna go out and, I mean, of course he didn’t go out here. He thought he was—actually, it’s really, it’s interesting, because Vance is saying in the conversation: I don’t think the president understands the ramifications of what he’s doing. He’s saying that to people who work for the president. It’s kind of a bold move, to say: Trump doesn’t understand what’s going on. And now if I’m just sort of—this is just speculation—but if I’m Stephen Miller, and I’m reading that, and I’m the enforcer, I’m like: Okay, thanks, J. D. That’ll be enough of that.\n\nRosin: Right, right, right, right, right. So some of the things are, like, overheard across the bathroom stall—you don’t hear them in public. Other things are, like, exactly as you expect.\n\nGoldberg: Right, right, right. Other things are exactly as I expect. I mean, even later in the story, when, after the first successful strike on the Houthis in Yemen—\n\nRosin: And that’s when you know this was real.\n\nGoldberg: Well, then I know it’s real, because I was told beforehand that it was gonna happen, in my phone, and then two hours later it happens.\n\nThat’s pretty good proof that, you know, if somebody is spoofing this, then it’s not some media-gadfly organization. It’s a foreign intelligence service that had knowledge of the U.S. strikes—seems implausible. But then the part that really struck me as very Trump administration was the sharing of all these emojis: flag emojis, muscle emojis, fire emojis.\n\nRosin: Prayer emoji.\n\nGoldberg: Prayer emoji, which, you know, and it’s like, by the way, I mean, it was—talk about relatable. It’s like every workplace—I mean, this is what I actually thought when I’m seeing this come over the phone, is Wow, every workplace is the same. It’s like, Big victory! We got the new, you know, the Dunder Mifflin contract, and, you know, muscle emoji, and it’s like, here was, you know, We took out some Houthis! Good, good, good work, everybody. So that’s when I thought, Wow, these guys are—these could be these guys. Because if I were trying to spoof them, I wouldn’t do something so implausible as to start inserting juvenile emojis into a national-security conversation.\n\nRosin: Unless you were so good.\n\nGoldberg: Yeah, no, if I had outfoxed myself, you know. I wouldn’t have done that if I were doing a simulation.\n\nRosin: One more question about your reality: As all this is happening and you’re starting to realize this might be real, are you talking to people about it? Are you in your own reality about it? Are you, like, where are you?\n\nGoldberg: Well, I’m talking to certain colleagues, including and especially Shane, who’s sitting next to me. Shane, who’s been covering the intelligence community for a long while. And, you know, I’m talking to him from the beginning about this, ’cause I do need some reverb, some reaction to it, ’cause it’s never, I’ve never seen this kind of thing or heard of something like this happening.\n\nBut when I first showed him just the initial foray—you know, the “we’re having a group”—Shane was like, No, no. Somebody’s trying to—this is an operation. I don’t know who it is, I don’t know why they’re doing it, but this is an op. This is a disinformation operation, because these guys don’t do that.\n\nRosin: Okay, Shane: “These guys don’t do that.” Why was that your first thought? What don’t they do?\n\nHarris: I mean, what they do is talk about who we’re gonna bomb and why should we bomb them. They don’t do it on Signal. And, I mean, in the initial presentation of this that Jeff gave to me, I thought: Well, this, this sounds crazy. Why would they be that reckless? Why would the national security adviser set up a group, call it, you know, PC Houthi group, and then start adding these people?\n\nAnd it was actually kind of baffling, too, because, again, if this was a hoax, somebody was going to really great lengths to do it—which could happen.\n\nGoldberg: I mean, you know, sophisticated operations do happen in the intelligence world.\n\nHarris: Then the question was, of course: Why? To what end? So where is this going? And then as it went on, I think it became, like, as Jeff said, increasingly clear that the needle was moving quickly towards authentic. But my initial reaction as to why it was probably not real was: I couldn’t imagine senior national-security officials deciding that it was a good idea to discuss something of this sensitivity where, let’s be clear, pilots are in the air, they could be shot down, people could be killed, people are going to be killed on the ground—things are happening very fast. Why would you not do that in the Situation Room or in a secure facility? Many of these Cabinet officials, by the way, have facilities like that in their house. They can go have those conversations.\n\nGoldberg: Most of the relevant ones, the heads of intelligence agencies, the, obviously, defense secretary and the like, they have plenty of ways to communicate with each other within a minute or two of needing to.\n\nRosin: Even though Signal’s encrypted?\n\nHarris: Yeah. So the problem is this. There’s a couple problems. One, it’s encrypted, but it’s never been approved by the government for sharing classified or what’s called national-defense information. Now, to be clear, we talked to former security officials, former U.S. officials, who said, Yeah, we did use Signal in the government. We might use it to transmit sort of, um, certainly unclassified, not sensitive information. We might talk around something or, like, notify someone that you’re leaving a particular country. But this level of specificity—actual planning for an ongoing operation, the sharing of intelligence and information about strikes—that is clearly not what Signal’s intended for.\n\nIt’s very convenient, and it is relatively safe. I mean, I know, like, some officials who’ve traveled overseas in conflict zones who use it because they’re not near a U.S. embassy, let’s say, but it’s not meant for this kind of detailed planning which occurs as, you know, Mr. Waltz said, at the principals-committee level—that is done in the Situation Room, or that’s done at their various, you know, buildings where these people work.\n\nRosin: Just so I’m clear, what level of detail crosses the line? I know you don’t wanna say what they actually said about the campaign, but what kinds of details when you saw them were like: That would never happen.\n\nHarris: So details like the number of aircraft that are involved, the kinds of munitions that are being dropped, specific times—\n\nRosin: That was on the chain?\n\nHarris: Specific targets on the ground, um, you know, intelligence-related matters relating to the strike and to the targets, names of individuals—of U.S. officials—who should not have been put in an unclassified chain because of their status as intelligence officers. You know, you can kind of, like, you can—there’s probably six or seven different kinds of information that are arguably implicated under the rules and the law for how you’re supposed to handle this stuff.\n\nGoldberg: By the way, a lot of it is just common sense. I mean, you read something, and you could tell the difference between strategic information and tactical information. We should deal with the Houthis—fine, right? We should deal—we should do X, Y, and Z, because the Houthis are a threat to commerce and American national-security interests.\n\nThis is what we’re gonna do to the Houthis in two hours is not information that the public should have. I mean, even as a reporter I say that, and, like, I’m fascinated. I want to know how they’re making decisions, why they’re making decisions. I wanna know after action why things happened, why they went right, why they went wrong, and so on.\n\nBut I don’t want—and I’ve been doing this for a while, as has Shane—I don’t want information before a kinetic action, before a strike of some sort that has to do with the practical aspects of that strike, information that if it got into the wrong hands could actually endanger the lives of Americans.\n\nI mean, the north star for me and Shane and most normal people, normal reporters, is: Look, we don’t want to endanger the lives of American personnel in the field. And that’s why this was—that’s why the Saturday texting, the Saturday chain, was very, very different than the Friday: because it got very practical.\n\nRosin: When was the bombing campaign?\n\nGoldberg: Saturday the 15th. The first bombs exploded in Yemen around 1:45 p.m. eastern time. I found out at 11:44 eastern time that it was happening.\n\nRosin: Got it. So just so I understand, it’s like, they’re revealing specificity of plans which are about to take place, which could put lives in danger, yes?\n\nGoldberg: Okay, like, so here’s the thing that crossed my mind all throughout this, which is: Imagine if it weren’t me in that chain. But imagine if it were somebody—I mean, this sounds implausible, but it’s also implausible to include me in the chain—imagine it was somebody who was a Houthi.\n\nHarris: Or an Iranian diplomat.\n\nGoldberg: Or an Iranian diplomat, or a diplomat from another country who was a side deal with the Iranians. They literally would’ve known when things were going to happen.\n\nRosin: But I have to say: A journalist is no less dangerous. ’Cause you could have published those plans. So you’re not the best choice either.\n\nGoldberg: Um, well, I, I’m the—yes.\n\nRosin: Of journalists, you’re an excellent choice.\n\nHarris: I mean, a less scrupulous one—\n\nRosin: But a less scrupulous journalist.\n\nGoldberg: No, no, I mean, and I’m sure there are journalists who disagree with my view, who take a kind of, I would call it nihilistic view, which is, like: Information is information; we should just put it all out there.\n\nRosin: Right.\n\nGoldberg: And damn the torpedoes. I’m not—that’s not my thing.\n\nHarris: There’s another reason why this was so dangerous that doesn’t have, doesn’t involve mistakenly adding a journalist to the thread. And that is that while Signal—I mean, you said it’s end-to-end encrypted; it’s very good and secure that way. That’s true. But the device that it’s on, right, is your phone. And while the iOS system is pretty good, nation-states—and here I’m talking about China in particular, which, remember, is behind a recent, you know, penetration of the telecom networks called Salt Typhoon—the phone in the pocket of every one of those national-security officials must be presumed to be a No. 1 target for a foreign intelligence service.\n\nRosin: Mm-hmm.\n\nHarris: And there are kinds of malware that they could get implanted on that phone. There could be very expensive, very sophisticated stuff that could allow them to read the messages on the phone as they’re being typed. That’s why a system like Signal, even though it’s good end-to-end encryption, is not approved for sharing classified information. ’Cause it’s on your phone, which can be hacked.\n\nRosin: Right. So it’s obviously sloppy, reckless. Does it violate any laws?\n\nHarris: So there are a couple that it might. Conceivably, it could violate the Espionage Act, which, despite the name, it’s not just about spying; it’s about the handling of what’s called national-defense information. So if this is considered national-defense information, there are provisions of that law governing how you transmit it, who’s allowed to have it—P.S. Someone like Jeff, who doesn’t have a security clearance? Not allowed to have it. So now these officials made this known to someone who wasn’t cleared—inadvertently, so that could be, you know, a mitigating piece of information. There’s also a provision of the Espionage Act that governs what’s called gross negligence in the handling or, more precisely, the mishandling of classified information. This was the provision that the Justice Department looked at when deciding whether to charge Hillary Clinton for using a private email server, and ultimately they did not, and this provision of the law has only, to my knowledge, been successfully used once to prosecute someone. Because it’s ambiguous—what do you mean by “gross negligence”? Was it grossly negligent to put it on Signal? Was it grossly negligent to add Jeff ? The commonsense reaction to that might be yes. So that’s possible that that could, you know, implicate maybe Mike Waltz or Pete Hegseth, even under the law. And then there’s also the Presidential Records Act and the Federal Records Act.\n\nAnd in this case, I think these text messages are both federal records and presidential records, because they’re coming out of the White House in some cases. And the law says—\n\nGoldberg: Literally, one of the participants is the elected vice president of the United States.\n\nHarris: And another is the White House national security adviser. And we quoted an expert in the story, an expert on these laws, who said: Look, you know, if it’s a presidential record, you have to maintain it. And what that means is, in this case, a backup of these messages would need to be sent to some kind of government official account. If they were doing that, then they’re complying. But there are also DOD regulations about not putting classified information on an unclassified system, as clearly happened here as well.\n\nSo you’ve got a couple of laws, maybe two or three laws, provisions of those laws and regulations, that this activity would seem to violate.\n\nRosin: Well, Jeff, congratulations. You’re now part of the official Trump record—government official record. Okay, theories. I know you don’t know why this happened. Is there some possibility they wanted you to know? Have you run that through your head?\n\nGoldberg: Oh, yeah. I ran all the possibilities through my head. You know, the funny thing is, when they’re having their policy conversation—policy disagreements—I was struck by the sophistication of the arguments. Some were, you know, sort of knee-jerk, anti-Europe kind of invective that one expects, but they were having a serious conversation about what to do about a challenging problem—a problem, by the way, they were left with by the Biden administration, which did not handle that situation well or adequately.\n\nSo they were, this is something they inherited, and they’re trying to work their way through it. As they were doing that, I was thinking to myself, Oh, maybe they want me to see this. So I write a story about how clever they are in dealing with the Houthis. And I thought, That’s very kind of a circular way of getting somebody to write something about—\n\nHarris: Like, Waltz could just call you. He has your number.\n\nGoldberg: They could just call me and say, I’d like to do an interview with you about our Yemen policy, and I’d be like, Great, let’s do it. So I couldn’t, I can’t—you know, Occam’s razor explains a lot of the world, and the explanation here is that it was heading into the weekend; they were out and about; things were happening in the Middle East that they had to stay in touch with; they have these amazing devices in their pockets, like we all do, where they can communicate with the world; they put together a group; they put it together sloppily; and they did it on something that they shouldn’t have done but for convenience; and, uh, that’s it. That’s what happened.\n\nRosin: So given that that can happen to the best of us and does happen to all of us all the time, is there—\n\nGoldberg: You’re always, you’re always planning the bombings of countries on your phone with your podcast team.\n\nRosin: I mean, like, adding the wrong person to a text chain. So given that that happens to the best of us, can you draw any particular conclusions about the Trump administration? Like, does it reveal anything to you about them that’s specific, as opposed to just, you know, they’re sloppy like the rest of us?\n\nHarris: I think there’s that aspect too, which, I mean, there is a little bit of a Who among us?, right? We’ve all done this—I mean, not about planning a war—but we know what this is like and how embarrassing and unintentional it can actually be. But what I do think this shows is a level of recklessness. There’s just no world in which a reasonable person serving these positions would think it’s okay to discuss this kind of active operation, I think, in this way. Now, there may be people who would challenge me on that, and there may be people who would say, Listen, it’s not as bad as it looks; they weren’t getting into totally the operational weeds—even though I think they actually were. You could make excuses for that, but just as a judgment matter, this was a bad one. It was a bad call, I think, to use Signal in this way. It’s not approved for this way. And you can see why it was such a bad call, because a horrible accident like this, from their perspective, can happen. But what I also think it reveals, too—and this is important to the policy debate—is there is not agreement in the administration over whether they’re doing the right thing with this action. There is widespread agreement, it seems, that they should make the Europeans try to pay for this military action, ’cause it’s mostly European goods that are moving through this part of the world. But when the vice president comes out and says, I disagree, and I don’t think that the president understands the implications for this and how it will affect his foreign policy—that’s quite striking.\n\nAnd you see in the messages how they’re referring back to previous meetings that they had where it seemed to some people in the room like this issue was settled. But apparently it wasn’t. And they go on this kind of extended debate about: Well, should we wait a month? And then Stephen Miller, as Jeff said, comes in and says, No, the president said we’re doing this.\n\nAnd so you see that there’s not clarity around the president’s decision making around the policy, and that is just—to be a fly on the wall for that is extraordinary. That’s very revealing about the policy process in this White House.\n\nRosin: You mean for such an important decision that there are last-minute disagreements that haven’t been buttoned up, that haven’t been hashed out, that haven’t gone through proper channels or, you know, like, thoughtfully resolved?\n\nGoldberg: I think they were—I mean, apart from the fact that they were doing it on an insecure channel in the presence of the editor in chief of The Atlantic magazine—apart from those two technical issues, they were having a reasonable conversation that you would expect them to have.\n\nAnd like I said, I was a little bit heartened that, Oh—they actually debate among themselves. They talk about this; they work through these things. They seem to be—as Shane pointed out, this is obviously the residue from other meetings that were taking place live and in person, where they’re still working out issues.\n\nWhat I found—maybe just on a personal level or a, you know, a citizen level—disconcerting was when “S M,” who we assume is Stephen Miller or presume is Stephen Miller, when he comes in and says, Nah, I didn’t hear that. I heard the president say, “We’re doing it.” Thank you very much. Call it a day. And then everybody—\n\nHarris: And no one disagrees.\n\nGoldberg: And then everybody, including the secretary of defense, goes: Agree.\n\nBut I have to say, and I want to be very clear here, when I understood that this was real, I did remove myself from the group and began the process of writing this so that I could make the public aware, our reading public aware, that this government had, um, let’s just say poor digital hygiene. So it’s a very serious thing and I would rather not be engaged in that kind of text chain.\n\nRosin: Well, Jeff, Shane, thank you for joining us today.\n\nHarris and Goldberg: Thank you."

        "full_text": "Philip Lane, chief economist of the European Central Bank, recently expressed urgency for the need to develop a digital euro—also known as a central bank digital currency (CBDC)—to compete against stablecoins such as Tether and electronic payment systems developed by U.S. tech firms, such as Google Pay and Apple Pay. Not content with eliminating cash, now the goal of central banks is to eliminate any competing electronic payment system.\n\nWe're sleepwalking into a world with digital currencies without any government coercion whatsoever. As a 51-year-old Generation Xer, I carry lots of cash in my wallet. I teach personal finance at the local university and recently asked a class of about 30 students if any of them had any cash. Not one of them had a single bill or coin on them. They use debit cards, credit cards, Venmo, and Apple Pay. As it turns out, cash usage among the 18–24 age cohort has declined from 28 percent to 13 percent over the last five years. Most like the convenience of electronic payments, even though studies show that people spend 12 percent to 18 percent more when using credit cards than cash. If the government does attempt to implement a digital dollar, there will be little resistance to it.\n\nCurrently, there is $2.36 trillion in U.S. currency in circulation. Of course, much of this is held outside our borders, owing to the dollar's dominance as the global reserve currency. The most common denomination of U.S. currency is the $100 bill. There are more $100 bills in circulation than $1 bills. Many residents of foreign countries, such as Argentina, consider the U.S. dollar to be a store of value and a hedge against inflation and local currency depreciation. If the U.S. government ever decided to phase out paper currency, it would have far-reaching effects around the globe.\n\nPromoters of a digital currency allege that it would cause a drop in criminal and illicit activity. That may be correct, or people may simply resort to another medium of exchange or barter. Philosophically speaking, virtue is not possible without the freedom of choice. If people can't choose to misbehave, it does not make them virtuous. A society in which nobody has the freedom to misbehave is far more horrifying than a society where people actually misbehave.\n\nCash is anonymous. Just because one isn't doing anything illegal doesn't mean one wants the government to know where they go to lunch every day. If you have a complete electronic record of someone's economic activity, you have a pretty good idea of who they are as a person, which is why economic privacy is so important.\n\nFar more sinister than the desire to socially engineer good behavior is the potential for central banks to implement stimulative monetary policy using negative interest rates. Cash pays no interest. Interest rates are off the pre-pandemic lows, so today, it is not hard to find a bank that pays a decent interest rate on a savings account. But in the 2010s, interest rates were zero for about a decade, and central planners believed they could reverse deflation by setting interest rates at negative levels. Negative interest rates mean that your money in the bank loses value over time. Naturally, people would withdraw their money in the form of cash, because zero interest is better than negative interest, but if cash didn't exist, people would be forced to spend the cash in the bank before it lost value. Since we're now dealing with inflation rather than disinflation, these talks have mostly dried up, but negative rates could be attempted at some point in the future.\n\nOf course, any income received in the form of cash is invisible to the IRS and cannot be taxed. The informal economy accounts for about 7 percent of gross domestic product in the United States, which is low, relative to the rest of the world. Low-income people absolutely rely on cash. Households with incomes under $25,000 use cash for 36 percent of their payments, while households with incomes over $150,000 use cash for only 10 percent of theirs. Lower-middle class or poor households are frequently un- or under-banked and have practically no savings rate as it is—forcing them into the formal economy would reduce their standard of living even further.\n\nThe number of cashless businesses is exploding. Part of this is consumer preferences—paying with a card or a phone is less awkward and clumsy than having a bunch of change slamming around your pocket. But what we gain in convenience, we lose in privacy and freedom. The chance that a digital dollar will be implemented in the next 20 years is exceptionally high, and most of the population will go along with it—willingly."

        "full_text": "“While our management team and the men and women of the Postal Service have established the path toward financial sustainability and high operating performance — and we have instituted enormous beneficial change to what had been an adrift and moribund organization — much work remains that is necessary to sustain our positive trajectory,” DeJoy wrote in a statement. “I also have no doubt that the entirety of the Postal Service will aggressively shape its future and become more efficient, capable, and competitive as it continuously changes and improves to best serve the American public.”\n\nThis follows DeJoy’s letter to the Board of Governors in February that signaled he planned to quit. In this letter, he said his role was made more difficult by “the almost unceasing resistance to change.” DeJoy took on the role in June 2020 amid the pandemic and presidential election that would largely take place via mail-in voting.\n\nBy 2024, out of the 3.37 billion pieces of political mail and election mail, the average delivery time was one day, according to USPS. That meant more than 97% of ballots got to local election officials in fewer than three days and that more than 99% got to them within seven days. However, 150,630 ballots sent between Oct. 31 and Election Day, according to USPS, were likely “physically impossible for that voter to receive the Ballot Mail, complete their ballot, and return their ballot by mail in time to meet the jurisdiction’s deadline.” Over 30,000 ballots were sent to voters on Election Day.\n\nDeputy Postmaster General Douglas Tulino will serve in the interim until the board decides on a permanent replacement. The USPS did not offer a timeline for its decision.\n\nFive years ago, before the board nominated DeJoy as its 75th postmaster, stamps cost 50 cents. By the end of DeJoy’s tenure, they cost 73 cents, a 36% increase. Stamp sales help fund the Postal Service, as it does not receive tax dollars toward its operating expenses. The hike will result in an anticipated $44 billion in revenue by 2031.\n\nUSPS SIGNS AGREEMENT WITH DOGE TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY, CUT 10,000 WORKERS\n\nLast November, the Postal Service reported an annual loss of $6.5 billion. That year, first-class mail was at its lowest volume since 1968."

        "full_text": "WASHINGTON, D.C. – President Trump is invoking a \"state secret privilege\" and refusing to provide any additional information to the D.C. District Court judge involved in the high-profile Venezuelan migrant deportation case.\n\nCiting the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th-century wartime law, the Trump administration recently deported hundreds of reported Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador. As planes were in the middle of the trip, a federal judge ruled against the move, yet the administration continued the deportations, setting up this latest showdown.\n\n\"What we did, what was done by the Trump administration, was exactly in accordance with federal law, enacted by Congress and signed by the president. We aren't making this up, we're enforcing laws that are on the books,\" Border Czar Tom Homan said on ABC's This Week.\n\nJudge James Boasberg ruled the Venezuelans deserved a court hearing before their deportations to determine whether they belonged to the violent Tren de Aragua gang. He has warned the Trump administration of consequences if evidence shows officials deliberately disobeyed his order.\n\nTrump and certain cabinet members have been ramping up attacks, calling for Judge Boasberg to be impeached or disbarred.\n\n\"This is an out-of-control judge, a federal judge, trying to control our entire foreign policy, and he cannot do it,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said recently on Fox News.\n\nThe Trump administration wants Boasberg's order reversed. A three-judge appeals court heard oral arguments in the case, Monday, appearing divided. One judge seemingly open to the administration's arguments, another remaining silent, while a third claimed that alleged Nazis in the U.S. during World War II were treated better than the Venezuelan migrants.\n\n\"People weren't given notice. They weren't told where they were going... Those people on those planes on that Saturday had no opportunity to file habeas or any type of action to challenge the removal,\" said Judge Patricia Millett during the hearing.\n\nThe appeals court intends to issue a ruling in the coming days, but Bondi says the Supreme Court will likely get the case.\n\n\"The Alien Enemies Act applies today, really more than ever. Old law is often the best law, the laws that have been on the books for a long time. We are in modern warfare. They have invaded our country, TDA, Tren de Aragua. They are organized, they have a command structure, they are sending money to each other, throughout the country, and out of the country, back to support their terrorist actions,\" Bondi said.\n\nThe Trump administration plans to continue arresting people as this plays out in court, and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem is scheduled to visit Central America this week, including the El Salvador prison housing those Venezuelan migrants.\n\n\"We're going to keep targeting the worst, of the worst, which we've been doing since day one, and deporting from the United States through the various laws on the books,\" said Homan."

        "full_text": "Frank Bisignano, President Trump’s pick to the lead the Social Security Administration, faced tough questioning from Senate Democrats on Tuesday, with lawmakers asking whether he would ignore calls from Elon Musk and others in the administration to make changes that could destabilize a critical program for retirees.\n\nIn a roughly three-hour confirmation hearing, Mr. Bisignano, most recently at the helm of payments giant Fiserv, was grilled about his commitment to improving Social Security’s customer service and asked to commit to not privatize the program or cut benefits, which would require acts of Congress.\n\n“I’ve never thought about privatizing,” Mr. Bisignano told Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, one of many Democrats who expressed concerns. “It’s not a word that anybody has ever talked to me about, and I don’t see this institution as anything other than a government agency that gets run for the benefit of the American public.”\n\nHe assured lawmakers that he would be in charge of the agency, and said he “will look at every item you want me to look at.”\n\n“To me, the job is to analyze everything we do. I know there are a lot of stats out there. I am not in the department, but I have looked at the data it produces and I think there is a land of opportunity,” he added, in another exchange.\n\nRepublicans on the Senate Finance Committee embraced Mr. Bisignano, calling out his experience operating payments processing companies, which they said would be ideal preparation for running the Social Security Administration. Mr. Bisignano portrayed himself as an “efficiency” expert and stressed that his experience eliminating fraud through technological solutions would be helpful in running the agency.\n\nMr. Bisignano’s confirmation hearing comes at a time of tumult for the agency, which plays a vital role in delivering retirement, survivor and disability payments to 73 million Americans each month.\n\nRecent policy changes to the program under Mr. Trump have caused widespread concern among beneficiaries and employees that access to benefits could become more difficult. The agency typically evolves slowly, aware that missteps could potentially cut off cash to many retirees and disabled people whose rely on benefits for a large portion of their income.\n\nBut changes have come far more rapidly in the month or so since a team from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency arrived at the Social Security Administration. The Trump administration has announced plans to cut 12 percent of the agency’s work force and more than 2,600 employees have committed to leaving so far.\n\nThe agency in recent weeks has also quickly, and sometimes clumsily, announced other policy changes that were met with criticism. One recent change would direct more beneficiaries from doing business over the phone to the agency’s website or field offices, at a time when staff is at a 50-year low and many workers are leaving.\n\nSenator Bernard Sanders, the Vermont independent, repeatedly asked Mr. Bisignano about whether it was wise to lay off large numbers of workers at a time the agency was understaffed, until he got a direct answer.\n\n“I think the answer is probably no,” Mr. Bisignano replied.\n\nMr. Bisignano, who described himself in an interview on CNBC as “fundamentally a DOGE person,” appeared to distance himself from the what’s been happening inside the Social Security Administration.\n\nBut that characterization was challenged at the hearing by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who produced a statement that he said was from a whistle-blower. Mr. Wyden, citing the letter, said that Mr. Bisignano had personally intervened to get key DOGE officials involved at the agency, including one who was approved in the middle of the night.\n\nMr. Bisignano said he has never spoken to Leland Dudek, the acting commissioner, but had talked to Mike Russo, the current chief information officer, whom he knows from the corporate world.\n\nMr. Bisignano has spent much of his career working for big financial institutions, including positions at Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase. In 2017 he earned $100 million working at First Data Corporation, which was more than 2,000 times the average employee’s salary at the firm at the time; First Data later merged with Fiserv.\n\nSenator Peter Welch, a Democrat from Vermont, said he’s concerned that Mr. Musk and his team have been “shooting first and aiming later,” and have far more control over federal agencies than the people running them. Mr. Bisignano tried to alleviate those concerns.“I think the president has made clear that DOGE is there for input,” Bisignano said.\n\nSeveral senators also pressed Mr. Bisignano about the false claims that President Trump and Mr. Musk continue to repeat, including those that millions of dead people are collecting benefits.\n\nMr. Bisignano declined to contradict Elon Musk’s repeated assertions that Social Security is a “Ponzi scheme.” When Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat from Nevada, asked him to respond “yes or no” to that statement, he said only: “It’s a promise to pay.”\n\nSome Democrats questioned whether Mr. Bisignano’s past solutions in the corporate world, such as reliance on artificial intelligence for customer service, would be appropriate for Social Security beneficiaries, and Sen. Wyden started the hearing blasting Mr. Bisignano for overseeing the loss of thousands of workers at his private companies.\n\nRepublicans on the Senate Finance Committee appeared united in their readiness to smooth his way to a vote of the full Senate. “You know how to deliver what we all want from Social Security, and we are all looking forward to moving forward expeditiously with your nomination,” Senator Mike Crapo of Idaho said at the conclusion of the hearing.\n\nEmployees inside Social Security have said they are hopeful the incoming commissioner will provide a sense of stability, but Democratic senators were less optimistic. “You recently said on CNBC that you are fundamentally a DOGE person,” said Senator Tina Smith, Democrat of Minnesota, “and I take you at your word.”\n\nTony Romm and Nicholas Nehamas contributed reporting."

        "full_text": "On February 1st, President Trump imposed 25% tariffs on nearly all goods imported from Canada. Since then, his administration has engaged in an on again off again trade war with our longtime ally. The tariffs were imposed based on the exaggerated claim that millions of criminals and tons of deadly fentanyl have been pouring over the border into the United States— and that Canada has allowed it to happen.\n\nLast month we went to the northern border, to the Chazy River, where even in the middle of winter, migrants continue to cross its frozen banks, often guided by human smugglers who openly advertise their services on Facebook and TikTok.\n\nIf President Trump and the Canadian government really want to tackle illegal immigration there, they might want to start online.\n\nSearch for 'border excursions' on TikTok and Facebook and you'll find a black market set to music that guarantees migrants safe passage across the northern border. There are posts in Spanish, English, and Punjabi. And reviews like you'd find on Yelp. These men in the back of a car, on their way to a new life in the United States, give their smugglers five stars and a thumbs up.\n\nStretching more than 5,500 miles, the U.S.-Canadian border is the longest international land border in the world. That's the U.S. on the right and Canada on the left.\n\nIn February, we traveled to an area the U.S. Customs and Border Protection calls the Swanton Sector, which runs from New Hampshire to upstate New York. Last year, more than 80% of migrant apprehensions at the northern border happened here.\n\nThe Swanton Sector is where this video was recorded in January. A group of men who just crossed the border ran to an SUV that drove them deeper into New York. You'll also see a woman getting out of the car and go north to Canada.\n\nThis man told us he coordinated the handoff and took the video:\n\nCecilia Vega: Can you tell us who you work for?\n\nJavi (in Spanish/English translation): For the Sinaloa Cartel.\n\nHe goes by the name \"Javi\" and agreed to speak with us only with his camera off. He said he can't risk his identity being exposed.\n\nCecilia Vega: How does this work? They tell you where to go? They tell you how many people you have to bring across each week?\n\nJavi (in Spanish/English translation): Exactly. That's how it goes. They provide the people. They have more people who are behind all this looking for customers, finding them, and summoning them to certain locations.\n\nWe found Javi through his online ads, which he says TikTok recently took down. In a conversation with our producer, he did briefly turn his camera on and allowed us to record his masked face.\n\nWhile it's not possible to verify everything Javi told us, he sent these pictures of what he says are his guns as proof of his ties to the Sinaloa Cartel. A source in Canadian intelligence told us Javi's story is consistent with the cartel's human and drug smuggling operations.\n\nThe Sinaloa Cartel is one of the largest and most notorious in Mexico. These are videos Javi sent us of his work. He says he's part of a team of four. Some drive migrants to and from the border and plan logistics, while Javi says he guides people through the woods. The migrants pay about $3,000 each. Javi told us he makes about a thousand dollars per person… $500 go to the cartel -- the rest to the drivers. Some smugglers offer discounts for children.\n\nCecilia Vega: What's the youngest child you've ever crossed?\n\nJavi (in Spanish/English translation): Three months.\n\nCecilia Vega: Tres meses.. (Translation: Three months)\n\nJavi (in Spanish/English translation): Yes. Babies.\n\nCecilia Vega: what happens if one of the migrants you're working with doesn't pay?\n\nJavi (in Spanish/English translation): They cannot go. They are held hostage until they pay up.\n\nCecilia Vega: Until what?\n\nJavi (in Spanish/English translation): Until they pay.\n\nCecilia Vega: Do you work only with humans, or do you move drugs also?\n\nJavi (in Spanish/English translation): Everything.\n\nCecilia Vega: How much fentanyl do you move across that border?\n\nJavi (in Spanish/English translation): Lately, it's been quiet. But for a while there, we were bringing in thirty kilos per month.\n\nCecilia Vega: Wow.\n\nCecilia Vega: The drugs come from?\n\nCecilia Vega: De China? (Translation: From China?)\n\nJavi (in Spanish/English translation): From China.\n\nCecilia Vega: De China (Translation: From China)\n\nJavi (in Spanish/English translation): I get more into the U.S., but also it goes from the U.S. to Canada. And weapons.\n\nOn the Canadian border with a Mexican cartel smuggler\n\nHow many pounds of drugs come across the northern border into the United States is unknown. President Trump claims tremendous amounts of fentanyl pour into the country through Canada.\n\nLast year U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the northern border compared to more than 21,000 pounds confiscated at the U.S.- Mexico border.\n\nAnd while the southern border saw 1.5 million illegal crossings last year, there were fewer than 24,000 illegal crossings from Canada.\n\nSheriff David Favro: See this woodline up here on the left? They come from way over there on the other side of-- you know, back side of Canada and walk along the edge of that woodline. And the woodline continues and goes down to the creek. Then they would follow the creek.\n\nSheriff David Favro oversees Clinton County, New York, which includes about 28 miles of border.\n\nCecilia Vega: Where are the smugglers in all this?\n\nSheriff David Favro: They're-- they're hiding. They're-- they're the cowards that are just taking the money, not caring about the people that are crossing, and what hazards those people might run into. So they're the ones that are just running the business and collecting the cash.\n\nLast year in the Swanton Sector, there were more illegal crossings than the previous 17 years combined-- more than 19,000 migrants were arrested there. They came from 97 countries- mostly from India and Mexico.\n\nAnd they cross year round, even through blizzards. In the middle of winter, authorities respond weekly to 911 calls from migrants. In January, six Haitians, including a 9-year-old girl, became lost in the woods and some were hospitalized with serious injuries. Last month, this man from Spain suffered severe frostbite.\n\nSheriff Favro took us down a local road divided by the border. The area is covered by surveillance cameras on both sides. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police saw us and soon after drove by on patrol.\n\nCecilia Vega: when someone is crossing in the dead of winter and there's feet of snow, what are they up against out there?\n\nSheriff David Favro: They're up against a lot. And the worst thing that they're up against is the freezing cold, because the temperatures-- you're-- you're walking through the snow and your pants are getting wet, your boots are gonna start soaking through eventually, and they don't even realize. They're so desperate and so quick to try and get to where-- where they're-- they wanna be, that they don't realize frostbite is setting in. And that's one of the biggest dangers.\n\nThe case Sheriff Favro says he'll never forget is the death of Ana Vazquez-Flores. Residents of Champlain, New York erected a memorial in honor of her and her unborn baby.\n\nThe 33-year-old supermarket worker was 5 months pregnant with her first child when she and her husband flew from Mexico to Montreal in December 2023.\n\nThey found this Colombian man who advertised on TikTok and hired him to guide Ana across the border.\n\nText messages taken from court documents show they paid him $2,500.\n\nAna's husband asked \"... is it safe?\"\n\n\"Well, look…truth is the only certain thing in life is death, but we are effective.\"\n\nOn the evening of December 11th, Ana began her walk alone through the snow. The alleged smuggler tracked her by GPS on their phones and texted directions. It was dark and the temperature was below freezing.\n\nAna's husband had a visa to work in the United States and was waiting for her in New York.\n\nHe wrote: \"have you already picked her up?\"\n\n\"She is crossing friend.\"\n\n\"I am very nervous.\" her husband said.\n\nForty minutes later, the alleged smuggler wrote, \"bro, hello, I think she got wet or turned off her cell phone.\"\n\nInvestigators think Ana was following his instructions when she stepped into the icy Chazy River. She was already in America. Three days later park rangers and sheriff Favro's deputies found Ana's body.\n\nThe alleged smuggler was arrested at his home in Quebec by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at the request of the U.S. Justice Department. He was extradited to the United States in February. He pleaded not guilty to smuggling charges and is being held at the Clinton County jail.\n\nSheriff Favro says that's the type of coordination that should happen between neighbors.\n\nSheriff David Favro: I find it unusual that up here along the northern border with all the attention that we've had, I haven't been contacted by anybody at a federal level, really, other than the Border Patrol. We work hand in hand with the Border Patrol.\n\nCecilia Vega: But you've not heard from Washington, from the White House, from anybody in the president's administration who have been looking intently at your border here?\n\nSheriff David Favro: No.\n\nThis six-time elected sheriff-- a Democrat-- does credit President Trump's immigration policies for the drop in illegal crossings that he's seen at the northern border.\n\nAnd while Sheriff Favro welcomes a lull, after 43 years in law enforcement, he says the quiet rarely lasts.\n\nSheriff David Favro: Today, our state of mind is, \"When is something gonna happen?\" That's-- that's the big concern. And that's always in the back of, I think, every law enforcement member's mind. When is --when is something going to occur? When the numbers are down it gets eerily quiet and we kind of worry about quiet. We like it when-- when things are just steady so that we-- we know what's going on, have a better handle on it.\n\nCecilia Vega: You don't trust the quiet–\n\nSheriff David Favro: We-- we–\n\nCecilia Vega: That it's gonna stick–\n\nSheriff David Favro: We just don't trust the quiet is gonna stick.\n\nCanada's new Prime Minister Mark Carney retaliated with tariffs in response to President Trump's tariffs. But the Canadian government did concede to Trump's complaints about the border and announced a nearly billion dollar plan to strengthen border security, by adding more boots on the ground, helicopters and drones and appointed a fentanyl czar.\n\nCecilia Vega: Are tariffs the answer?\n\nKelly Sundberg: The tariffs have disrupted relationships between our two countries both economically and socially. I mean, I don't see Canada as really being the issue here. Yeah, the border needs to be secured, but there's better ways of doing it than threatening your largest and longest standing partner.\n\nProfessor Kelly Sundberg spent 15 years as an officer in the Canadian Border Services Agency and now researches border security at Mount Royal University in Calgary.\n\nKelly Sundberg: We've done a lotta great steps in trying to keep the border open. On the Canadian side we have fallen short in keeping it secure. We do not have-- a Border Patrol, such as the United States. We have very few officers. So-- equivalent to ICE-- so your Immigration Customs Enforcement in the United States-- which has thousands of officers, for our entire country we have 400. Clearly, if we're going to-- address the concerns of President Trump-- let alone the concerns of many Canadians also, is we need to increase those numbers.\n\nCecilia Vega: You'd like to see more?\n\nKelly Sundberg: For the number of cases that we have, I've calculated we probably need around 4,000 to 5,000 officers nationally.\n\nLast month Canada and the United States -- on the same day-- declared the Sinaloa Cartel a terrorist organization.\n\nWe spoke to Javi again this week and he told us the cartel has since had to change the way it moves drugs across the northern border, but the designation has not affected how many people they smuggle into the United States illegally.\n\nCecilia Vega: What has the return of Donald Trump meant for your business?\n\nJavi (in Spanish/English translation): There's always going to be business. Later on, Donald Trump's time will pass, and this will continue. This is not going to stop.\n\nCecilia Vega: If they put more border patrol officers at the border, if they put more checkpoints, is there anything anyone can do to stop you from moving people across the border?\n\nJavi: No. No.\n\nCecilia Vega: Nada? (Translation: nothing?)\n\nJavi (in Spanish/English translation): No, nothing. There's always a way. The border between Canada and the U.S. is much bigger than the one with Mexico. You can always get in.\n\nCecilia Vega: You'll find another way.\n\nJavi (in Spanish/English translation): Always.\n\nProduced by Michael Rey and Jaime Woods. Associate producer, Luisa Garcia.

That proposal, Peskov said, came from President Donald Trump and was agreed to by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nA proposed pause in long-range attacks on energy and other critical infrastructure targets was also expected to be part of the discussions. Though Putin and Zelenskyy both agreed to the proposal in principle last week, cross-border strikes had continued.\n\nThe U.S.-Russia meeting on Monday came on the heels of a meeting between the American and Ukrainian teams in Riyadh on Sunday. U.S. and Ukrainian representatives also held talks after the American meeting with the Russian team concluded, a source familiar with the discussions told ABC News.\n\nThe Ukrainian and U.S. delegations met again in Riyadh on Tuesday, Ukrainian officials said.\n\nOn Monday, responding to another round of Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian cities, Zelenskyy wrote on social media that \"the war was brought from Russia and it is to Russia that the war must be pushed back. They must be the ones forced into peace. They are the ones who must be pressured to ensure security.\"\n\nOn Monday night into Tuesday morning, Ukraine's air force said Russia launched one missile and 139 drones into the country, of which 78 drones were shot down and 34 lost in flight without causing damage.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said its forces shot down five Ukrainian drones over occupied Crimea.\n\nABC News' Anna Sergeeva, Oleksiy Pshemyskiy, Will Gretsky, Ellie Kaufman and Guy Davies contributed to this report."

        "full_text": "The Social Security Administration website crashed four times in 10 days this month because the servers were overloaded, blocking millions of retirees and disabled Americans from logging in to their online accounts. In the field, office managers have resorted to answering phones in place of receptionists because so many employees have been pushed out. Amid all this, the agency no longer has a system to monitor customer experience because that office was eliminated as part of the cost-cutting efforts led by Elon Musk.\n\nAnd the phones keep ringing. And ringing.\n\nThe federal agency that delivers $1.5 trillion a year in earned benefits to 73 million retired workers, their survivors, and poor and disabled Americans is engulfed in crisis — further undermining the already struggling organization’s ability to provide reliable and quick service to vulnerable customers, according to internal documents and more than two dozen current and former agency employees and officials, customers and others who interact with Social Security.\n\nFinancial services executive Frank Bisignano is scheduled to face lawmakers Tuesday at a Senate confirmation hearing as President Donald Trump’s nominee to become the permanent commissioner. For now, the agency is run by a caretaker leader in his sixth week on the job who has raced to push out more than 12 percent of the staff of 57,000. He has conceded that the agency’s phone service “sucks” and acknowledged that Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service is really in charge, pushing a single-minded mission to find benefits fraud despite vast evidence that the problem is overstated.\n\nThe turmoil is leaving many retirees, disabled claimants, and legal immigrants needing Social Security cards with less access or shut out of the system altogether, according to those familiar with the problems.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“What’s going on is the destruction of the agency from the inside out, and it’s accelerating,” Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) said in an interview. “I have people approaching me all the time in their 70s and 80s, and they’re beside themselves. They don’t know what’s coming.”\n\nKing’s home state has the country’s oldest population. “What they’re doing now is unconscionable,” he said.\n\nSkip to end of carousel\n\nHelp us report on DOGE\n\nThe Washington Post wants to hear from people affected by DOGE activities at federal agencies. You can contact our reporters by email or Signal encrypted message:\n\nHannah Natanson: hannah.natanson@washpost.com or (202) 580-5477 on Signal.\n\nLisa Rein: lisa.rein@washpost.com or (202) 821-3120 on Signal.\n\nEnd of carousel\n\nLeland Dudek, who became acting commissioner after he fed data to Musk’s team behind his bosses’ backs, has issued a series of rapid-fire policy changes that have created chaos for front-line staff. Under pressure from the secretive Musk team, Dudek has pushed out dozens of officials with years of expertise in running Social Security’s complex benefit and information technology systems. Others have left in disgust.\n\nThe moves have upended an agency that, despite the popularity of its programs, has been underfunded for years, faces potential insolvency in a decade and has been led by four commissioners in five months — just one of them Senate-confirmed. The latest controversy came last week when Dudek threatened to shut down operations in response to a federal judge’s ruling against DOGE that he claimed would leave no one in the agency with access to beneficiaries’ personal information.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlarmed lawmakers are straining to answer questions back home from angry constituents. Calls have flooded into congressional offices. AARP announced Monday that more than 2,000 people a week have called the retiree organization since early February — double the usual number — with concerns about whether benefits they paid for during their working careers will continue. Social Security is the primary source of income for about 40 percent of older Americans.\n\nTrump has said repeatedly that the administration “won’t touch” Social Security, a promise that aides say applies to benefit levels that can be adjusted only by Congress. But in just six weeks, the cuts to staffing and offices have already taken a toll on access to benefits, officials and advocates say.\n\n‘Creating a fire’\n\nWith aging technology systems and a $15 billion budget that has stayed relatively flat over a decade, Social Security was already struggling to serve the public amid an explosion of retiring baby boomers. The staff that reviews claims for two disability programs was on life support following massive pandemic turnover — and still takes 233 days on average to review an initial claim.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut current and former officials, advocates and others who interact with the agency — many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution — said Social Security has been damaged even further by the rapid cuts and chaos of Trump’s first two months in office. Many current and former officials fear that the push is part of a long-sought effort by conservatives to privatize all or part of the agency.\n\n“They’re creating a fire to require them to come and put it out,” said one high-ranking official who took early retirement this month.\n\nDudek, who was elevated from a mid-level data analyst in the anti-fraud office, hurried to cut costs when he took over in mid-February, canceling research contracts, offering early-retirement incentives and buyouts across the agency, and consolidating programs and regional offices. Entire offices, including those handling civil rights and modernization, were driven out. The 10 regional offices that oversee field operations were slashed to four.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I do not want to destroy the agency,” he said in an interview Monday. “The president wants it to succeed by cutting out the red tape to improve service while improving security.”\n\nMusk’s Department of Government Efficiency team began poring through Social Security’s massive trove of private data on millions of Americans, working in a fourth-floor conference room at the Woodlawn, Maryland, headquarters, with blackout curtains on the windows and an armed security guard posted outside.\n\nAt first, the DOGE team was obsessed by false claims that millions of deceased people were receiving benefits. Then came new mandates designed to address alleged fraud: Direct-deposit transactions and identity authentication, operations that affect almost everyone receiving benefits, will no longer be able to be done by phone. Customers with computers will go through the process online; those without will wait in line at their local field office. A change announced internally last week will require legal immigrants with authorization to work in the United States and newly naturalized citizens to apply for or update their Social Security cards in person, eliminating a long-standing practice that sent the cards automatically through the mail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We realize this is a significant change and there will be a significant impact to customers,” Doris Diaz, deputy commissioner of operations, told the field staff Monday during a briefing on the changes, a recording of which was obtained by The Washington Post. She said the agency was “working on a process” for homeless and homebound customers who cannot use computers or come into an office — and acknowledged that service levels will decline.\n\nIn the weeks before that briefing, phone calls to Social Security surged — with questions from anxious customers wondering whether their benefits had been or would be cut and desperate to get an in-person field office appointment. That is, if they could get through to a live person.\n\nDepending on the time of day, a recorded message tells callers their wait on hold will last more than 120 minutes or 180 minutes. Some callers report being on hold for four or five hours. A callback function was available only three out of 12 times a Post reporter called the toll-free line last week, presumably because the queue that day was so long that the call would not be returned by close of business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe recording that 66-year-old Kathy Martinez heard when she called the toll-free number two weeks ago from the San Francisco Bay Area said her hold time would be more than three hours — she was calling to ask what her retirement benefits would come to if she filed for them now or waited until she turned 70. She hung up and tried again last week at 7 a.m. Pacific time. The wait was more than 120 minutes, but she was offered a callback option, and in two hours she spoke with a “phenomenally kind person who called me,” she said.\n\nMartinez said she wants to wait to file for benefits to maximize her check. But “I’m kind of thinking, I wonder if I should take it now. When I apply, I will do it over the phone. But will there still be a phone system?”\n\n‘Not acceptable’\n\nAging, inefficient phone systems have dogged Social Security for years. A modernization contract with Verizon begun under the first Trump administration suffered multiple delays, system crashes and other problems. As commissioner in the last year of the Biden administration, former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley moved the project to a new contractor, Amazon Web Services, and data shows that the average wait time for the toll-free line was down to 50 minutes, half of today’s average. But O’Malley ran out of time to switch the new system to field office phones, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow a perfect storm has overtaken the system. Turnover that’s normally higher than 10 percent has worsened at the 24 call centers across the country. Some employees took early retirement and buyout offers — a number that Dudek said was “not huge” but that current and former officials estimate could be significant.\n\nShonda Johnson, a vice president at the American Federation of Government Employees Council 220 who represents 5,000 call center staffers, said low pay (starting salary is $32,000 a year), anger at a return-to-office mandate after years of telework, rapid policy changes, and frustration with how the Trump administration is treating federal employees have hurt morale to the point that people aren’t giving their all to the job.\n\n“When you’re facing threats yourself, it kind of prevents you from being totally there for the public you’re servicing,” she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked about worsening phone service, Dudek told reporters in a call last week that “a 24 percent answer rate is not acceptable.”\n\n“I want people who want to get to a person to get to a person,” he said, adding that “all options are on the table” to improve phone service, including outsourcing some call center work.\n\nThe new limits on phone transactions take effect at the end of the month, but field offices have been deluged for weeks, even as DOGE is targeting an unspecified number of field and hearing offices for closure over the next three years.\n\nIn one office in central Indiana, the phone lines are jammed by 9 a.m. with hundreds of retirees, further taxing a staff of less than a dozen that is responsible for nearly 70,000 claimants across the state, according to one employee. That worker, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, said the questions have become predictable: What is the U.S. DOGE Service doing to Social Security? Will the office close? Will my benefits continue?\n\nThe employees, with no training yet on the impending changes, have few answers. “I hope we’re going to be here,” the employee tells caller after caller. “But I can’t guarantee anything.”\n\nComplicated benefits cases are falling by the wayside, the employee said. Online claims, which are completed by field staff, are piling up.\n\n“There is just no time to breathe or get anything else done,” she said. “We used to be efficient.”\n\nAnother employee in a regional office said the staff was told at a recent briefing that field offices across the country are seeing “exponential growth” in foot traffic. The elderly are not only calling but showing up at buildings to ask about the DOGE-led changes.\n\nIn one Philadelphia office, the federal government’s return-to-office edict has left 1,200 staffers competing for about 300 parking spots, according to an employee. Staffers wake up as early as 4:30 a.m. to try to snag a space, and some are buying backup spots for $200 a month nearby. As morale has cratered, some employees have stopped wearing business clothes and now come to work in jeans and a T-shirt because, as they tell colleagues, they no longer take pride in their work, the employee said.\n\n‘Off the charts’\n\nScammers are already taking advantage of the chaotic moment, according to internal emails obtained by The Post. Last week, employees in several offices were warned that seniors were reporting receiving emails from accounts pretending to be linked to Social Security. The messages asked recipients to verify their identity to keep receiving benefits.\n\n“Sounds like scammers are jumping on this press release to trick the elderly,” one Social Security staffer wrote to colleagues Thursday, referring to the agency’s announcement of the in-person verification program.\n\nIn Baltimore, an employee who works on critical payment systems said nearly a quarter of his team is already gone or will soon be out the door as a result of resignations and retirements. Talented software developers and analysts were quick to secure high-paying jobs in the private sector, he said — and the reduction in highly skilled staff is already having consequences.\n\nHis office is supposed to complete several software updates and modernization processes required by law within the next few weeks and months, he said. But with the departures, it seems increasingly likely that it will miss those deadlines.\n\nHis team is also called on to fix complicated technology glitches that stop payments. But many of the experts who make those fixes are exiting.\n\n“That has to get cleaned up on a case-by-case basis, and the experts in how to do that are leaving,” the Baltimore employee said. “We will have cases that get stuck, and they’re not going to be able to get fixed. People could be out of benefits for months.”\n\nMeanwhile, a DOGE-imposed spending freeze has left many field offices without paper, pens and phone headsets — at the exact moment phone calls are spiking, the employee in Indiana said.\n\nThe freeze drove all federal credit cards to a $1 limit, and purchasers for the agency were reduced to about a dozen people for 1,300 offices, said one employee in the Northeast.\n\nThese purchasers must get a green light from higher-ups for anything other than 12 specific preapproved transactions, according to emails obtained by The Post. The list includes “shipping costs,” “phone bills,” “Legionella testing” and “services to support fire safety and emergency response.” It does not include basic office supplies.\n\nThe field office in Portland, Oregon, is so slammed that the claims staff has told advocates to send questions or information by fax because they can’t get to the phones, according to Chase Stowell, case management supervisor for Assist, a nonprofit that helps disabled people apply for benefits. Many of them are homeless.\n\n“The attrition rates in Portland are off the charts,” Stowell said. “They just don’t pick up the phone. They were already short-staffed. They’ve told us they just don’t trust that there’s a reliable system to get ahold of them by voicemail.”\n\nThe service issues keep bubbling up to members of Congress. Hundreds of Maryland residents turned out for a town hall meeting last week hosted by Baltimore County Council member Pat Young about a mile from Social Security headquarters.\n\nAsked by one retiree in the audience to provide “a little bit of hope” that his Social Security benefits would not be cut, Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Maryland) conceded, “The truth of the matter is that we don’t know what they intend.”"

        "full_text": "WASHINGTON—The Trump administration on March 24 invoked the “state secrets privilege,” a move that could lead to the dismissal of the case against the government regarding the deportation of Venezuelan illegal immigrants to El Salvador.\n\nBy using this privilege, the Trump administration won’t have to provide information about deportees. Hence, the case against the government might be dismissed.\n\nWhile courts must review claims of privilege, they avoid excessive scrutiny to prevent revealing classified information. Recent cases such as United States v. Zubaydah (2021) and Federal Bureau of Investigation v. Fazaga (2021) have further defined the scope of this privilege.\n\nThe government has used the privilege in a variety of cases, including those involving surveillance, government contracts, and national security threats.\n\nThe move comes after U.S. District Judge James Boasberg began weighing whether the government violated his order to turn around planes deporting illegal immigrants alleged to be gang members.\n\nBoasberg asked for details about when the planes landed and who was on board. However, the Trump administration has said that giving that information would harm “diplomatic and national security concerns.”\n\nOn March 24, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit heard arguments on whether to stop Boasberg’s order blocking the Trump administration from deporting alleged members of a Venezuelan gang under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nU.S. Circuit Judge Patricia Millett seemed skeptical of the administration’s position. U.S. Circuit Judge Justin Walker, meanwhile, asked multiple questions of both sides and seemed sympathetic to the administration’s arguments.\n\nThe administration transferred hundreds of Venezuelan illegal immigrants to El Salvador—invoking the Alien Enemies Act for the first time since World War II—shortly before Boasberg issued the written order that blocked such deportations.\n\nSam Dorman and The Associated Press contributed to this report."

        "full_text": "In his chaotic attempt to dismantle democratic governance, redefine citizenship and cast aside fundamental rights of speech and due process, President Trump has all but declared war on one of the most effective forces to stand in his way: America’s legal institutions.\n\nHe has moved to purge the Department of Justice of all but those he perceives as loyal to him personally, demanded changes to law school curriculums, called with increasing furor for the impeachment of judges with whom he disagrees, attacked by name public-interest attorneys and bar associations that oppose his policies, and inched perilously close to defying court orders outright. In recent weeks Mr. Trump has also gone after the nation’s leading law firms — Covington & Burling; Perkins Coie; Paul, Weiss; and many more — with measures meant to hobble their ability to do business.\n\nOf all of the American legal institutions now facing sustained attack, none would seem better positioned to push back against Mr. Trump’s strongman tactics than this class of wealthy and politically connected firms, known collectively as Big Law. Counsel to the world’s most powerful corporations, they are engaged in every sector of the marketplace and central to ensuring that the United States and global economy continue to spin. Yet where many ordinary judges, law school deans and public interest attorneys of both political parties have found the courage to push back against Mr. Trump’s anti-constitutional histrionics, Big Law has largely stayed silent or worse.\n\nThese firms face a classic problem of collective action: Every individual firm has an incentive to keep quiet, but if everyone stays silent, all will lose. The problem is understandable. It is also solvable. It requires firms to find the courage to act together.\n\nCovington & Burling, the white-shoe Washington-based firm, was first to be targeted by the president. Its offense: having provided pro bono legal work for Jack Smith, who led the federal prosecution against Mr. Trump for his attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election. On Feb. 25, Mr. Trump issued an executive order that suspended the security clearances of Covington lawyers who had anything to do with Mr. Smith’s representation and directed federal agencies to end any business with the firm. The firm has had virtually nothing to say in response.\n\nPerkins Coie likewise attracted Mr. Trump’s ire for having represented Hillary Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign. He ordered a review for any government contracts with the firm, while also effectively barring its lawyers from federal buildings and stripping them of security clearances — potentially disabling sanctions for a firm whose clients have included major defense contractors like Boeing, Microsoft and Northrop Grumman. To its credit, Perkins Coie decided to mount a defense, and turned to Quinn Emanuel, an equally prestigious Los Angeles-based firm, to lead it. According to a Times report, Quinn Emanuel balked. (The firm Williams & Connolly has taken the case.) Since then, other firms have reportedly declined to sign an amicus brief on Perkins Coie’s behalf.\n\nMost stunning of all, Paul, Weiss, one of the most venerable firms in the world, elected last week to strike a deal with Mr. Trump, agreeing, among other things, to contribute tens of millions of dollars worth of pro bono services to some of the president’s favored causes. The firm’s chair later explained it did so because clients were getting spooked and other firms — rather than rallying to Paul, Weiss’s defense — began “aggressively soliciting our clients and recruiting our attorneys.”\n\nThe choice by these firms to accommodate Mr. Trump’s attacks, either through action or silence, is deeply wrong. It weakens the rule-of-law system on which all Americans depend — a system in which the rules are publicly known and set in advance, not subject to the whims of arbitrary vendettas. It equally hastens America’s slide from a system of constitutional democracy, in which executive power is constrained by multiple independent institutions, to a regime of fiat akin to those authoritarian governments our country has long stood against.\n\nThe choice is misguided as a business strategy, too, compromising attorney ethics, which can expose them to discipline by bar associations and courts, and giving clients ample reason to doubt that the firms will act unflinchingly in their defense. Above all, it is futile, as it will do nothing to protect the firms from the extortion-based governance we now appear to face for at least the next four years.\n\nMr. Trump’s tactics against Big Law and other legal institutions seem clearly aimed at demonstrating there is no law but whatever deal the president is personally willing to strike, indeed no law but Trump. Such a vision cannot be reconciled with the idea of individual rights nor with the idea that ordered rules, not raw power, constrain the behavior of the people and their governors alike.\n\nMore to the present point, it cannot be reconciled with the obligation of contract, the foundation of the global economy. America’s commitment to the rule of law has been the rock on which all of the nation’s business interests depend. Its stability is a central reason investors from around the world long flocked to our shores. If that stability gives way to a system in which it is no longer possible to rely on or even to know the rules of the game, no one stands to lose more than the corporate clients these law firms represent.\n\nIt’s not hard to see why these firms may have decided to cede to Mr. Trump’s power grab. Partners have fiduciary obligations to their peers and employees. If the firm can just avoid open antagonism of the governing regime, the thinking may go, then it will survive until the turbulence subsides. Paul, Weiss’s chairman, Brad Karp, has repeatedly tried to assure his firm that the arrangement he struck was consistent with the principles that have guided the firm for its 150-year history.\n\nYet the deal Mr. Karp described to his colleagues differed markedly from the one the president announced. Mr. Trump’s version has the firm acknowledging both the “wrongdoing” of Mark Pomerantz, a former partner who explored a criminal case against Mr. Trump while working for the Manhattan district attorney, and the “grave dangers of Weaponization, and the vital need to restore our System of Justice” that Mr. Trump has long complained were used against him. Whatever Mr. Karp believes he agreed to, the president plainly does not share his view.\n\nIt is wrong to imagine such a deal could safeguard the interests of the commercial clients on which these law firms depend. And it is foolhardy to imagine these clients can go four years without taking any position that rankles this administration.\n\nTake Citigroup, which has been a client of Paul, Weiss. Its subsidiary, Citibank, already finds itself in litigation over the administration’s (almost certainly unlawful) effort to impound spending on Congress’s greenhouse gas reduction initiatives. In service of that impoundment, the Trump administration demanded Citibank freeze billions in funding for nonprofits. If a court orders Citibank to unfreeze the funds, which side will it take, the administration’s or the court’s? Or consider Verizon, a client of Quinn Emanuel. Verizon seems on the verge of being nudged out of its $2.4 billion contract with the Federal Aviation Administration because Elon Musk has reportedly decided that his business, Starlink, is more deserving of the work. Does sound counsel require advising Verizon to just let that one go?\n\nCorporations from Coca-Cola to Ford have been affected by Mr. Trump’s tariffs. They may well hope to negotiate their way out of the worst of the economic damage. But if those negotiations fail, or if the president’s promises prove as erratic as his tariffs, will the storied firms that represent these companies fight hard for their interests? Or will the firms push them to accept a lesser compromise, in the hopes of protecting themselves against presidential wrath?\n\nBig Law’s parallel hope — that the courts will save them from having to take the worst of the administration’s direct heat — has already been proven unavailing. When Mr. Trump issued his extraordinary order blackballing Perkins Coie, a Federal District Court in Washington moved with remarkable efficiency to block key parts of the order from taking effect. But even assuming that the court’s temporary judgment survives the coming appeals — and that the administration complies with it — the damage is already done.\n\nMany of Perkins Coie’s clients jumped ship on the basis of the initial order alone. And the court’s opinion clearly did nothing to slow Mr. Trump down. Just two days after being told that parts of the first order were unlawful, he issued his nearly identical order against Paul, Weiss. Three days after that, Mr. Trump’s Equal Employment Opportunity Commission announced it was now looking into “D.E.I. practices” at 20 more firms, a list no longer limited to those firms with Democratic connections.\n\nOver the weekend, Mr. Trump issued the broadest attack yet, ordering the attorney general to seek punishment for any lawyer or firm that takes a position in litigation the administration deems “unscrupulous.” In the climate of fear reinforced by Paul, Weiss’s actions — and other firms’ silence — threats alone are enough to drive away any firm’s business.\n\nAnother excuse circulating among Big Law lawyers is that speaking out won’t make a difference either way. Perkins Coie, after all, won its case without the broad support of its peer institutions.\n\nThat argument misses the point. Coming to Perkins Coie’s defense isn’t a decision about litigation strategy. It is about standing up to the administration’s intimidation. Signing on to joint briefs is not the only way to do that. Fellow firms and their clients could contribute to a joint defense fund, to help defray the costs of litigation and lost business for those on the receiving end of Mr. Trump’s score-settling wrath.\n\nThe point is for Big Law to do something — anything — as a group to demonstrate that they will continue to place their obligations to their clients and to the law above their fear of the bully. Solidarity can prove that point. And it can shore up the hope we all retain that the world’s strongest economy and oldest democracy will not both, simultaneously, fall.\n\nThe excuses made for Big Law’s silence are of course not limited to Big Law. The same collective action problem no doubt informs the discussions taking place inside the corner offices of the firms’ corporate clients, in the boardrooms of major media enterprises, at the gatherings of university trustees. The solutions to such problems are limited. But one tried and true approach remains clear: joining forces to fight back."

        "full_text": "Angela Lang is about to send her canvassing teams door knocking. But first, a moment to outline the stakes:\n\n“Fair maps, abortion, voting rights,” is Lang’s list. “It’s not a seat we can afford to lose because if Republicans and conservatives gain control of the court, that’s Elon Musk and that’s a through line to the Trump agenda.”\n\nOn paper, the April 1 election pits Susan Crawford against Brad Schimel for a vacancy on the Wisconsin state Supreme Court. Liberal Justice Ann Walsh Bradley is retiring, and the election will determine the court’s ideological balance. Crawford currently serves as a Dane County Circuit Court judge and is a former prosecutor and legal counsel to a past Democratic governor. Schimel is a Waukesha County Circuit Court judge and was the state’s GOP attorney general from 2015 to 2019.\n\nThe court race is a reminder that Wisconsin isn’t just a 50-50 state in presidential races. Close contests for Supreme Court seats have been common in recent years, and liberals are fighting in this one to maintain the 4-3 edge in the court they won in 2023.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s weekend endorsement of Schimel only elevates the national stakes of the contest.\n\nThey’re even bigger for Lang and organizations like Black Leaders Organizing for Communities, of which Lang is executive director. She preached a version of that “can’t afford to lose” argument five months ago, but Trump won Wisconsin on his way to a swing-state sweep and the White House. Now, with November’s bruises still tender, she faces another giant organizing and turnout challenge.\n\n“There’s always the finger-pointing after an election,” Lang said in an interview. “This would be the first true local test to see if there are lessons learned.”\n\nTrump increased his vote total and vote share in Milwaukee in November, including in the predominantly Black neighborhoods where BLOC operates. Lang’s way of doing things is among the points of post-election debate.\n\nPro-Trump groups were nowhere near as visible or active as BLOC when it came to door knocking and community meetings. Yet Trump increased his share of the Black vote and, with help from Musk and others, used digital tools to reach and activate voters.\n\nIn this Supreme Court election, Musk has funneled nearly $7 million to a conservative group in the state that is trying to mirror the 2024 strategy to mobilize voters for Trump. It includes digital targeting as well as traditional canvassing operations. A super PAC Musk has supported in the past is also spending heavily on television advertising. It is not required to disclose its donors.\n\nLang hears the criticism that old-fashioned door-knocking isn’t as effective or necessary anymore. But she dismisses it as uninformed.\n\n“We will definitely increase some of our digital stuff,” Lang said. But, “I will always take stock in listening to our team that is knocking all day every day and has more of a pulse on the community than any overpaid consultant that likely is not even from our state and hasn’t set foot in our community.”\n\nWe visited with Lang several times last year as part of our All Over the Map project tracking the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of Americans who live in key states and are part of crucial voting blocs. Lang was well aware, especially in the final weeks, that Trump was running stronger in her community, especially among Black men.\n\n“People didn’t feel the Democrats were addressing the needs and the issues of the average voter,” Lang said. “People wanted to try something different.”\n\nNow, despite the enormous stakes in the Supreme Court race, Lang and other progressives here told us turnout remains a giant worry.\n\n“There’s so much voter fatigue,” Lang said. “People don’t want to talk about politics right now. They feel completely checked out.”\n\nThat voter fatigue is just one piece of a complicated challenge for Democrats. There are tensions between grassroots activists and consultants over what went wrong in 2024 and how to fix it, both on how to prioritize an issues list and how to then communicate it more effectively; over whether they can or should make Musk an election foil.\n\nThere is also anger at Democratic leaders for not showing more fight – and having more success – as President Trump moves at a frenetic pace.\n\n“We need to hold our ground,” is how Democratic consultant Josh Klemons put it. “Then Senate Democrats cave and absolutely people are frustrated. There’s no question about it. … It’s very hard to keep asking people to give their everything when they don’t see real progress.”\n\nKlemons is trying, with frequent TikTok posts about the stakes of the court election. He is the first to admit that – at first glance, anyway – he might not look the part.\n\n“I’m not a camera guy,” Klemons said in an interview at his Madison home. “I didn’t grow up wanting to be a digital influencer.”\n\nBut he posted a TikTok complaining about how Republicans drew Wisconsin legislative maps a couple of years ago. “And it blew up,” he said. “And I did another a few days later, and it blew up even harder.”\n\nNow, he posts one a day on average, some shot in his basement office, others on a woodsy trail near his home. “My whole message is that we are in this together,” he said. “No campaign is going to save us.”\n\nOn our latest Wisconsin visit, we stopped by a Milwaukee Democrats monthly meeting where the discussion was mostly about the urgency of the court race. But one member offered a resolution urging the group to invest in new organizing offices in Black and Latino sections of the city where Trump improved his vote share in 2024.\n\nKlemons has no issue with more visibility and brick-and-mortar party offices. But he says Democrats and progressives need to think and act on a much grander scale.\n\n“Republicans have built a massive media infrastructure that allows them to get out their message in a way Democrats cannot compete with,” he said. “It doesn’t matter if our messages are better or not because they are not getting heard.”\n\nKlemons sees a 2024 replay in the final weeks of the Crawford-Schimel race: Musk pouring millions into advertising and turnout efforts.\n\n“Wisconsin has a real chance on April 1 to show money cannot buy elections,” he said in the interview – echoing one of his TikTok themes. “The world’s richest man cannot pick and choose who should serve in our government at every level.”\n\nDemocrats are making Musk as much of an issue, if not even more of one, than Trump himself.\n\n“We live in Elon Musk’s world right now,” Klemons said. “I’m working very hard to make sure we don’t live in Elon Musk’s Wisconsin.”\n\nKate Duffy, like Klemons, calls her path to Instagram accidental. She founded a group called Motherhood for Good back in 2022 and now posts regularly on issues she sees as essential to busy mothers like herself.\n\n“I try to make content that can be digested between bath and bedtime,” Duffy said in an interview at her home in suburban Milwaukee. “A quick video that somebody can watch in two or three minutes is going to do really well.”\n\nOne Duffy staple is 60-second explainers of key issues and themes. She augments the posts with maps and graphics. But she is also now leaning into longer posts – for her, a key lesson of her 2024 experience trying to help Kamala Harris.\n\n“My biggest takeaway is to listen to my gut more,” Duffy said. “We can do a longer video. We can explain things more. We can add more nuance. People are craving that.”\n\nMessages from campaign consultants dissuaded her from doing more of that last year.\n\n“(I) kept hearing, well, ‘These are the messages. It needs to be quick and simple. And hit this.’ And looking back, I’m realizing that is probably what came off as inauthentic and didn’t really resonate with as many people.”\n\nAnother takeaway: Talk more and smarter about the economy and the cost of living.\n\n“There’s so many women who make all the household purchasing decisions and are in charge of the budget and that is certainly somewhere where we can do better,” Duffy said.\n\nDemocratic consultants, she said, urged a focus on abortion rights and women’s rights. “That’s foundational,” Duffy said. “I’m always going to believe in that. But we can’t discount somebody’s actual struggle they are feeling to put food on the table for their kids. That is a daily trauma they are dealing with. So I think we need to do a better job messaging towards the economy.”\n\nThe barbershop was a daily town hall long before the internet, long before new media and social media and big data.\n\nEric Jones stops by the Exodus Hair Studio in Milwaukee once a week for a trim and for crackling conversations about the Bucks and the Brewers, about the local economy and about everything under the sun when it comes to politics.\n\nJones was part of our All Over the Map Project last year and repeatedly told us – in part because of the chatter at Exodus – that Trump was running stronger among Black men than he had in 2016 and 2020.\n\nHe is, again, worried about Musk money late in a campaign.\n\n“Any political campaign is essentially an information war,” Jones said. “And any war needs a budget. The guy with the biggest budget tends to win.”\n\nAnd he is worried, again, about Black turnout.\n\n“I’ve asked a good amount of people,” Jones told us in an interview at Exodus. “It’s bad when you don’t know the candidates.”\n\nJones was a reliable barometer of his community throughout 2024. Now, in the early days of the new Trump term, he has two takeaways.\n\nJones hears some buyer’s remorse among Latino friends who shifted to Trump and now regret it because of the administration’s crackdown on the undocumented.\n\n“They are regretting it now – right now,” Jones said. “But his policies haven’t gotten to the Black community yet.” Many of Jones’ friends, for example, believe the federal government can be cut substantially and yawn when Trump critics complain about installing loyalists at the FBI and Department of Justice.\n\n“That doesn’t resonate with them,” Jones said. “Let him do something that affects their day-to-day.”\n\nSo far, Jones said he sees little to nothing that convinces him Democrats have learned their 2024 lessons. That worries him some in the context of the Supreme Court election.\n\n“But it’s kind of unfair,” Jones is quick to add. “Because it just happened to them. I don’t know if anybody can learn a lesson that quickly. … The midterms will be a better chance to see it.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information."

        "full_text": "The amount of damage the second Trump administration has already done on many fronts, from foreign policy to public health to America’s economic prospects, both for the months ahead and in the long run, is astonishing. And they’re just getting started.\n\nBut whenever I talk with other people about one of these disasters, I find them arguing about how to think about what’s happening. Are we looking at mind-boggling incompetence on the part of what Dan Drezner, using the technical language of international relations theory, calls “the dumbest motherfuckers alive”? Or are we looking at a sinister plot to destroy America as we know it?\n\nThe answer is “yes.” These people are both incompetent and evil.\n\nThe big disaster of the week (so far) has been Trump officials accidently sharing secret war planning with the editor of The Atlantic. Somehow including Jeffrey Goldberg in the Signal chat was clearly a fuckup, and an incredible one.\n\nBut why were they sharing highly sensitive information over a private messaging app rather than using secure channels? The most likely explanation is that they wanted to evade accountability: texts between government officials are supposed to remain part of the record, while Signal texts can be and in this case were set to disappear. As Phillips O’Brien notes, war planning aside, what the group chat reveals is top officials’ contempt for and hostility toward Europe; some of them opposed an operation against the Houthis because clearing the shipping lanes might help our (erstwhile?) allies.\n\nSo the disaster reflected both stupidity and bad intentions. And the same is true of other ongoing disasters, including the shockingly rapid collapse of the Social Security Administration.\n\nAs I hope you’re aware, Elon Musk’s DOGE, which is supposedly rooting out fraud and waste, has made Social Security a special target. Musk has done this even though it’s one of the federal government’s cleanest, most efficient programs, and has done an immense amount to reduce poverty among the elderly:\n\nSource: The Conversation\n\nWhy is he doing this?\n\nOne answer is incompetence. Musk sent his child programmers into the agency and they, not understanding how its databases worked, wrongly reported to him that millions of dead people were receiving benefits. He immediately went big with that claim, and his immense but fragile ego won’t let him admit that he messed up so badly on something so big. So he just keeps making wilder and wilder assertions about Social Security fraud, and in the name of preventing fraud and reducing waste has been rapidly degrading the agency’s ability to serve America’s seniors.\n\nAn alternative answer sees the damage to Social Security as part of a deliberate scheme to undermine public faith in government, and to create an opening for lucrative privatization schemes. (It remains notable that DOGE hasn’t so much as hinted about doing something about overpayments to Medicare Advantage plans run by private insurers, which we know are costing taxpayers tens of billions a year.)\n\nOn this view, Musk and company see crippling the Social Security Administration as a feature, not a bug, part of their overarching plan to undermine the safety net and make America safe for profiteering.\n\nWhich of these views is right? My answer is both. Musk is incompetent and evil. He suffers from billionaire brain — that special blend of ignorance and arrogance that occurs all too frequently in men who believe that their success in accumulating personal wealth means that they understand everything, no need to do any homework. But he also clearly detests anything that makes life better for non-billionaires.\n\nAnd he shares these traits with Donald Trump, which makes them allies, although I keep wondering when their egos will collide explosively.\n\nAnyway, at this point we should assume that the same combination of incompetence and bad intentions that afflicts national security and budget policy applies to everything the Trump administration touches. Incredibly, quite a few investors and journalists still believe that there’s deep thinking underlying the administration’s trade and currency policy. I guarantee you, there isn’t.\n\nI’ll delve into the “Mar-a-Lago accord” and all that over the weekend, but let’s just say that it’s quite clear, if you know anything about international economics, that these guys have no idea what they’re doing. And all of us will pay the price.\n\nMUSICAL CODA\n\nOr in the case of Pete Hegseth — who is somehow claiming that it’s The Atlantic’s fault — blame Jeff"

It is the subtitle of a book I wrote 20 years ago. Pete Hegseth, for one, could ask his former Fox News Channel colleague, Sean Hannity, who often introduced me when I was a guest on his show as the “Tell it early, all, yourself” crisis management expert.\n\nI have followed this strategy for the past 30 years to help clients – people, famous and not, companies, private and public, through major media and business crises. I know my approach is counterintuitive. It sometimes requires volunteering bad facts to the media, to get them all out publicly all at once, rather than waiting for them to dribble out, drip by drip, as they almost always do. You will achieve the ultimate goal of crisis management – get the story over with as quickly as possible and communicate to the public that you accept responsibility for your mistake.\n\nI have used this strategy successfully for many high-profile clients, whose stories I recounted in my book “Crisis Tales: Five Rules for Coping with Crises in Business, Politics, and Life”: from Martha Stewart to the Penn State University Board of Trustees, from Republican Sen. Trent Lott to the Democratic Rep. Charlie Rangel. In my experience, getting the truth out created a positive impression about the client, putting the crisis in the past and improving the prospects for reputation repair and rehabilitation.\n\nSecretary Hegseth, Mike Waltz, Tulsi Gabbard, et al., had you asked my advice when you first got the sinking feeling that journalist Jeffrey Goldberg was invited into the group chat without anyone noticing, I would have offered you five recommendations:\n\nFirst, I would have told you to immediately inform President Trump what happened, and tell him, as you already have, that the national security team had made a big mistake, even to the point of offering your resignation to show that you believe in accountability.\n\nAs it turns out, Trump, to his credit, has been gracious to you, attributing your mistake as understandable human error, and he almost certainly would not have accepted your resignation. But making the gesture would have enhanced your credibility before your inevitable appearances before Congress and in the media.\n\nSecond, you should have immediately issued a public statement admitting your mistake of judgment and taking responsibility. I would have urged you not to attack Jeff Goldberg, as several administration officials have done. Most discerning people view that as weak and disingenuous.\n\nThird, I recommend that you stop playing semantic games while trying to spin the idea that information about bombing another country wasn’t classified or highly sensitive. How does splitting hairs about “war plans” vs. “attack plans” absolve you? Answer: It doesn’t. It is also inconsistent with your core crisis management strategy and sincere message: your acceptance of responsibility and accountability.\n\nFourth, I would have urged Pete Hegseth or Mike Waltz specifically (talk about counterintuitive!) to call Goldberg and offer him an exclusive interview to explain what happened and own up to the mistakes committed by national security team.\n\nThe reason for doing so would not have been to hope for kid-glove treatment by The Atlantic or the rest of the media – and that would not have been the result. Granting Goldberg an exclusive interview would have allowed your message to dominate much of the follow-up media coverage.\n\nFifth, and finally – the most difficult advice of all (and the one I think you all would most quickly reject): You could use this episode to acknowledge the unfair treatment of Hillary Clinton by some of you and those on your side regarding her use of a BlackBerry device to send personal emails and official business emails, all of them stored on a secure server supervised by the U.S. Secret Service. You can now empathize with how she felt when she heard so many calling for her to be “locked up” without so much as a prosecution or trial.\n\nBelief in redemption and forgiveness is one great big common ground among most Americans – left, right, liberal, conservative, pro-Trump or pro-Biden. It’s one of our nation’s most appealing traits.\n\nIt’s not too late. It’s never too late to tell all the truth, tell it early, and tell it yourself. That is not only effective crisis management advice – it is good advice for you to turn the corner on this crisis and move on.\n\nLanny J.

        "full_text": "London — Following President Trump's announcement of 25% tariffs on cars and car parts imported into the United States, America's trading partners around the world have roundly condemned the policy. Mr. Trump said the tariffs will take effect on April 2, fueling a boom — he promised — in American economic growth.\n\nHe said there would be a transition period before Americans reap the benefits of his tariffs-led foreign and economic policy, but for the myriad nations that sell automobiles and components to the U.S., the impacts could be rapid, and devastating.\n\nBelow is a look at how some of America's biggest auto industry trading partners have reacted to the latest tariffs announced by the White House.\n\nCanada\n\nThe new tariffs would continue to upend decades of free trade between America's nearest neighbors, including one of its largest trading partners overall, Canada.\n\n\"President Trump announced 25% tariffs against our auto industry, and this is a direct attack,\" Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said at a news conference Wednesday.\n\n\"This will hurt us,\" he said, adding that \"Canadians as a whole across this country have gotten over the shock of the betrayal and are learning the lessons. We have to look out for ourselves and we have to look out for each other and work together for each other.\"\n\nThe prime minister said Canada would respond to the measures with retaliatory tariffs, and that he expected to speak with Mr. Trump about the trade standoff.\n\nMexico\n\nMexico said Thursday that it was already working with the Trump administration to carve out an exemption for its auto industry in the wake of the president's announcement.\n\nThe 25% tariffs Mr. Trump announced Wednesday do include some exemptions for vehicles and parts that fall under the existing USMCA free trade agreement between the U.S. and Mexico and Canada, but Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said under that preexisting trade deal, \"there shouldn't be any tariffs, that is the essence of the commercial treaty.\"\n\nAs she spoke, Mexico's economy minister Marcelo Ebrard was in Washington, meeting with Trump administration officials.\n\n\"If we are going to a system of such high tariffs, what we have to seek is a preferential treatment for Mexico in a way that we have conditions that protect our jobs and economic activity,\" Ebrard said in a video statement.\n\nMexico exported around 2.5 million vehicles to the U.S. in 2024, the Reuters news agency said, citing S&P Global Mobility.\n\nChina\n\nBeijing criticized the escalation in the trade war Thursday, with Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Guo Jiakun telling reporters, \"there are no winners in trade wars and tariff wars, and no country's development and prosperity are achieved by imposing tariffs.\"\n\nMr. Trump had hinted that China could be granted a reduction in the tariffs he's imposed in exchange for a deal that would see the social media platform TikTok's Chinese parent ByteDance sell the widely popular app to an American company.\n\n\"There are numerous ways you can buy TikTok, and we will find the one that's best for the country,\" Mr. Trump said Wednesday. \"Maybe I'll give them [China] a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done, you know, because every point in tariff is worth more money than TikTok.\"\n\nUnder a national security law passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Biden last year, ByteDance faces an April 5 deadline to find a non-Chinese buyer for TikTok, or the app will face a ban in the U.S.\n\nResponding to Mr. Trump's remarks, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson dismissed the suggestion on Thursday, saying: \"China has made clear its position on the issue of TikTok many times, and its opposition to additional tariffs is also consistent and clear.\"\n\nJapan\n\nJapan's top government spokesperson, Yoshimasha Hayashi, called the newly announced tariffs \"extremely regrettable\" on Thursday, and he urged the U.S. to exempt the country from the measures.\n\nAutomobiles made up over 28% of Japan's total exports to the U.S. in 2024 - the biggest Japanese export to America, according to Japanese Ministry of Finance data cited by Reuters.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, meanwhile, questioned the logic of Mr. Trump's policy, citing the investment his country has made in the United States.\n\n\"Japan is a country that is making the largest amount of investment to the United States, so we wonder if it makes sense for [Washington] to apply uniform tariffs to all countries. That is a point we've been making, and will continue to do so,\" he said Thursday.\n\nSouth Korea\n\nSouth Korea's Interior Minister said Thursday that the country's automotive industry would take a significant hit as a result of the new tariffs announced my Mr. Trump.\n\n\"About 50% of our automobile exports go to the United States, so there are concerns about significant damage to the auto industry,\" Ahn Duk-Geun said at a news conference. \"The difficulties will be especially severe for not only the finished car manufacturers, but also the parts suppliers.\"\n\nEurope\n\nKey U.S. allies in Europe, and the continent's auto industry, expressed concern over the new tariffs Thursday and urged Mr. Trump to reconsider.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen called the tariffs, \"bad for businesses, worse for consumers, in the US and the EU.\"\n\n\"The EU will continue to seek negotiated solutions, while safeguarding its economic interests,\" she said in a post on social media.\n\nGermany's Economy Minister Robert Habeck called for European strength and solidarity in response to the measures.\n\n\"The high US tariffs come as no surprise. We are prepared. What matters now is that the EU responds decisively to the tariff. It must be clear that we will not back down in the face of the US,\" he said.\n\nThe European Automobile Manufacturers Association — the main lobby group for the automobile industry in the EU — said it was deeply concerned by Mr. Trump's announcement.\n\n\"European automakers have been investing in the US for decades, creating jobs, fostering economic growth in local communities, and generating massive tax revenue for the US government,\" ACEA Director General Sigrid de Vries said in a statement. \"We urge President Trump to consider the negative impact of tariffs not only on global automakers but on US domestic manufacturing as well.\"\n\nIn London, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called Mr. Trump's auto tariffs \"very concerning,\" but said the U.K. would not rush \"into a trade war\" with the United States and would continue with \"intense discussions\" to strike a broad trade agreement with Washington.\n\nChancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves, the cabinet minister in charge of the economy, said in an interview Thursday that the British government would lobby the White House to carve out an exemption for U.K. automakers.\n\n\"Our two economies are so closely intertwined,\" she said. \"I believe, and we make this case to the United States, that free trade, fair trade, is good for both of our countries. But let's see where we get to in the next few days.\""

        "full_text": "23 hours ago\n\nKayla Epstein\n\nBBC News, New York\n\nFor the past 48 hours, top White House officials have faced questions from lawmakers and the press about how a journalist came to join a sensitive group chat for an upcoming military operation - and why President Donald Trump's national security team was sharing sensitive information in an unsecure manner.\n\nThe Atlantic first reported details of the group chat on the platform Signal after its editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, was added to it. He followed the thread as top Trump administration officials discussed upcoming military strikes against the Houthis in Yemen.\n\nThe Atlantic then on Wednesday published the entire text thread that showed the detailed and potentially classified rundown for a March air raids.\n\nWhile the thread appears to have contained sensitive information, there is still much that remains unknown. Here are four lingering questions regarding so-called \"Signal-gate\".\n\nWas the information classified or not?\n\nThe Trump administration maintains the information shared in the chat was not classified.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that \"no war plans\" were discussed on the chat. Instead, she characterised the information shared as \"sensitive policy discussions\".\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told lawmakers during a congressional hearing that the Signal chat was \"candid and sensitive\", though \"no classified information was shared\".\n\nBut under questioning, she and CIA Director John Ratcliffe appeared uncertain about the classification of the attack plan. They later emphasised that Hegseth had the power to classify and declassify the type of details that were shared.\n\nHegseth has denied sharing classified material, but experts are sceptical that this type of sensitive information would not carry that kind of designation.\n\nJamil Jaffer, executive director of the National Security Institute at George Mason University, said that Hegseth did not send \"an operational plan for World War Three, or for the Pacific region\".\n\n\"But at the same time,\" Mr Jaffer said, \"these are operational details that could, if released publicly, put American lives at risk or jeopardise the success of the operation.\"\n\nWho added Goldberg to the group and why?\n\nIn his original article, Mr Goldberg reports that on 11 March he initially \"received a connection request on Signal from a user identified as Michael Waltz\", Trump's national security adviser.\n\nTwo days later, he writes that he received a notice that he was to be included in a Signal group titled the \"Houthi PC small group.\"\n\nMr Goldberg reports that the group received a message from Waltz, which also noted one of his deputies was \"pulling together\" a team of top staffers relevant to the discussion.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump suggested that a \"lower level\" staffer for Waltz added Mr Goldberg to the chat.\n\nHowever, Waltz himself told Fox News' Laura Ingraham: \"I take full responsibility. I built the - I built the group.\"\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, who was also in the group, said on Wednesday that someone had made a \"mistake\" in adding Mr Goldberg.\n\nWill there be a congressional investigation?\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the Republican-controlled Congress will launch oversight investigations.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have emphatically supported the Trump administration's agenda to this point, so it seems improbable that they would support investigations into the Signal chat.\n\nDemocrats in the House are reportedly trying to force a vote on a \"Resolution of Inquiry\" that would require the Trump administration to hand over records related to the incident, according to Reuters, but they do not have a majority.\n\nWhile some Republicans have raised concerns over the leak, few have appeared eager to cross the president.\n\nHow extensive is the Trump administration's use of Signal?\n\nThe use of Signal to discuss the Houthi strikes posed broader questions about how Trump's top staffers are sharing and discussing sensitive information.\n\nGabbard testified on Wednesday that Signal came \"pre-installed on government devices\".\n\nShe cited guidance from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which mentioned Signal as an example of a messaging service with end-to-end encryption.\n\nRatcliffe earlier testified to Congress that Signal had been installed on his devices when he took over the CIA.\n\nBut it remains uncertain if security officials had provided guidance about using Signal for discussing military operations like the strikes against the Houthis.\n\n\"Whether these circumstances were approved or not is still not clear,\" Mr Jaffer said.\n\nCBS News, the BBC's US partner, has reported that the US National Security Agency had warned employees against using Signal due to \"a vulnerability\" that they had identified."

        "full_text": "On Monday, the Trump administration struck back at the legal-industrial complex's war against MAGA. President Donald Trump's Justice Department filed an emergency request asking the Supreme Court to take a stand on the \"epidemic\" of national injunctions that leftist district court judges are using to halt the Trump agenda.\n\nTrump's lawyers said on Monday that only the Supreme Court can stop this \"power grab.\"\n\nThe success of Trump's presidency could hinge on whether the court will come down hard on this cozy collusion between anti-Trump litigants and injunction-happy judges.\n\nIn Monday's emergency application, Trump's Solicitor General Sarah Harris challenged a San Francisco district court judge's injunction preventing federal offices in all 50 states, including Agriculture, Defense, Treasury and Commerce, from downsizing.\n\nIn February, as the downsizing began, government unions and nonprofits sued in the Northern District of California, notorious for its leftist bias. They were immediately rewarded for their court shopping.\n\nA sympathetic judge, William Alsup, commanded that the Trump administration hire back all 16,000 terminated provisional employees and indicated he would micromanage each reinstatement.\n\nNever mind that the public had just elected a president who promised smaller, more affordable government.\n\nWhile Harris' emergency appeal was landing at the Supreme Court on Monday, down the street at the U.S. Court of Appeals, leftist judicial militancy was on full display.\n\nAppeals Court Judge Patricia Millett was excoriating the president's deportation of suspected Tren De Aragua gang members using the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nAt issue was a nationwide injunction imposed by a district court judge — James Boasberg — halting the president's deportations. The act empowers the president to arrest, detain and deport noncitizens the president believes pose a risk to the nation during war, invasion or any enemy incursion.\n\nThat includes mass invasions across the southern border.\n\nTrump's lawyers went to the Court of Appeals to ask that Boasberg's injunction be lifted, calling it an \"unprecedented and enormous intrusion\" on the commander-in-chief's authority.\n\nMillett shut her ears to that constitutional issue and insisted instead on advocating for the 250-plus gang members already deported to an El Salvadoran prison.\n\n\"There were plane loads of people. There were no procedures in place to notify people,\" Millett said, chastising Trump's lawyers. \"Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act than has happened here.\"\n\nSorry, Judge. Cry me a river.\n\nAs Trump border czar Tom Homan said, Tren de Aragua is \"a designated terrorist organization.\" Homan slammed a reporter reiterating the judge's sob story about the deportees. \"Talk to Laken Riley's family. What due process did she have?\"\n\nTruth is, the Alien Enemies Act does not require any regulations like Millett suggested. The president's discretion is \"as unlimited as the legislature could make it,\" a federal court ruled in Lockington v. Smith. When the act was challenged during World War II in Ludecke v. Watkins, the Supreme Court ruled again that some statutes \"preclude judicial review.\"\n\nMillett tried to weasel around these precedents, claiming she was questioning not the law but only the president's implementation of it. It's a distinction with no difference.\n\nNo court has ever struck down the implementation of the Alien Enemies Act, per the left-leaning Brennan Center for Justice. The law does not guarantee individualized hearings before deportation, or a burden of proof government must satisfy.\n\nAt Monday's hearing, Millett showed herself to be a left-wing firebrand. But another judge on the three-member panel, Justin Walker, nailed the American Civil Liberties Union lawyers representing the deportees, asking why they didn't bring a habeas corpus action in Texas, where the deportation flights originated.\n\nIn response, the ACLU offered only doubletalk because the truth is, they went court shopping.\n\nNow we wait. The three-judge panel has yet to rule on whether to lift Boasberg's nationwide injunction. Until then, deportation of Tren de Aragua using the Alien Enemies Act is on hold.\n\nEven more critical is the Supreme Court's response to Trump's emergency petition. Dozens of federal judges are blocking policies — from downsizing government to ending DEI and evicting gangs — that voters chose when they elected Trump.\n\nFour justices are on the record expressing concern about national injunctions. It's time to act.\n\nAs the lefties are always claiming — but this time it's true — democracy is at stake."

Khalil also allegedly lied about his involvement with a Columbia University coalition of anti-Israel student organizations.\n\nThe Justice Department said Khalil failed to mention he worked in the Syria office of the British embassy in Lebanon.\n\nThey also accuse Khalil of being a member of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees, which UNRWA denies.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio has defended Khalil’s arrest, writing on X earlier this month: “We will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.”\n\nICE arrests students connected to protests\n\nSince then, ICE agents have arrested Yunseo Chung, a 21-year-old Columbia student and lawful permanent resident from South Korea, and Georgetown University professor and Indian national Badar Khan Suri.\n\nBoth were accused of supporting Hamas, but the government hasn’t shown any evidence to support those accusations.\n\nAttorneys for Yunseo Chung filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump and other top officials alleging government overreach for seeking Chung’s deportation. The complaint comes after Trump said the arrest of Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil would be the “first of many to come.”\n\nJust this week, ICE agents in Boston sparked outrage after Tufts University PhD student Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish national, was arrested by plainclothes agents outside her apartment Tuesday.\n\nVideo obtained by The Associated Press appears to show six people, their faces covered, taking away Ozturk’s phone as she yells and is handcuffed.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to NewsNation’s request for comment on cases involving those claiming to be targeted. They have issued previous statements about the arrests."

The leak of military operations information is viewed as a very or somewhat serious problem by 89% of Democrats, 72% of Independents, and 60% of Republicans.\n\nMore Americans are concerned about the Trump administration's military planning leak than the share who said they were concerned about Hillary Clinton using personal email to conduct government business as Secretary of State, according to surveys in 2015 and 2022. The last time YouGov asked about Clinton's private email server was in September 2022, at which point 62% of Americans, 40% of Democrats, and 88% of Republicans viewed it as a very or somewhat serious problem. And in March 2015 — the first time YouGov asked Americans to weigh in on the Clinton email scandal — even fewer viewed her behavior as a serious problem: 56% of Americans, 36% of Democrats, and 79% of Republicans.\n\nWhen we first asked a similar question about Clinton's behavior in 2015 — that is, whether she broke the law by using a personal email for work while she was Secretary of State — 41% of Americans believed she had broken the law and 28% believed she did not.\n\n37% of Americans believe that the media is not making enough of a big deal about Trump administration officials inadvertently including a journalist in their unsecured group chat, while 22% think the media is making too much of a big deal, and 17% think reporting has been just about right.\n\nFewer say the media is making too big of a deal about the Trump administration scandal than said the same about the Clinton scandal in 2016 (22% vs. 37%). Currently, 42% of Republicans think the media is making too big of a deal about the Trump leak; in 2016, 6% said the same about Clinton's emails. Among Democrats, 9% think the media is making too big of a deal about the Trump leak, compared to 69% who thought so about Clinton's emails."

        "full_text": "Despite years of flip flopping on their own reports, National Public Radio (NPR) CEO Katherine Maher told Congressional lawmakers Wednesday — without hesitation — that the outlet is a “nonpartisan organization” free from political bias.\n\nMaher testified before the House Oversight Subcommittee regarding NPR’s government funding, working alongside the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to address wasteful spending. When pressed by Republican Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan on whether she believed the outlet was biased, Maher denied ever seeing political bias influence editorial decisions, insisting NPR has remained “nonpartisan.”\n\nNPR, however, has repeatedly refused to acknowledge or had to correct its own reporting, and it has been consistently accused of having a left-wing bias in its coverage.\n\nIn April 2024, veteran NPR editor Uri Berliner blew the whistle on the outlet’s inner workings, revealing to The Free Press that NPR actively sought to take down President Donald Trump over Russia-collusion allegations — only for those claims to be debunked later. (RELATED: ‘It’s Bullsh*t!’: Jasmine Crockett Shrieks At GOP For Wanting To Cut NPR, PBS Funding)\n\n1. NPR Publishes False Report About Don Jr.\n\nIn November 2018, NPR asserted that Donald Trump Jr. lied to the Senate Judiciary Committee during his September 2017 testimony about plans for a Trump Tower in Moscow, basing their claim on discrepancies with former Trump attorney Michael Cohen’s plea deal.\n\nThe report emerged amid widespread corporate media speculation that Trump’s first campaign colluded with Russia — claims that were later debunked.\n\nHowever, the outlet failed to recognize that the quote they cited from Trump Jr.’s testimony referred to a different project. While NPR issued an extensive editor’s note five hours later, they never retracted the piece.\n\n“An earlier version of this report mischaracterized an answer Donald Trump Jr. gave to Senate investigators in 2017 about the prospective projects his family was negotiating with people in Moscow,” the note says. “Trump Jr. did not address what Cohen has now admitted — that talks about such a deal continued at least into June 2016, longer than previously known and well into the presidential campaign.”\n\n2. NPR Refuses To Cover Hunter Biden Laptop Story\n\nIn October 2019, NPR announced it would not cover Hunter Biden’s infamous laptop after The New York Post broke the story. At the time, the outlet’s managing editor for news, Terence Samuel, explained the decision by saying they didn’t “want to waste” their “time on stories that are not really stories,” nor “waste the listeners’ and readers’ time on stories that are just pure distractions.”\n\n“And quite frankly, that’s where we ended up, this was … a politically driven event, and we decided to treat it that way,” Samuel added.\n\nWhile corporate media was delayed in covering the laptop, and social media platforms at the time censored the story, former President Joe Biden’s Department of Justice later acknowledged the legitimacy of the laptop’s data for the first time in January 2024.\n\n3. Seattle Area NPR Stops Airing COVID Press Conferences\n\nAfter the United States went under a lockdown due to COVID-19, the outlet’s Seattle-area station decided to stop airing the first Trump administration’s coronavirus task force press briefings. While the White House at the time called out the Seattle-area NPR for a “failure of their duty to the American people,” the station claimed it was stopping over a pattern of “false or misleading information.”\n\n“After airing the White House briefings live for two weeks, a pattern of false information and exaggeration increasingly had many at KUOW questioning whether these briefings were in the best service of our mission—to create and serve a more informed public. Of even greater concern was the potential impact of false information on the health and safety of our community,” the station wrote.\n\nThe Seattle-area NPR said at the time that while they cut the daily live briefings, they would be continuing to cover them, but only as they were “fact-checked,” which they noted was a “challenge during a live broadcast.”\n\n4. NPR Downplays COVID Lab Leak Theory\n\nDuring questions regarding the origins of COVID-19, NPR was among the corporate outlets to quickly release reports downplaying the idea that the virus had come from a lab in China.\n\nThe outlet at the time had published two articles titled, “Scientists Debunk Lab Accident Theory Of Pandemic Emergence” and “Virus Researchers Cast Doubt On Theory Of Coronavirus Lab Accident.” Both reports cited scientists dismissing how COVID-19 could have come from a lab.\n\n“They believe the close interactions of people with wildlife worldwide are a far more likely culprit,” one of the articles said.\n\nIn 2021, the outlet later hosted Director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ Global Health Policy Center J. Stephen Morrison, who admitted scientists had rejected the lab theory due to their dislike of Trump.\n\n5. NPR Ends Up Fact-Checking Itself While Trying To Own Trump\n\nIn January, NPR contradicted its own reporting on the astronauts stranded at the International Space Station (ISS) while attempting to fact-check Trump.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote that he asked billionaire Elon Musk to ‘go get’ American astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams after they had been ‘virtually abandoned.’ In response, NPR published a headline claiming the astronauts were ‘not stranded.’\n\nHowever, while denying they were stranded, NPR linked back to its own reports stating that the space travelers were, in fact, stranded.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.\n\nNow that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate media and joining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes to marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; senators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want to limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our independence.\n\nWe don't complain -- we can't stand complainers -- but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our hands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.\n\nWe're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates them -- because we won’t bend the knee to political correctness.\n\nOne reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of our being, and we think she's worth saving from today’s craziness.\n\nHelp us save her.\n\nA second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train. We have trained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political spectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There’s a good chance they were trained at Daily Caller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, Newsmax, Daily Wire and many others.\n\nSimply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a fair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.\n\nSince 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. And we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible to ignore.\n\nWe can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can’t do it unless you — the everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment — have our back.\n\nPlease consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, corporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new generation of news reporters who will actually tell the truth. And help us remind Americans everywhere that there are millions of us who remain clear-eyed about our country's greatness.\n\nIn return for membership, Daily Caller Patriots will be able to read The Daily Caller without any of the ads that we have long used to support our mission. We know the ads drive you crazy. They drive us crazy too. But we need revenue to keep the fight going. If you join us, we will cut out the ads for you and put every Lincoln-headed cent we earn into amplifying our voice, training even more solid reporters, and giving you the ad-free experience and lightning fast website you deserve.\n\nPatriots will also be eligible for Patriots Only content, newsletters, chats and live events with our reporters and editors. It's simple: welcome us into your lives, and we'll welcome you into ours.\n\nWe can save America together.\n\nBecome a Daily Caller Patriot today.\n\nNeil Patel"

        "full_text": "A doctoral student from the University of Alabama has been detained by federal immigration authorities, according to the school.\n\nAlireza Doroudi, an Iranian national studying mechanical engineering, was taken into custody by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers at his off-campus home in Tuscaloosa around 5 a.m. Tuesday, UA’s student paper The Crimson White reported.\n\nUniversity officials confirmed that a graduate student had been detained by federal immigration authorities, but did not confirm the identity, citing privacy reasons.\n\nICE records show that a person named Alireza Doroudi is currently “in custody,” but does not say where he is being held, according to Al.com.\n\nIt’s unclear exactly why Doroudi was detained.\n\nDoroudi entered the US in Jan. 2023 and learned six months later that his F-1 student visa had been revoked, according to the Crimson White.\n\nThe Iranian contacted UA’s International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS). The department told him that the notification was not a major issue and that he could remain in the US as long as he maintained his student status, the paper reported.\n\n“Federal privacy laws limit what can be shared about an individual student,” UA spokesman Alex House said in a statement.\n\n“International students studying at the University are valued members of the campus community, and International Student and Scholar Services is available to assist international students who have questions. UA has and will continue to follow all immigration laws and cooperate with federal authorities.”\n\nThe Post has reached out to ICE and DHS for additional information on the arrest.\n\nDoroudi is one of several international graduate students detained under President Trump’s new crackdown on immigration.\n\nThe president has pledged to deport foreign anti-Israel protesters in the US, accusing them of antisemitism, supporting Hamas and threatening to U.S. foreign policy.\n\nEarlier this month, Columbia University graduate student and anti-Israel protester Mahmoud Khalil was detained by ICE for his role organizing demonstrations at the New York City Ivy League school. The Syrian national, who has a green card, is being held in Louisiana although he has not been charged with any crimes.\n\nRumeysa Ozturk, Tufts University Ph.D. student from Turkey, was taken by ICE agents off the Boston streets on Wednesday after the Trump administration “terminated” her student visa over her alleged “activities in support of Hamas,” the Department of Homeland Security said."

        "full_text": "The US Department of Health and Human Services announced Thursday that it is cutting 10,000 full-time employees across health agencies, the department told CNN.\n\nThis comes on top of 10,000 employees who’ve left voluntarily, shrinking the workforce from about 82,000 full-time employees to 62,000.\n\nIn addition, there are about 5,200 probationary workers, who have been in their positions less than a year or two and were terminated last month. Most are on temporary administrative leave as their fate winds its way through federal courts. They are not included in the latest announcement, HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon said.\n\nThe cuts were first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn its announcement, HHS said it will consolidate from 28 to 15 divisions, including a new Administration for a Healthy America, and will reduce regional offices from 10 to five. The workforce reduction will save $1.8 billion per year, the agency said.\n\nHHS’s new priority will be to end “America’s epidemic of chronic illness by focusing on safe, wholesome food, clean water, and the elimination of environmental toxins,” the agency said.\n\n“We aren’t just reducing bureaucratic sprawl. We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic,” HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a statement. “This Department will do more – a lot more – at a lower cost to the taxpayer.”\n\nBut the agency also said that it will ensure that Medicare, Medicaid and other essential health services will “remain intact” in the restructuring.\n\nAfter the cuts were announced Thursday, public health experts said that maintaining services would be a challenge — or impossible — based on the existing public health workload, steep reductions in funding to state and local health departments and possible cuts to Medicaid.\n\n“Reducing duplication and improving government efficiency is needed, the question is consequences,” said Brian Castrucci, president and CEO of the de Beaumont Foundation, a nonprofit that studies and supports the US public health workforce. “Cutting your home budget might be a good idea, but not if it means your kids starve. Makes one wonder who will be left at HHS to lead their efforts to Make America Healthy Again.”\n\nIn a video posted on X on Thursday, Kennedy acknowledged it will be a “painful period” as health agencies shrink but promised they would be more efficient, do more with less and focus on the new mission.\n\n“No American is going to be left behind,” Kennedy said in the video.\n\n“I want every HHS employee to wake up every morning asking themselves, what can I do to restore American health today?”\n\nThousands of jobs cut across agencies\n\nHHS said Thursday that cuts will include:\n\nAmong the changes will be the new Administration for a Healthy America, which will combine the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. HHS said it will focus on areas such as primary care, maternal and child health, mental health, environmental health, HIV/AIDS and workforce development.\n\nHHS will also create a new assistant secretary for enforcement, who will oversee the Office for Civil Rights, the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals and the Departmental Appeals Board.\n\nA new Office of Strategy will combine the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality “to enhance research that informs the Secretary’s policies and improves the effectiveness of federal health programs.”\n\nThe Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, which handles disaster and public health emergency responses, will move under the CDC. About 1,000 employees will move to the CDC as part of the change.\n\nThe Administration for Community Living, which support older adults and people with disabilities, will be integrated into other HHS agencies.\n\nAt the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the cuts will weigh heavily on caseworkers and account management teams, according to a former HHS employee. Caseworkers assist Affordable Care Act health plan consumers and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries with enrollment if they can’t be helped by call center personnel. And account management teams deal with health insurance plans to make sure they are complying with regulations and to answer their questions.\n\n“Service standards for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries and Affordable Care Act consumers will suffer with a reduction in the people that handle their cases and with diminished oversight of the Medicare Advantage plans,” the person said.\n\nEmployee notices to go out as soon as Friday\n\nHHS sent a formal reduction in force, or RIF, notice to American Federation of Government Employees union leaders early Thursday morning.\n\nAbout 8,000 to 10,000 employees will be affected by the layoffs, with the probable effective date being May 27, said the email, which was sent by Thomas J. Nagy Jr., deputy assistant secretary for human resources at HHS, and viewed by CNN.\n\nSpecific notices to employees may be sent as soon as Friday, the email said.\n\nThe reductions are mainly aimed at administrative jobs, including human resources, information technology, procurement and finance, according to the email. It will also target roles in high-cost regions and employees in areas that have been deemed redundant or duplicative within HHS or across the federal government.\n\nHHS is still finalizing the list of so-called “competitive areas,” which defines the organizational or geographical scope in which employees compete for positions during a RIF, the email said.\n\nThe union was asked to advise if or when it would like to start negotiating on impact and implementation.\n\nThe National Treasury Employees Union, which also represents workers at the agency, called the plan “disastrous” and vowed to fight for its members and HHS’ overall mission.\n\n“The American people do not support indiscriminate cuts curtailing or eliminating local health programs, endangering the health and safety of children and families, and inflicting real economic harm in small towns and big cities across the country,” union National President Doreen Greenwald said in a statement.\n\nHeavy workloads and impacts to care\n\nChiquita Brooks-LaSure, former administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, likened the cuts to a “wrecking ball.”\n\n“Any cut you make to a health agency should be done with incredible care and consideration for the hundreds of millions of Americans who rely on their work to stay healthy and get treatment when they’re sick,” Brooks-LaSure, now a fellow at the Century Foundation, said in a statement. “We certainly have progress to make to ensure every American can access safe, affordable, timely health care, but laying off thousands of people working toward that progress doesn’t move us forward.”\n\nDr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said morale at public health agencies was already the “lowest it’s ever been” as people struggle with heavy workloads.\n\n“I’ve done big reorganizations before. You have to do them very, very carefully, very deliberately. Every time you move the boxes around, every time you downsize or upsize organizations, you make them dysfunctional for some period of time,” he said.\n\nWith the confirmation of staffing cuts and defunding of state health agencies, Benjamin said American life expectancy would almost certainly get worse, not better, as a result of these changes.\n\n“Not only are they breaking the federal infrastructure, but they just broke the state and local infrastructure on top of this, so the states and locals can’t even pick up the slack,” Benjamin said.\n\nThe personnel reductions “will ultimately affect government services and be felt by the public and health care providers,” said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a nonpartisan health research group.\n\n“Reductions in the federal workforce may seem more efficient, but it could result in more wasteful spending down the road,” Levitt said. “New efforts to improve healthy behaviors may work at cross purposes to dramatic reductions in federal programs and big cuts to Medicaid being considered by Congress.”\n\nDr. Stella Dantas, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in a statement that the the “work and expertise of HHS staff are critical to the well-being of our entire population—and to physicians’ ability to provide care to patients.”\n\nThe cuts were “alarming,” she said, and risk “reverberating damage” to the US health system now and in the future: “This attack on public health—and HHS’ ability to advance it—will hurt people across the United States every single day.”\n\nAmerica’s Essential Hospitals, the trade association for hospitals that care for low-income and uninsured people, also voiced concerns that the restructuring could “compromise the infrastructure needed to serve patients effectively.”\n\n“Assistance from federal partners is key for our hospitals to ensure that low-income and older Americans have access to health care,” Beth Feldpush, the group’s senior vice president of policy and advocacy, said in a statement."

        "full_text": "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is under close scrutiny as Republican lawmakers criticize his handling of sensitive military information in a group chat with other administration officials that inadvertently included a journalist.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have stopped short of calling on Hegseth to resign, but they’re warning that his decision to share sensitive details about a pending military strike against Houthi rebels in Yemen over Signal, a commercial app, is a clear “strike” against him.\n\n“I think they should make sure it never happens again. I wish they’d tell us, ‘It will never happen again.’ It’s the first strike in the early stages of an administration,” said Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. “Don’t let it ever happen again.”\n\n“I don’t know how many strikes you get. In baseball, you get three. Maybe this is worth two,” he added. “If mistakes like this continue to happen, we’ll deal with them as it happens. My hope and my expectation is that it won’t.”\n\nAnother Republican senator said President Trump is “not happy” but noted that so far, the president is sticking by Hegseth and national security adviser Mike Waltz, who reportedly assembled the group chat, which included Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic.\n\nTrump on Tuesday downplayed the controversy, calling it “the only glitch in two months.”\n\nGOP senators are questioning Hegseth’s judgment in the whole affair.\n\nThey’re scratching their heads over his decision to divulge sensitive details about when attack fighter jets would launch and when strike drones would reach their targets on a commercial app, which was then accessed by at least two recipients’ private phones.\n\nAnd they’re wondering about Hegseth’s response to reporters’ questions, specifically his adamant denial that “nobody’s texting war plans” after a National Security Council spokesperson had confirmed the chat group’s reported texts appeared to be “authentic.”\n\n“The worst part of it is Hegseth saying himself, ‘This didn’t really happen.’ Why don’t you just admit it?” one Republican senator remarked.\n\n“It’s going to have to be investigated,” the source added.\n\nHegseth’s defiant insistence on a tarmac in Hawaii on Monday that he didn’t text any war plans provoked eye rolls from prominent commentators such as Fox News’s Brit Hume, who reposted a video of Hegseth’s comments on the social platform X and wrote: “Oh for God’s sake.”\n\nHume on Wednesday criticized the administration for “making a mess” of responding to the scandal by getting “bogged down in a dispute over whether the details of Yemen bombing raids were a war plan and whether those details were, or should have been, classified,” thereby prolonging the story.\n\nRepublican senators said privately they couldn’t imagine Hegseth’s predecessors, such as former secretaries of Defense Robert Gates and Jim Mattis, making similar mistakes.\n\nAnd while White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday sought to draw a distinction between “war plans” and “attack plans” in criticizing The Atlantic’s reporting, Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) told reporters that the information, however it might be described, should have been classified.\n\n“The information as published recently appears to me to be of such a sensitive nature that, based on my knowledge, I would have wanted it classified,” Wicker said at the Capitol.\n\nWicker and Sen. Jack Reed (R.I.), the top-ranking Democrat on the Armed Services panel, said Wednesday they would send a letter to the Defense Department asking the administration to “expedite” an inspector general report on the security lapse and ask for a classified briefing on the matter.\n\nWicker said he and Reed are working on another letter to ask that the senior officials preserve all records of their Signal conversations.\n\n“We’re working on a different letter about preservation of documents, and we’re going to have a classified briefing,” Wicker said Wednesday afternoon. “We have agreed to a process and we’re pursuing it.\n\n“We are commissioning fact-finding oversight processes,” he added.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) said Hegseth and other senior Trump officials need to acknowledge they made a serious mistake.\n\n“I think the important thing here is: These guys, they made a mistake. They know it. They should own it and fix it so it never happens again,” Thune told reporters Wednesday.\n\nThe big question is what the scandal means for Hegseth’s continued leadership at the Pentagon, after his nomination squeaked through the Senate in late January.\n\nVice President Vance had to break a tie vote to get Hegseth confirmed after three Republicans — Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Mitch McConnell (Ky.) — voted no.\n\nMcConnell, the chair of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, argued in a statement at the time that Hegseth was not ready for the “massive and solemn responsibility” of managing 3 million military civilian personnel and an annual budget of $1 trillion.\n\n“Mere desire to be a ‘change agent’ is not enough to fill these shoes,” McConnell warned. “Mr. Hegseth has failed, as yet, to demonstrate that he will pass the test. But as he assumes office, the consequences of failure are as high as they have ever been.”\n\nCollins, the chair of the Appropriations Committee and a senior member of the Intelligence panel, called the discussion of sensitive details on a commercial app “egregious.”\n\nBut she said it’s up to Trump whether Hegseth — and Waltz, for that matter — should continue serving in their current roles.\n\n“That’s not my call, that’s the president’s call. I do think this was an egregious compromise of national security,” she said.\n\nSeveral prominent Democrats, including Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), have called on Hegseth to be removed from his position.\n\n“He should be fired,” Schumer told reporters Wednesday.\n\nJeffries wrote in a letter to Trump that Hegseth’s “continued presence in the top position of leadership at the Pentagon threatens the nation’s security and puts our brave men and women in uniform throughout the world in danger.”\n\nSen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who wrestled over how to vote on Hegseth’s nomination earlier this year, told reporters Wednesday that he doesn’t regret his decision to vote to confirm him.\n\nBut he said if the information discussed on the chat was classified, “it’s a serious issue.”\n\n“The best way to end a crisis is to look right at it and get the facts out,” he advised. “I think it would be good just to shut it down. It’ll just end the intrigue and we can get back to fulfilling the promises we made last year that got us elected.”\n\nTillis asked why operational details needed to be shared outside the strike force just before the attack was scheduled to take place.\n\n“The question that I had was, ‘Why share any of that information with anyone that close to the execution of kinetic strike unless they were material to the execution of the operation?’ So, it just seems like it was an unnecessary communication,” he said.\n\nSen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), who cast a critical vote for Hegseth’s nomination as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Trump should decide how to handle what’s next for his national security team, and any potential consequences.\n\nAsked if Hegseth or Waltz should resign, Ernst said: “No, this is up to the president.”\n\n“Let it rest for a minute. We know that the [National Security Council] is probing into this. Once they’re done, I know they will fully inform the president of what has happened,” she said.\n\nSen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a senior member of the Intelligence Committee, called the national security lapse “a screwup” but pushed back on the notion that Hegseth or Waltz should step down.\n\n“It was a screwup. They’ll fix it and move on,” he said.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a prominent Senate voice on national security matters, said in a statement that he would continue to support “all members of President Trump’s national security team.”\n\n“However, recent revelations about the content of the texts — while not discussing war plans per se — do in fact detail very sensitive information about a planned an ongoing military operation,” he said.\n\nGraham later told reporters Trump should “stick” with his team but stressed the need to “learn” from mistakes.\n\n“Don’t say this was perfect, because it wasn’t,” he said."

        "full_text": "Robert F Kennedy Jr said the nation’s health agencies will cut 10,000 jobs from their 82,000-person workforce – an enormous reduction the US health secretary characterized as streamlining federal bureaucracy amid internal resistance to the administration’s agenda.\n\nThe cuts announced on Thursday, along with previous restructuring and voluntary buyouts, mean the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will lose roughly 20,000 workers.\n\nKennedy said the department will also close half of its regional offices and create a new agency called the “administration for a healthy America”, or AHA.\n\n“We aren’t just reducing bureaucratic sprawl. We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic,” Kennedy said on Thursday morning.\n\nHHS is among the largest branches of the federal government, overseeing a $1.7tn budget and agencies that are household names. Among the agencies under HHS’s oversight are the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nThe critical work performed by these agencies includes protecting Americans from outbreaks and infectious disease at the CDC, helming the world’s largest publicly funded biomedical and behavioral research agency at the NIH, providing health insurance to 137 million Americans through the public programs Medicare and Medicaid at the CMS, and approving and regulating the nation’s medical devices, drugs and foods at the FDA.\n\nDonald Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk, who oversees the massive federal job-cutting initiative via the unofficial “department of government efficiency”, have been gutting agencies as part of an effort to shrink the federal bureaucracy, with cuts that have roiled health agencies in particular.\n\n“Any cut you make to a health agency should be done with incredible care and consideration for the hundreds of millions of Americans who rely on their work to stay healthy and get treatment when they’re sick,” said Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, previously the Biden administration’s CMS administrator and now a senior fellow at the Century Foundation. Taking a “wrecking ball” to health agencies and “laying off thousands of people … doesn’t move us forward”, Brooks-LaSure said.\n\nIn his announcement, Kennedy also alluded to internal resistance to the upheaval at HHS, saying: “In one case, defiant bureaucrats impeded the secretary’s office from accessing the closely guarded databases that might reveal the dangers of certain drugs and medical interventions.” Kennedy did not specify the databases or medical interventions in question.\n\nIn a description of the cuts, HHS said it plans to eliminate 3,500 full-time employees at the FDA. The administration claimed the cuts would not affect inspectors or drug, medical device and food reviewers. The CDC will lose 2,400 staff members, with the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response folded into the CDC. The NIH will lose a further 1,200 employees across its 27 institutes and centers. The CMS will lose 300 people. HHS did not provide a detailed breakdown of the programs, services or roles to be cut.\n\n“We are getting panicked calls from our health agencies about what funding is going to get cut off,” said Democratic US senator Patty Murray of Washington state, noting the country is in the midst of a severe flu season and expanding measles outbreak in west Texas. Murray added the administration’s move appears to be an illegal “impounding” of funds allocated by Congress.\n\nThe restructuring will also consolidate 28 branches of the department into 15 new divisions, including the new AHA. AHA will combine offices in HHS that address addiction, mental health, toxic substances and occupational safety, among others, into one central office, the agency said. The new units will also centralize functions such as external affairs, human resources and IT, HHS said.\n\n“Today’s announcement is not just a restructuring of the Department of Health and Human Services, it is a catastrophe for the health of every American,” said Democratic senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts. “Kennedy, Musk and Trump only serve themselves and the wealthiest people in our country.”\n\nWhile Democrats argued the downsizings are in service of extending tax cuts to the wealthy, consumer advocates also sounded alarms, arguing mass layoffs will inevitably close programs.\n\nThe consumer group Public Citizen said cuts to the FDA increase “the chances that more unsafe drugs and medical devices will be marketed and that all of us will suffer preventable diseases”.\n\nThe massive restructuring comes as research funding is under threat. The NIH canceled nearly 400 active grants since the administration took the reins, with diversity, equity and inclusion programs; transgender issues; and research into South Africa and now Covid-19 as targets for defunding. The Office of Long Covid Research and Practice announced this week it would be shuttered as part of the reorganization.\n\nA report in Nature on Wednesday revealed that federal workers who manage the government’s research investments with scientists had been directed to cancel Covid-19 research grants, a category potentially encompassing $850m and more than 600 projects. Funding freezes at the same agency have thrown into upheaval critical research on diseases as diverse as pediatric cancer and Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nDo you have a tip on this issue?

        "full_text": "Germany has said it \"will not give in\" and that Europe must \"respond firmly\" as US President Donald Trump targets imported cars and car parts with a 25% tax in his latest tariffs.\n\nOther major world economies have vowed to retaliate, with France's president branding the move \"a waste of time\" and \"incoherent\", Canada calling it a \"direct attack\", and China accusing Washington of violating international trade rules.\n\nCarmaker stocks from Japan to Germany dipped. In the US, General Motors dropped 7%, while Ford fell more than 2%.\n\nTrump has threatened to impose \"far larger\" tariffs if Europe works with Canada to do what he describes as \"economic harm\" to the US.\n\nThe fresh car tariffs will come into effect on 2 April, with charges on businesses importing vehicles starting the next day. Taxes on parts are set to start in May or later.\n\nTrump has long maintained the tariffs are part of a drive to help US manufacturing and says if cars are made in America there will be \"absolutely no tariff\".\n\nTariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.\n\nWhile the measures can protect domestic businesses, they also raise costs for companies reliant on parts from abroad.\n\nThe firms that bring the foreign goods into the country pay the tax to the government. Firms may choose to pass on some or all of the cost of tariffs to customers.\n\nThe US imported about eight million cars last year - accounting for about $240bn (£186bn) in trade and roughly half of overall sales.\n\nMexico is the top supplier of cars to the US, followed by South Korea, Japan, Canada and Germany.\n\nAnalysts have estimated that tariffs on parts just from Canada and Mexico could lead to costs rising by $4,000-$10,000 depending on the vehicle, according to the Anderson Economic Group.\n\nGerman Economy Minister Robert Habeck said the European Union must \"respond firmly\".\n\n\"It must be clear that we will not give in to the US. We need to show strength and self-confidence,\" he added.\n\nFrance backed this joint approach, with its finance minister saying Europe must retaliate with tariffs on US products.\n\nAt a press conference on Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron said it was \"not the time\" for the US to be imposing tariffs.\n\n\"Imposing tariffs means breaking value chains, it means creating in the short term an inflationary effect and destroying jobs,\" he said in Paris.\n\n\"All of this is rather a waste of time and will create a lot of worry,\" he added, urging Trump to reconsider.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called the tariffs a \"direct attack\" on his country and its car industry, adding it \"will hurt us\", but trade options were being discussed.\n\nIn the UK, car industry body the SMMT said the car tariffs announcement was \"not surprising but, nevertheless, disappointing\".\n\nUniparts founder John Neill said the Trump tariffs were \"a gift to the Chinese\", because international consumers would respond to a trade war by buying Chinese alternatives.\n\nMeanwhile, China accused Trump of violating World Trade Organization rules.\n\n\"There are no winners in a trade war or a tariff war. No country's development and prosperity has been achieved by imposing tariffs,\" a spokesman for the foreign ministry said.\n\nThere are warnings from Japan that there will be a \"significant impact\" on the economic relationship it shares with the US. A government spokesman described the measures as \"extremely regrettable\" and said officials had asked the US for an exemption.\n\nIn South Korea, a day before the latest levy, Hyundai announced it would invest $21bn (£16.3bn) in the US and build a new steel plant in Louisiana.\n\nTrump hailed the investment as a \"clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work\".\n\nBosch - based in Germany - said it had confidence in the \"long-term potential\" of the North American market and would continue to expand its business there.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund said it was not projecting a US recession, but warned a trade war could have a \"significant adverse effect\" on Canada and Mexico's economic outlooks."

        "full_text": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a major overhaul Thursday that will eliminate 10,000 full-time employees from his department.\n\nMr. Kennedy also said HHS will consolidate 28 divisions into 15, including a new Administration for a Healthy America, and it will cut the number of regional offices from 10 to five.\n\nDemocrats cried foul, saying the cuts would hollow out the agency while the U.S. is fighting a deadly fentanyl problem, bird flu and measles outbreaks.\n\nMr. Kennedy said the restructuring would make the agency more efficient, leaving popular insurance programs such as Medicaid and Medicare intact while reorienting agency missions toward ending chronic illness and eradicating environmental toxins.\n\n“We aren’t just reducing bureaucratic sprawl. We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic,” Mr. Kennedy said. “This department will do more — a lot more — at a lower cost to the taxpayer.”\n\nThe overhaul is Mr. Kennedy’s latest attempt to “Make America Healthy Again” as part of President Trump’s revamping of the federal government.\n\nSEE ALSO: RFK Jr.’s MAHA movement is already changing how America eats\n\nThe new workforce cuts, along with prior early retirements and moves by the Department of Government Efficiency, will downsize HHS from 82,000 to 62,000 full-time employees, the department said.\n\nMr. Kennedy, in a video explaining the moves, said it might be a “painful” transition for HHS, but he is “keenly focused on paring away excess administrators while increasing the number of scientists and front line health providers so that we can do a better job for the American people.”\n\nMr. Kennedy is earning kudos for his focus on processed foods and general health, but the cuts will likely add to the chorus of critics who say some of the secretary’s views are counterproductive. Some health professionals want him to be more vocal about vaccination as measles outbreaks swirl through western states and other parts of the U.S.\n\nAlso, the administration recently announced the cancellation of billions of dollars of research grants, upsetting scientists who say it could cost lives. The department said much of the funding was for COVID-19 research that is no longer needed.\n\nThe restructuring complies with Mr. Trump’s executive order to optimize the federal workforce through DOGE, a government-cutting initiative led by billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nMr. Trump and Mr. Musk say the government is bloated and rife with fraud.\n\nDemocrats and others say DOGE’s slash-and-burn tactics are cutting critical services and mistreating middle-class federal workers. Critics also say the GOP is trying to free up money for tax-cut legislation that will benefit the wealthy.\n\nHHS broke down the layoffs in major divisions, saying the Food and Drug Administration would see the biggest cut of 3,500 workers, though it insisted the downsizing would not impact drug, medical device and food reviewers, nor would they affect inspectors.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will lose 2,400 employees but remain focused on preparing for and responding to epidemics and outbreaks, the department said. It said the reduction could be considered a 1,400-person reduction because 1,000 people are joining the CDC from the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response as part of the consolidation.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health will reduce its workforce by 1,200 people by “centralizing procurement, human resources, and communications across its 27 institutes and centers,” HHS said, adding that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will cut 300 employees to reduce “minor duplication” across the agency without touching Medicaid and Medicare services.\n\nSen. Angela Alsobrooks, Maryland Democrat, said the cuts would be “dangerous and deadly.”\n\n“I warned America that confirming RFK Jr. would be a mistake,” Ms. Alsobrooks said. “This move must be immediately reversed for the health and safety of the American people. I will do all I can to fight this.”\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, said that “when you fire people who prevent the spread of diseases like measles, America will get sicker.”\n\nMr. Kennedy said the restructuring would produce results.\n\n“Over time, bureaucracies like HHS become wasteful and inefficient even when most of their staff are dedicated and competent civil servants,” he said. “This overhaul will be a win-win for taxpayers and for those that HHS serves.”\n\nThe creation of the Administration for a Healthy America will combine multiple agencies — the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).\n\nCuts at places like the FDA, NIH and CDC produced the biggest waves, however, given their role in regulatory oversight, research on cures and prevention of diseases.\n\nPeter J. Pitts, the president of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest and a former associate commissioner at the FDA, said the announcement seemed to suggest that user fee-funded positions at the FDA would be spared, meaning there could be cuts in the Office of the Commissioner.\n\nThe office includes communications staff, lawyers in the chief counsel’s office and staff in charge of policy and planning.\n\nHe said newly confirmed FDA Commissioner Marty Makary must figure out how to get the most out of the remaining workforce because Mr. Kennedy wants to improve FDA scrutiny of nutrition in regulated products.\n\n“That doesn’t require fewer employees, it requires more employees,” Mr. Pitts said, adding Dr. Makary must decide how to run “a leaner, meaner more effective agency.”"

        "full_text": "Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino.\n\nQuick Take\n\nVice President JD Vance has said White House adviser Elon Musk has made “mistakes” in his work with the Department of Government Efficiency. But social media posts are sharing what experts said is a manipulated audio clip that purports to be Vance making much harsher remarks about Musk. The vice president’s spokesperson called the clip “100% fake.”\n\nFull Story\n\nIn an interview with NBC News aboard Air Force Two on March 14, Vice President JD Vance said that White House adviser Elon Musk has made “mistakes” in his role with the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which has been tasked with reducing the federal workforce and government spending.\n\n“Elon himself has said that sometimes you do something, you make a mistake, and then you undo the mistake. I’m accepting of mistakes,” Vance told NBC News. “I also think you have to quickly correct those mistakes,” the vice president said.\n\nMore recently, viral social media posts have shared a purportedly “leaked” audio clip of Vance expressing much harsher criticism of Musk and his work with DOGE. Experts told us the clip is “likely inauthentic,” and Vance’s spokesperson said it is “100% fake.”\n\nA March 23 Instagram reel that has received nearly 87,000 likes is titled, “LEAKED JD VANCE AUDIO ON ELON MUSK 3/23/25,” and shows side-by-side photos of Musk and Vance. The voice on the reel, which sounds somewhat like Vance, says, in part: “Everything that he’s doing is being criticized in the media. And he says that he’s helping, and he’s not. He’s making us look bad. He’s making me look bad. … He has the audacity to act like he is an elected official. I am an elected official. I am the important one in this situation, not him.”\n\nThe social media posts do not provide the source of the recording — a sign that the content of the posts is not authentic.\n\nNewsweek reported that the bogus audio clip appeared to originate from the account Joseiitalia on TikTok, where it received 1.5 million views, and was shared to X where it received more than 500,000 views.\n\n‘A Growing Trend of Fabricated Leaks’\n\nWe asked GetReal Labs, a company that analyzes manufactured content, whether it could determine the authenticity of the recording. Emmanuelle Saliba, chief investigative officer at GetReal, told us in a March 24 email, “Our team conducted a detailed forensic analysis of the audio. We tracked down the highest-quality version available, isolated the voice and removed background noise. Based on our review, we believe the audio is likely inauthentic.\n\n“The cadence and intonation are not consistent with Vice President Vance’s typical speech patterns. In addition, although we have not performed a full biometric analysis, the identity of the voice in the audio does not sound like Vance,” Saliba said. “The unusually low audio quality — a common trick to conceal evidence of manipulation/synthesis — is also highly suspicious.”\n\nResponding to the social media posts, the vice president’s spokesperson, William Martin, said in a March 23 post on X, “This audio is 100% fake and most certainly not the Vice President.”\n\nSaliba told us, “Audio deepfakes are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and there’s a growing trend of fabricated leaks targeting high-profile politicians and journalists,” including Donald Trump Jr. and James Waterhouse of the BBC. “In both cases, the manipulated audio was traced back to Russian Telegram channels,” she said.\n\nWe recently wrote about social media posts sharing a fake audio clip of Trump Jr. generated using artificial intelligence.\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Meta to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

        "full_text": "The weaponization of government was probably the hallmark of the administration of Joe Biden. OK, the weaponization of government and senile, incoherent ramblings were the hallmarks. While the senile ramblings are gone, the infrastructure of that weaponization remains fully entrenched in agencies across the federal government. President Donald Trump needs to remove any and everyone involved in the effort to not only use the power of government against him for political purposes, but against any American.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWeaponization of government is more than just filing bogus charges or creating new laws under which prosecutions can happen, it involves government creating flaming hoops through which Americans have to jump to open or expand a business, or simply do business with the government itself.\n\nPresident Biden famously attached Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) strings to nearly every government contract – hire this type of person, give to this cause or force your employees to participate in this or that “education” program and you will be deemed worthy of doing business with the very government you fund.\n\nThe Biden administration spent an astonishing $128 million on DEI promotion grants while allocating $42 billion to connect poor and rural Americans to high-speed internet access, but connected no one because no company could meet the standards for DEI they set. They took all the credit for “connecting Americans,” and none of the blame for making that connection impossible through their weaponization efforts.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission now has good, new leadership, but it also has staff that helped implement “net neutrality” twice – the attempt to insert the federal government in the internet, which would naturally lead to taxes and more regulation. Most of all, it would have led to a much slower, worse internet.\n\nThe FCC under Barack Obama tried it, then it was undone under Donald Trump the first time. Then Obama II – Joe Biden – attempted to reinstate them, only to be struck down by the courts just before the start of the second Trump administration.\n\nAnyone pivotal in both attempts, or even in just one of the attempts, should be reassigned, at the very minimum. The best way to mitigate disaster is to get rid of those responsible for it, as history has a habit of repeating itself.\n\nAt the Federal Trade Commission, President Trump has already started to delouse the place by firing the two Democrats on it. Why? Because the government needs a house-cleaning and good kick in the complacency.\n\nThe FTC was very activist-left under its old leadership, the Biden-appointed Lina Khan. The Washington Times described her tenure as having “poisoned the workplace environment and sabotaged its mission because of her reckless disregard for precedent.”\n\nIn what appears to be a nod to the abortion industry, the FTC sued an Idaho-based company called Kochava claiming they were “selling sensitive geolocation data that was being misused for political purposes.”\n\nThe Times reported, “According to the agency, which hasn’t helped matters by its failure to define what it means by ‘sensitive locations,’ the company has the potential to sell geolocation data to political operators around the country who use the data to market products and candidates and address political issues to people who have been shown to have visited Planned Parenthood facilities.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Even if these claims are factual, none of that is illegal,” reports the Times. “Still, Ms. Khan, as she has done many times before, does not shy away from a chance to expand the federal government’s ability to reach into the marketplace and control it. What makes this case a bit strange is that it’s been the Democrats who have made the best use of this kind of information.”\n\nIt’s good that she’s gone, it will be better when the remnants of her tenure and those “below the fold” who participated in her actions are wiped clean too. The best thing that the Trump administration can do now is to instruct his FTC to drop these types of weaponized litigation efforts to free companies from the Biden administration’s attacks.\n\nStep out of line or fail to be sufficiently deferential to whatever the left-wing political whims are at any given moment and your career will be over. It’s weird to see the people taking to the streets claiming to care so deeply about bureaucrats fired by DOGE have no problem with the military men and women discharged for refusing to get a COVID shot, for example. COVID was another political flashpoint for the Biden administration and if you stepped out of line, be prepared to pay hefty legal fees.\n\nIn November 2022, the FTC falsely accused Precision Patient Outcomes, Inc. (PPO), a small, California-based company, of unlawfully marketing and selling a dietary supplement called “Covid Resist,” one which the company never sold. The agency’s lawsuit against PPO and CEO Margrett Lewis was terminated on February 15, 2024. In November 2021, a nasal spray maker Xlear was sued by Biden’s DoJ for “falsely” marketing its saline sprays as an effective way to prevent and treat COVID-19. This lawsuit contradicted the research that the Biden administration itself had produced. In 2020, the National Institutes of Health promoted a clinical trial that proved Xlear sprays helped with overcoming and preventing COVID infections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProgressive activism metastasizes throughout any organization everywhere it is found. It has to be torn out, root and branch, in every little way. Yes, there are bigger and broader examples of this internal rot out there, but the Trump administration is pulling those out. These are a few examples of what needs to come next, and then after that there will be more; there will always be more.\n\nThere is no finish line in the fight against the left weaponizing our government against citizens, only a constant struggle to keep it at bay. It’s thankless work, but as long as we have a massive government trying to impose its will on Americans rather than leaving us alone, it’s some of the most important."

        "full_text": "As President Donald Trump faces stiff challenges from federal judges across the country, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, is laying out a sweeping agenda for judicial reform to rein in judges that he says are being overtly political.\n\nIn just under 65 days of President Trump’s second term, federal judges have issued at least 15 nationwide injunctions, where single judges on the district court level have attempted to block certain administration policies nationwide. Republicans have roundly decried the injunctions because of their sweeping nature and have accused some of the judges of being motivated by politics instead of sound legal arguments.\n\n“[When] you have a judge whose behavior is so politically, so political against President Trump, you kind of got to start asking the question, really, is this just a bad judicial decision, or is this based on politics?” Jordan told the “Just the News, No Noise” TV show on Tuesday.\n\nThree reforms being proposed\n\nJordan, who leads the House committee responsible for overseeing the federal law enforcement and court system, told Just the News that he is planning to address reforms to the judicial system in three ways: passing legislation to limit nationwide injunctions by individual federal judges; wielding Congress’s appropriations power to curtail judicial activism; and conducting hearings on judicial conduct.\n\n“[There’s] three avenues that Congress has to deal with this situation. One is legislative, and we're already working on that. We've passed the bill out of committee two and a half weeks ago that the Speaker has indicated they're gonna put on the floor next week. But that bill says, when you have one of these federal district judges who issues an injunction, you know, some some judge in Timbuktu California issues an injunction, it should only apply to parties in the case and in that respective jurisdiction, it shouldn't have nationwide application. So we think that makes sense,” Jordan said.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee last week approved the “No Rogue Rulings Act of 2025” sponsored by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif. That legislation would curtail federal judges from making nationwide injunctions in the cases before them, “except in the case of such an order that is applicable only to limit the actions of a party to the case before such district court with respect to the party seeking injunctive relief from such district court and non-parties represented by such a party acting in a representative capacity.”\n\nThe bill would provide a new pathway for injunctive relief in cases where three or more states challenge a federal law. In such a case, the challenge would be referred to a three-judge panel selected randomly which would be given the authority to issue the types of nationwide injunctions currently being used by individual federal judges.\n\nThe administration has so far faced dozens of lawsuits, mostly over Trump’s executive orders and the actions of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, resulting in injunctions—known as Temporary Restraining Orders—that freeze administration policies as the case is adjudicated. Most of the injunctions have come from the Democratic-friendly Maryland or DC courts, though their rulings currently apply nationwide, frustrating efforts by Trump to enact his agenda.\n\nThe deportation case\n\nOne case that has garnered nationwide attention is being presided over by Judge James Boasberg of the Washington, D.C., District Court. The case centers around Trump’s invocation of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.\n\nThe administration argued that the judge’s order infringes on the president’s Article II executive powers, leading its lawyers to assert the state secrets privilege to decline to provide additional information on the deportation of the gang members demanded by Boasberg. The Trump administration has appealed the case to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the temporary injunction in a ruling on Wednesday.\n\nBut, if the House Republican bill becomes law, judges like Boasberg would not be able to issue such sweeping injunctions that halt federal policy.\n\nJordan said his committee will also explore ways to use Congress’ appropriations power to exercise influence over judges they believe have gone rogue. Second, “you can look at the appropriations process,” Jordan told the “Just the News, No Noise” TV show.\n\nThe United States Constitution separates the Supreme Court and the Congress, the Founders gave lawmakers the authority to regulate and organize all lower federal courts. This means that Congress is responsible for appropriating funds for federal court budgets—including salaries and other operating expenditures. Every year, Congress passes a judicial budget for the Financial Services and General Government, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nJordan also promised that his committee will conduct oversight hearings on the federal judiciary and the judges that have blocked the Trump administration’s policies.\n\nBoasberg's political background muddies the waters\n\n“[Finally], you do oversight. We're planning hearings. The first hearing would start next week, next Tuesday, and we'll announce those witnesses as soon as we finalize them,” Jordan said. “Then I think in those hearings, we'll focus on the injunction issue, but also into this ruling, this order, from Judge Boasberg, which, I mean, just on its face, is so ridiculous.”\n\nJordan also raised concerns about Boasberg’s history, specifically his role leading the FISA court during the Trump-Russia collusion investigation and attending a junket to an event sponsored by anti-Trump academics and speakers.\n\nIn his role as the head of the FISA Court, Boasberg made a number of divisive decisions, including a slap on the wrist for a member of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane team, the appointment of officials who had defended the FBI’s actions during the Russiagate saga, and the renewal of the FBI’s FISA powers, Just the News reported last week.\n\nBoasberg also attended a privately-funded legal conference in Idaho that featured sponsors and speakers who have expressed clear anti-Trump sentiments — particularly on immigration — and a theme that echoed the Democrat Party’s 2024 stated mission of saving democracy, according to a judicial ethics report, Just the News reported earlier this week.\n\nSome House Republicans have filed articles of impeachment against at least three of the federal judges who have issued injunctions in key cases, including Boasberg. Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, who filed the articles of impeachment, accused him of abuse of power, and asserted that he \"did knowingly and willfully use his judicial position to advance political gain while interfering with the President's constitutional prerogatives and enforcement of the rule of law.”"

        "full_text": "Update: Republished on March 27 as a new warning is issued into dangerous online document websites, with reports into campaigns actively attacking users.\n\nThe raft of recent FBI warnings hitting smartphone and computer users should not be a surprise. The threat landscape is rapidly worsening, whether from Chinese hackers penetrating U.S. networks or unpaid toll scams spiraling out of control. And much more dangerous AI-fueled attacks will soon turn all this up to eleven.\n\nAs I reported last week, the bureau is now warning website users to beware “a scam involving free online document converter tools,” with criminals using “converter tools to load malware onto victims’ computers, leading to incidents such as ransomware.”\n\nForbesGoogle Confirms Chrome Attack Warning—What You Do Now\n\nNow the bureau has confirmed this threat is ongoing, with users continuing to fall victim. “FBI warnings are true,” says Bleeping Computer, “fake file converters do push malware.“ An FBI spokesperson told the site that “the scammers try to mimic URLs that are legit, so changing just one letter, or 'INC’ instead of ‘CO’. Users who in the past would type ‘free online file converter’ into a search engine are vulnerable, as the algorithms used for results now often include paid results, which might be scams.”\n\n“The best way to thwart these fraudsters,” the FBI says, “is to educate people so they don’t fall victim to these fraudsters in the first place. Every day, we are working to hold these scammers accountable and provide victims with the resources they need.” Yes, you should check URLs and avoid free ads topping search. But in reality you should not use online document converters at all — stick to established apps and platforms.\n\nThe FBI did not point out any specifics websites to avoid. Cue threat hunter Will Thomas, who has posted some example URLs on X, and Malwarebytes, which has published “some recent examples of domains involved in this type of scam:\n\nImageconvertors[.]com (phishing)\n\nconvertitoremp3[.]it (Riskware)\n\nconvertisseurs-pdf[.]com (Riskware)\n\nconvertscloud[.]com (Phishing)\n\nconvertix-api[.]xyz (Trojan)\n\nconvertallfiles[.]com (Adware)\n\nfreejpgtopdfconverter[.]com (Riskware)\n\nprimeconvertapp[.]com (Riskware)\n\n9convert[.]com (Riskware)\n\nConvertpro[.]org (Riskware).”\n\nThis threat, per the FBI’s warning, bleeds into the ransomware attacks hitting organizations across the U.S., public and private, large and small.\n\nAs CBS News reports, “federal investigators suggest the file converter method of attack may be behind the February ransomware attack of a Davenport, Iowa-based media company. Lee Enterprises operates media outlets in more than 70 small-town markets throughout the country, according to its website.”\n\nIn reality, free document converters carry the same risk as the free apps that lure their way onto millions of phones, promising some sort of trivial functionality — QR code or document reader, for example, while in reality porting malware or abusing device permissions to harvest data and transmit this back to its handlers.\n\nAccording to Fred Chagnon from Info-Tech Research Group (via CSO Online), there are multiple risks with using document cionverters, beyond just phishing. “Firstly, and most prominently, you can’t trust the integrity of the file you’re getting back. Even the malicious services out there will perform the actual conversion for the user.”\n\nBeyond that, Chagnon warns, “the resulting PDF file may contain embedded JavaScript code, which executes upon launch, or in the case of a Word or Excel document, Visual Basic code, in the form of macros, could be hiding within the document. Endpoint detection and response tools can act as a layer of defense against these malicious programs, but this is not bulletproof.”\n\nThat same threat — documents hiding malware and phishing lures — is now surging, according to researchers at Cofense, with fake online tools driving the risk. The cyber team has just warned that dangerous “document websites” accounted for an alarming “8.8% of all credential phishing campaigns in 2024, showing the growing significance of this method.” This time the attacks pretend to be well-known document sharing websites rather than document conversion websites, masquerading as major brands.\n\n“A specific mechanism to evade detection,” Cofense says, “is using online documents, such as Adobe, DocuSign, Dropbox, Canva, and Zoho. These services are often used internally and externally by companies, making the domains a trusted source when it comes to Secure Email Gateways automation. Some of these services will even email the recipient of the document directly, allowing threat actors to put little effort into their campaigns.”\n\nCofense says these document websites “are all trusted domains, as they are commonly used both by the public and with internal documents at companies. Therefore, many SEGs automatically allow these links to enter user email inboxes.”\n\nIn these attacks, legitimate domains are used to make easy detection all but impossible once an email or link lands on a user’s device. Cofense says the websites most commonly used in attacks belong to “DocuSign, Google Documents, Adobe, Canva, Dropbox, and Zoho… domains used in campaigns, specifically docusign[.]net, docs[.]google[.]com and drive[.]google[.]com, adobe[.]com, sharepoint[.]com, canva[.]com, dropbox[.]com, and zoho[.]com, respectively.”\n\nForbesGoogle’s Play Store Upgrade—Do You Need A New Phone?\n\nThanks to the FBI’s warning, the document conversion threat is now getting more press coverage which will increase awareness. The document collaboration threat is on a very different scale, per the Cofense report, and it requires more sophisticated email and website defenses to be deployed. The use of on-device AI to monitor for such threats when they break through cloud or server-side defenses will be critical.\n\nAt least where document conversion is concerned, staying safe is relatively easy. Per Bleeping Computer, “while not all file converters are malware, it’s essential to research them before using and check reviews before downloading any programs. If a site is relatively unknown, it is better to avoid it altogether.”"

        "full_text": "A heavy vehicle that was carrying four U.S. Army soldiers remained submerged in a swamp in Lithuania on Thursday, two days after the soldiers were reported missing after they did not return from a training mission, the U.S. military said.\n\nThe vehicle was discovered on Wednesday after a search by the U.S. Army, the Lithuanian military and other Lithuanian authorities, the U.S. military said. The soldiers still had not been found on Thursday because the Army was struggling to extract the vehicle from the mud.\n\n“The challenges presented by the water, thick mud and soft ground around the site have complicated recovery efforts and have required specialized equipment to drain water from the side and stabilize the ground,” the Army said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nEngineers on the site were building berms — barriers made of dirt and sand — to create a contained area from which water could be pumped and mud dredged, allowing emergency workers to access the vehicle, the Army said.\n\n“Due to the terrain, this is an incredibly complex engineering effort,” Maj. Robin Bruce, a 1st Armored Division engineer, said in the Army statement. He added, “The team is exploring every available option to speed up this process.”\n\nThe soldiers, from the First Brigade, Third Infantry Division, were training near Pabrade, a city in eastern Lithuania near the border with Belarus, early Tuesday, the U.S. military said.\n\nThey had been sent out in an M88 Hercules, essentially a giant armored tow truck, to extract another Army vehicle, the military said. They may have driven off the road and into the swamp, according to a U.S. Army official in Europe. The soldiers appeared to have been trapped inside as the M88 sank, the official said.\n\n“This tragic situation weighs heavily on all of us, and we’re keeping the families, friends and teammates of our soldiers and recovery team in our thoughts and prayers,” Maj. Gen. Curtis Taylor, the commanding general of First Armored Division, said on Thursday.\n\nThe initial search for the soldiers, through thick forests and swampy terrain, involved hundreds of American and Lithuanian soldiers and law enforcement officers, Lithuanian military helicopters and dive teams, the Army said.\n\n“We are incredibly appreciative of the dedicated and professional efforts of our Lithuanian allies in ensuring the safety of U.S. personnel,” General Taylor said. “They have worked tirelessly alongside us over the last 48 hours and we continue to be grateful for their support.”\n\nLithuania’s defense minister, Dovile Sakaliene, met with American military commanders and said the country would provide whatever resources were necessary to help in the search. In a statement on social media, Ms. Sakaliene called the American soldiers “OUR soldiers and friends.”\n\nPresident Trump said on Wednesday that he had not been briefed on the situation and appeared to be unaware of the search for the soldiers."

        "full_text": "US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem arrived in El Salvador Wednesday to tour the notoriously hellish prison housing alleged gang members deported by the Trump administration — and she’s expected to ask the Central American country’s president to make more room.\n\nNoem, 53, arrived at the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT), where 250 suspected Tren de Aragua and MS-13 gang members were shipped from the US by President Trump earlier this month.\n\nThey joined 15,000 inmates already held at the infamous lockup — which is known for deliberately dehumanizing conditions intended to serve as the ultimate deterrent in El Salvador’s years-long battle against gang violence.\n\nThere she viewed rows of tattooed inmates standing obediently along the bars of their massive but crammed cells and got a glimpse of the arsenal of heavy weaponry — including assault rifles — the prison’s army of guards use to maintain order.\n\n“No one expects that these people can go back to society and behave,” said Gustavo Villatoro, El Salvador’s minister of justice and public security, as he led Noem on a tour through the sweltering prisoner barracks, according to a press pool report.\n\nSeveral of the inmates Noem was shown were the suspected gangbangers Trump shipped south, and like the rest of the prisoners, they stood silent in their uniforms of white T-shirts and shorts.\n\nTrue to her nickname — ICE Barbie — Noem put her flowing hair on display under her Immigration and Customs Enforcement baseball hat as she was led through the facility.\n\nAfter the tour, Noem will meet with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele and is expected to discuss increasing the number of US deportees bound for CECOT, Fox News reported.\n\nHer visit to El Salvador is the first stop in a three-day tour of Latin American countries to discuss organized crime that’s been spilling beyond their borders and pouring into the US. She is expected to travel to Colombia next and then Mexico, where she’ll meet with each nation’s president.\n\n“We are in several other countries around the world with a message right now that’s saying if you are thinking of coming to America illegally, don’t do it. You are not welcome,” she said on Monday.\n\nNoem’s tour flies in the face of efforts back home to block Trump’s deportations to CECOT, which he initiated after invoking 1798 Alien Enemies Act to drag the alleged gangbangers out of the country without a trial.\n\nThe wartime act dates back to an 18th-century naval conflict and allows the president to deport non-citizens without the due process typically required. It was last used in World War II to hold Japanese and German Americans in internment camps.\n\nSince Trump declared Tren de Aragua a terrorist organization in January, it allows him to use the Alien Enemies Act against them.\n\nBut within hours of the flights departing for CECOT, a federal judge blocked the order and placed a 14-day hold on its use.\n\nThe White House ignored that order, arguing that since the planes were already in the air and over international waters they had no bearing on the operation.\n\nAs Noem arrived in El Salvador, a federal appeals court upheld the block in a 2-1 vote.\n\n“Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act than has happened here,” Judge Patricia Millett said during a heated hearing.\n\nTrump has vowed to fight the block to get his way.\n\nThe deal to keep Tren de Aragua deportees at CECOT was struck in February between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Bukele. El Salvador is charging the US a “relatively low” fee for the usage, Rubio has said, though the number has not been disclosed.\n\nCECOT is located 47 miles south of capital city San Salvador and was opened in 2023 as Bukele launched a major offensive against organized crime in the country.\n\nInmates spend 23 and a half hours a day in cells that hold up to 70 people, where they eat, bathe and go to the bathroom.\n\nMeals consist of nothing more than beans and pasta, and they use one communal basin for drinking, and another for bathing. Their bunks – metal beds which pile four levels high – have no sheets, mattresses or pillows.\n\nPrisoners are only allowed out of their cells for 30 minutes of exercise, which is done indoors — inmates serving at CECOT are not allowed outdoors, and few will ever see the sun again.\n\nMost inmates are serving life sentences, and have been described by prison director Belarmino Garcia as “psychopaths who will be difficult to rehabilitate.”\n\nDuring Noem’s tour, she was shown one man serving 465 years for homicide and terrorism."

The conversation culminated in Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth sharing highly sensitive details about the Trump administration's war plans in Yemen, including the timeline, the weapons systems that would be deployed and precise attack sequencing.\n\nIn the days before Hegseth shared those details, officials had a lengthy back-and-forth about whether they should move forward with the military strike as planned or wait it out.\n\nIn addition to Waltz, Hegseth, and Vance, the Signal chat included Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and others.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend that Waltz has also used Signal to communicate about other sensitive topics, including Somalia and Russia's war against Ukraine.\n\nDemocratic Representative Sean Casten of Illinois wrote on X, formerly Twitter: \"In the wake of the massive incompetence coming out of [House] Speaker [Mike] Johnson's office today, don't lose sight of the fact that Mike Waltz is ALSO incompetent and continues to present a massive security liability to the United States.\"\n\nFormer Democratic Senator Al Franken, on X: \"Bad enough that Mike Waltz used Gmail for sensitive information.

Waltz should resign. Hegseth should resign.\"\n\nTrump has publicly backed Waltz and told reporters last week that he didn't know if classified information was shared on the Signal chat: \"I don't know. I'm not sure. You have to ask the various people involved.

        "full_text": "NBC News’ Steve Kornacki will not return to MSNBC after 12 years following the network’s spinoff arrangement.\n\nKornacki, the popular political data sensation, has agreed to remain with NBC News in his renewed contract and expand his appearances across the network’s news and sports divisions, The Los Angeles Times reported. The contract does not include his employment at MSNBC, which has turned into a new corporate entity by its parent company, Comcast.\n\nComcast announced plans to spinoff MSNBC, along with other networks, after the network’s ratings fell 53% following President Donald Trump’s defeat of former Vice President Kamala Harris in November 2024.\n\nThe new contract makes Kornacki an NBC contributor with the title of chief data analyst, according to the LA Times.\n\nKornacki’s departure from MSNBC marks another major shakeup for the network following former anchor Joy Reid’s firing in February. Reid, who was known for obsessing over race during her 7 p.m. program, had been replaced by co-hosts Michael Steele, Symone Sanders-Townsend and Alicia Menendez. (RELATED: Chuck Todd Announces Departure From NBC News)\n\nAt MSNBC, Kornacki made frequent appearances during the 2024 election where he broke down key polling numbers for the then-Republican nominee Donald Trump, former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris. He further played an important roll in election coverage in 2020, where he put in record-long hours in front of the touchscreen as results took days to finalize.\n\nThe popular data guru began his career as a political writer, earning him a contributor gig at CNN, according to The LA Times. He joined MSNBC in 2012 as a co-host on the program, “The Cycle,” and became a regular in the networks lineup.\n\nMSNBC did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.\n\nNow that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate media and joining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes to marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; senators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want to limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our independence.\n\nWe don't complain -- we can't stand complainers -- but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our hands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.\n\nWe're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates them -- because we won’t bend the knee to political correctness.\n\nOne reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of our being, and we think she's worth saving from today’s craziness.\n\nHelp us save her.\n\nA second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train. We have trained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political spectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There’s a good chance they were trained at Daily Caller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, Newsmax, Daily Wire and many others.\n\nSimply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a fair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.\n\nSince 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. And we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible to ignore.\n\nWe can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can’t do it unless you — the everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment — have our back.\n\nPlease consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, corporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new generation of news reporters who will actually tell the truth. And help us remind Americans everywhere that there are millions of us who remain clear-eyed about our country's greatness.\n\nIn return for membership, Daily Caller Patriots will be able to read The Daily Caller without any of the ads that we have long used to support our mission.

        "full_text": "A federal judge on Wednesday dismissed the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, although without the strings attached that had been sought by the Department of Justice.\n\nU.S. District Judge Dale Ho dismissed the case with prejudice, meaning the charges cannot be refiled at a later date. The DOJ's request for a dismissal without prejudice could have left the Democratic mayor beholden to President Donald Trump's administration, which considers Adams an ally in its immigration crackdown.\n\n\"Dismissing the case without prejudice would create the unavoidable perception that the Mayor's freedom depends on his ability to carry out the immigration enforcement priorities of the administration, and that he might be more beholden to the demands of the federal government than to the wishes of his own constituents,\" the judge wrote.\n\nNYC Mayor Eric Adams' case: Lawyer recommends dropping charges\n\nProsecutors had asked for the right to bring charges again\n\nThe decision comes weeks after a court-appointed attorney, Paul D. Clement, counseled Ho to dismiss the indictment with prejudice. Ho selected Clement, who was a solicitor general under President George W. Bush, to present arguments against the prosecutors' bid to dismiss the charges in part because Adams and the DOJ were aligned in their positions.\n\nFederal prosecutors filed a motion to dismiss the corruption charges against Adams in February, arguing that Adams can't effectively cooperate on immigration enforcement if he is fighting a corruption case. But prosecutors also asked for the right to bring the charges again.\n\nHo, however, wrote that the DOJ's assertion is \"unsubstantiated,\" noting that Adams took at least one new immigration-related action while the indictment was pending: allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement to operate at the Rikers Island Jail Complex, a decision Ho said \"appears to be contrary to New York City law.\"\n\n\"Everything here smacks of a bargain: dismissal of the Indictment in exchange for immigration policy concessions,\" Ho wrote.\n\nAdams pleaded not guilty in September\n\nAdams pleaded not guilty in September to charges of accepting free travel and political donations from Turkish officials to take actions that benefitted their country. He has maintained his innocence.\n\n“As I said from the outset, I never broke the law and I never will. I never put any personal benefit above my solemn responsibility as your mayor,\" Adams said in a video statement in mid-February. “I absolutely never traded my power as an elected official for personal benefit.”\n\nHo stressed that his decision not to deny the DOJ's motion altogether is not a reflection of Adams' guilt or innocence. The judge wrote that while the court cannot force the government to prosecute a defendant, it can \"shine a light on the reasons that DOJ has decided to dismiss this case, leaving the most important judgment to the public.\"\n\nAdams, now running for reelection, has been under pressure to resign since the indictment. But New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said she would not oust Adams from office and would instead seek to impose strict new guidelines on his administration."

(AP) — New York state prisons will release some inmates early because the system does not have enough corrections officers, weeks after the state fired more than 2,000 guards who went on strike over poor working conditions.\n\nIn a memo Monday, corrections Commissioner Daniel Martuscello directed prison leaders to begin identifying inmates who were convicted of minor crimes and already set for release within 15 to 110 days to be considered for an early discharge.\n\nInmates convicted of sex crimes, violent felonies or serious felonies such as murder, terrorism and arson would not be eligible for early release, the state corrections department said.\n\nMartuscello wrote that the early releases would occur ‘in view of the current staffing crisis, and in order to have the appropriate balance between the safety and well-being of those working and residing” in state prisons.\n\nThe move came after a widespread corrections officer strike that lasted for 22 days and crippled the operations of state’s prison system. The state eventually fired more than 2,000 guards who refused to return to work after the state and guards’ union reached a deal to end the work stoppage.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, signed an executive order that prevents state agencies from hiring guards who were fired for striking.\n\nA spokeswoman for Hochul said the governor supports Martuscello’s “efforts to safely address staffing shortages and personnel concerns” in a statement Tuesday."

        "full_text": "Curtis Means | Via Reuters\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi on Tuesday said she had ordered federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty against Luigi Mangione, who is charged with murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York City in December.\n\n\"Luigi Mangione's murder of Brian Thompson — an innocent man and father of two young children — was a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America,\" Bondi said in a statement issued by the Department of Justice.\n\n\"After careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump's agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again,\" the attorney general said.\n\nKaren Agnifilo, Mangione's lawyer, condemned Bondi's decision.\n\n\"By seeking to murder Luigi Mangione, the Justice Department has moved from the dysfunctional to the barbaric,\" Agnifilo said in a statement.\n\n\"Their decision to execute Luigi is political and goes against the recommendation of the local federal prosecutors, the law, and historical precedent,\" the attorney said.\n\n\"While claiming to protect against murder, the federal government moves to commit the pre-meditated, state-sponsored murder of Luigi,\" Agnifilo said.\n\n\"By doing this, they are defending the broken, immoral, and murderous healthcare industry that continues to terrorize the American people.\"\n\nBondi's decision came more than two months after President Donald Trump, on his first day in office, signed an executive order calling for the restoration of use of the federal death penalty. That order directed the attorney general to \"pursue the death penalty for all crimes of a severity demanding its use.\"\n\nThe DOJ under the Biden administration imposed a moratorium on federal executions in mid-2021.\n\nIn February, U.S. District Judge Katherine Parker appointed an attorney who is a death-penalty expert to Mangione's legal team at the request of the Federal Defenders of New York, an independent organization that represents indigent defendants.\n\nMangione, 26, is being prosecuted in U.S. District Court in Manhattan with federal crimes, including murder, stalking, and firearms charges, related to Thompson's killing outside the Hilton Hotel in midtown Manhattan on Dec. 4.\n\nThompson, whose company is the largest payer of health insurance benefits in the United States, was headed into the hotel for an investor meeting of its parent, UnitedHealth Group .\n\nMangione was apprehended five days later at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where police found him in possession of a pistol, a silencer, ammunition, fake IDs and a U.S. passport.\n\nCourtesy: UnitedHealth Group\n\nMangione, who is being held without bail, has not yet entered a plea in federal cases.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty to murder and other charges in Manhattan Supreme Court, which is a trial-level New York state court. He faces a maximum possible sentence of life without parole in that case if convicted. New York state does not have the death penalty.\n\nThe DOJ, in its statement Tuesday, said that Thompson's \"murder was an act of political violence.\"\n\n\"Mangione's actions involved substantial planning and premeditation and because the murder took place in public with bystanders nearby, may have posed grave risk of death to additional persons,\" the statement said.\n\nThe department previously said that the University of Pennsylvania graduate planned to kill Thompson to spark public discussion about the health care industry.\n\nAgnifilo, in her statement, said, \"We are prepared to fight these federal charges, brought by a lawless Justice Department, as well as the New York State charges, and the Pennsylvania charges, and anything else they want to pile on Luigi.\"\n\n\"This is a corrupt web of government dysfunction and one-upmanship. Luigi is caught in a high-stakes game of tug-of-war between state and federal prosecutors, except the trophy is a young man's life,\" Agnifilo said.\n\nThirteen of the 16 people executed by the federal government since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988 were executed over the final seven months of Trump's first term in office, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.\n\nThe other three executions were carried out in 2001 and 2003, during President George W. Bush's first term.\n\nThen-Attorney General Merrick Garland in July 2021 imposed a moratorium on federal executions pending a review of DOJ policies and procedures, including \"the risk of pain and suffering associated with the use of pentobarbital,\" a drug used in lethal injection executions.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden on Dec. 23 commuted the death sentences of all but three of the 40 people in federal death row."

        "full_text": "In mid-March, President Donald Trump invoked an almost-never-used federal law, claiming that it gives him the power to deport many immigrants at will with minimal or no legal process to determine if these deportations are lawful. The text of that statute, the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, does not give presidents the power Trump claims.\n\nFor the moment, at least, a lower court order blocks Trump’s Alien Enemies Act proclamation; that order is still in effect, although there is ongoing litigation about whether the Trump administration defied it by sending dozens of Venezuelan immigrants to a prison in El Salvador after the lower court ordered the planes carrying these immigrants to be turned around.\n\nSCOTUS, Explained\n\nGet the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.\n\nEmail (required)\n\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice. This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nNow Trump wants the Supreme Court to halt the lower court order and effectively allow him to resume deportations without any meaningful review, and without having to prove the immigrants targeted by his proclamation have actually done anything wrong. The case, which is known as Trump v. J.G.G., is before the Court on its “shadow docket,” a mix of emergency motions and other matters which the justices often decide after only cursory review of the case. A decision on the case could come any time in the next few weeks.\n\nIn J.G.G., Trump’s lawyers make three arguments that, when combined, would give him virtually unchecked authority to remove any noncitizen from the United States.\n\nFirst, Trump claims the unprecedented authority to invoke the Alien Enemies Act during peacetime, and against a nonstate actor — in this case, Tren de Aragua, a criminal gang that originated in Venezuela. That law, which does give the president sweeping authority to remove foreign nationals when properly invoked, only applies during a “declared war between the United States and any foreign nation or government,” or during a military “invasion or predatory incursion” of the United States.\n\nCongress — the only branch of government that can declare war — has not declared war on Venezuela, and the alleged presence of civilian criminals in the United States is not a military operation. Also, the Alien Enemies Act only applies to military actions by a “foreign nation or government.” Tren de Aragua is not its own nation, nor does it control the government of Venezuela.\n\nSecond, Trump’s lawyers argue that the immigrants challenging his proclamation may only bring their case in Texas federal court, under a legal procedure known as a “habeas” proceeding, which typically can only be used by a single individual to challenge their own detention.\n\nThat matters for two reasons. Federal cases brought in Texas appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, a far-right court that routinely interprets the law in creative ways to benefit right-wing causes and the Republican Party, something likely to put anyone trying to stop a deportation at a disadvantage. Additionally, if challenges can only be brought on an individual basis, it may no longer be possible to obtain a broad court order blocking his entire proclamation.\n\nThird, even if an immigrant targeted by Trump could convince the Fifth Circuit to shield them from deportation, they are unlikely to ever get that chance. As Judge Patricia Millett, one of four lower court judges who’s already heard the J.G.G. case, explains, the administration’s position is that once Trump’s proclamation goes into effect “it can immediately resume removal flights without affording Plaintiffs notice of the grounds for their removal or any opportunity to call a lawyer, let alone to file a writ of habeas corpus or obtain any review of their legal challenges to removal.”\n\nIf the Court were to accept this third argument, Trump would be able to deport people so quickly that, by the time a lawyer or judge learns they were deported, it will be too late to do anything about it.\n\nTrump’s peacetime invocation of the Alien Enemies Act is illegal\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act has only been invoked three times in American history: during the War of 1812 and during both world wars. In all three instances, Congress had formally declared war.\n\nIt’s likely that presidents have been reluctant to use this power in the past, even during other wars, because the authority provided by the Alien Enemies Act is extraordinarily draconian. When properly invoked, the law permits the federal government to arrest, detain, and remove “all natives, citizens, denizens, or subjects of the hostile nation or government, being of the age of fourteen years and upward, who shall be within the United States and not actually naturalized.” So during a declared war with Germany, the president may order nearly all German citizens removed from the United States, regardless of whether those German nationals took any aggressive or criminal action whatsoever.\n\nTrump now claims that he can use this law during peacetime to target alleged members of Tren de Aragua.\n\nEven setting aside the fact that the Alien Enemies Act only applies to foreign nations or governments — and Tren de Aragua is neither — there appears to be no legal authority whatsoever supporting Trump’s claim that this law can be used against a foreign gang engaged in ordinary criminal activity.\n\nIn its brief to the justices, the Trump administration claims that Tren de Aragua’s alleged presence in the United States constitutes a “predatory incursion” under the Alien Enemies Act. But the only source Trump’s lawyers cite to support this claim is a 1945 trial court decision that quotes President John Tyler (who became president in 1841) using the term “predatory incursion” to refer to military raids during a war between Mexico and the then-Republic of Texas.\n\nSo this 1945 opinion offers no support for the proportion that a “predatory incursion” can be committed by civilians during peacetime. And, in any event, it’s notable that the only legal source Trump’s lawyers could come up with is an 80-year-old decision by a single, low-ranking judge.\n\nThe J.G.G. plaintiffs’ brief, by contrast, quotes from numerous founding era dictionaries and other historical documents that use this term exclusively to refer to a military raid, including a letter from George Washington to Thomas Jefferson, which used “predatory incursion” to refer to a British raid on American military supplies in Virginia.\n\nTrump’s proclamation, in other words, relies on a wholly novel interpretation of the Alien Enemies Act, one that posits it can be used in peacetime, despite what the text of the law says. And his lawyers did not find any support whatsoever for this new interpretation in over 200 years of American legal history.\n\nTrump’s attempts to cut off judicial review are also meritless\n\nPerhaps recognizing that its interpretation of the Alien Enemies Act is unprecedented, the Trump administration spends the bulk of its J.G.G. brief raising procedural objections to the lower court’s order blocking Trump’s proclamation, particularly its claim that this proclamation can only be challenged in habeas proceedings in Texas.\n\nHabeas proceedings typically must be brought in the jurisdiction where the prisoner is held. The Trump administration incarcerated the J.G.G. plaintiffs in Texas, so it claims that their suits must be brought in Texas federal court.\n\nHowever, habeas proceedings are a way — often the only way — for someone in federal prison to challenge their detention. And the plaintiffs in J.G.G. do not challenge the government’s ability to detain them while a valid removal case against them proceeds. They simply challenge the Trump administration’s attempt to remove them without due process under the Alien Enemies Act. And the Supreme Court has held that habeas is not the right remedy when a plaintiff does not challenge their detention.\n\nAs the Court said in Skinner v. Switzer (2011), there is no case “in which the Court has recognized habeas as the sole remedy, or even an available one, where the relief sought would ‘neither terminat[e] custody, accelerat[e] the future date of release from custody, nor reduc[e] the level of custody.’”\n\nThat decision means Trump’s attempt to shunt any challenge to his proclamation into individual legal proceedings, where the individuals bringing those proceedings can be deported before they can even speak to their lawyers, should have no merit. If one of the J.G.G. plaintiffs also want to challenge their detention, that case may need to be brought in Texas, but the Trump administration’s attempt to shut down a broader challenge to the Alien Enemies Act proclamation cannot be squared with Supreme Court precedent.\n\nAdditionally, a different federal immigration law cuts against Trump’s claim that immigrants challenging the Alien Enemies Act proclamation must be brought in individual habeas suits. The Immigration and Nationality Act generally provides that it lays out “the sole and exclusive procedure for determining whether an alien may be … removed from the United States.”\n\nThis law, moreover, gives immigrants a variety of procedural rights, such as the right to claim asylum. It does permit expedited proceedings against some immigrants, including those that commit serious felonies, but even those noncitizens are entitled to notice and a hearing before they are removed from the country. And this law undercuts the administration’s argument that it can summarily deport people.\n\nOf course, any legal analysis of any Supreme Court case involving Trump must come with a caveat. This is the same Court that ruled over the summer that Trump can use the powers of the presidency to commit crimes, so there is no guarantee that these justices will follow existing law.\n\nNevertheless, the law — as it is understood now — is quite clear that Trump cannot use the Alien Enemies Act to cut off due process for immigrants during peacetime."

So what might we learn on Wednesday?\n\nHow big are the tariffs?\n\nThe White House has not said how high the tariffs could go, although various possible rates have been floated by analysts.\n\nOn the campaign trail last year, Trump backed a 10% across-the-board tariff on all imports coming into the US, sometimes suggesting that could be 20% - even 60% on imports from China.\n\nOnce in office, he introduced the idea of \"reciprocal\" tariffs, suggesting the rates could vary country by country.\n\n\"Very simply, it's if they charge us, we charge them,\" he said in February, shortly before he ordered officials to develop such a plan.\n\nThe White House almost immediately complicated the picture, noting that their recommendations would reflect not just tariffs but also other policies they believe are unfair to US businesses, like Value Added Tax (VAT).\n\nIt has a led to a scramble, as businesses and political leaders try to get a sense of how big a new tax their products might be facing; and how whatever is announced on Wednesday will interact with other duties, such as those on steel and aluminium, already put into effect by Trump.\n\nOfficials in Europe, for example, are preparing for a double-digit tariff on their exports. Trump earlier this year said he planned to hit goods from the bloc with a 25% import tax.\n\nWhich countries could be affected?\n\nThe Trump administration has not confirmed which countries will be hit, although it has trailed Wednesday's announcement as a sweeping one.\n\nOn Sunday, the president said the new tariffs could apply to \"all countries\", suggesting a possible return to the across-the-board tariff he backed in the campaign.\n\nIt dashed hopes in some countries, such as the UK, that thought they might float under the radar, though many are still hoping eventually to work out some sort of deal.\n\nBut it is still unclear to what extent the tariffs will be universally applied or more targeted.\n\nLast month, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said efforts were focused on the \"Dirty 15\" - the 15% of countries that account for the bulk of trade with the US and impose tariffs or other rules that put US firms at a disadvantage.\n\nThe Office of the US Trade Representative, as it prepared to craft recommendations, identified the countries in which it was \"particularly interested\".\n\nThey were Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the UK and Vietnam.\n\nTrump himself has reserved some of his harshest criticism for historic allies and major trade partners, such as Canada and the EU.\n\n\"Friend has been, oftentimes, much worse than foe,\" he declared last week.\n\nWhat impact will the tariffs have?\n\nTariffs are taxes on imports. So the big question is, who will pay?\n\nTechnically, there is a simple answer: the US firms bringing in the goods are the companies that will face the bill, especially if the White House starts levying the tariffs \"immediately\", as spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt suggested on Tuesday.\n\nBut the larger the tariffs are, the more firms will be looking for ways to offset those costs, either by changing suppliers, pushing business partners to share the burden - or by raising prices for Americans.\n\nMany firms have said they are already preparing for that step. But it is a risky game because if companies raise prices too much, buyers will simply stay away.\n\nThe dynamics have raised the risks of an economic recession both in the US - and far outside its borders, where many firms rely on US sales.\n\nTrump says companies looking to avoid tariffs can simply do their business in the US, but that's not an immediate, or easy fix, given the high costs of hiring and setting up factories.\n\nIntroduce currency swings and retaliation by other countries into the mix, and the repercussions of Trump's bid to reset global trade balances are likely to prove hard to predict long after Wednesday's announcement."

        "full_text": "In its first abortion-related case since Donald Trump retook control of the White House, the US supreme court on Wednesday heard oral arguments in a case challenging South Carolina’s attempt to effectively “defund” Planned Parenthood because the reproductive health giant performs abortions.\n\nThe case, Medina v Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, deals with a 2018 executive order from the South Carolina governor Henry McMaster that blocked clinics that provide abortions from receiving reimbursements via Medicaid, the US government’s healthcare program for low-income people, despite the fact that those reimbursements don’t actually cover abortions. “Payment of taxpayer funds to abortion clinics, for any purpose, results in the subsidy of abortion and the denial of the right to life,” McMaster said at the time.\n\nHowever, federal law bans Medicaid from covering the vast majority of abortions, which only comprised about 4% of Planned Parenthood’s activities in fiscal year 2022. Instead, people use Medicaid to cover Planned Parenthood’s other services. In the same year, the organization performed nearly half a million Pap tests and breast exams as well as 4.6m STI tests and treatments. It also provided birth control services to more than 2.2 million people.\n\nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic, a Planned Parenthood affiliate that operates two clinics in South Carolina, teamed up with a patient who sought birth control, Julie Edwards, to sue over McMaster’s order. Lower courts have since kept the order from going into effect.\n\nThe supreme court is currently controlled 6-3 by conservatives. If the court sides with South Carolina, it could pave the way for other states to exclude Planned Parenthood from their Medicaid programs as well as devastate South Carolinians’ ability to access reproductive healthcare and family planning services.\n\nOf the 2.4 million people treated at Planned Parenthood nationwide each year, nearly half are on Medicaid. About four in 10 women who have sought care at family-planning clinics say those clinics are their only recent source of healthcare.\n\nAt the heart of the case is a federal provision that guarantees that people insured by Medicaid can freely choose their own providers as long as they accept the program and are qualified to provide care. The case hinges on a technical argument: South Carolina – which is being represented by the powerhouse Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom – says Medicaid beneficiaries have no right to sue if they believe that guarantee has been violated.\n\nOral arguments zeroed in on this technicality, as ADF senior counsel John Bursch argued that the guarantee lacks “clear rights-creating language”.\n\n“It does not use the word ‘right’ or its functional equivalent,” Bursch said. “Nor does it use word with a deeply rooted, rights-creating pedigree, like the fifth amendment’s ‘no person shall’.”\n\nThe three liberal justices on the supreme court – Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson – appeared ready to reject that argument. It’s impossible to describe Medicaid’s guarantee, Kagan said, without calling it a “right”.\n\n“The obligation is to ensure that individuals can choose their doctor,” Kagan said. “There’s a correlative right. There’s an obligation, there’s a right. And the right is the right to choose their doctor.”\n\nThe conservative wing of the court seemed more split. Justice Amy Coney Barrett appeared particularly worried about leaving patients unable to seek help if their preferred qualified provider was kicked out of Medicaid. “If I want to go see Dr Jones and that’s the provider of my choice and the state has disqualified Dr Jones … there’s no mechanism, am I right, for the beneficiary to say: ‘Well you’re depriving me of my ability’ – we won’t call it right, we won’t use the loaded word – ‘but the ability to see the provider of my choice’?” she asked.\n\nDuring arguments, Bursch suggested that, rather than suing, patients could ask the government to intervene administratively.\n\nUltimately, these seemingly narrow arguments, legal experts warn, conceal the broader consequences of the case. If people can’t sue when they believe a state is violating Medicaid, then it will become far more difficult to keep states from discriminating against certain kinds of care, said Nicole Huberfeld, a health law professor at Boston University’s School of Public Health.\n\n“Even though the state is trying to claim that it has sole authority to decide who’s a qualified provider, this isn’t really about whether Planned Parenthood is a qualified provider. It’s about a political calculation on abortion,” Huberfeld said. “Really, what’s happening here is states making politically driven decisions about access to medical care.”\n\nA decision in the case is expected in June.\n\n“A medical home”\n\nMore than 1 million people in South Carolina use Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (Chip) – which is closely linked to Medicaid – for their insurance. Almost 40% of South Carolina counties are believed to be “contraceptive deserts”, where there are not enough providers to meet the needs of the people who live there. South Carolina bans abortion past six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nBecause Texas terminated Planned Parenthood from its state Medicaid program in 2021, it offers a window into what happens when people lose access to Planned Parenthood. The termination affected the healthcare of some 8,000 Texans.\n\n“Planned Parenthood, we heard again and again, was a medical home for people with very few options for providers,” said Anna Chatillon, a research scientist at Resound Research for Reproductive Health, who led a study that interviewed Texans about how the termination affected their lives. “In several different interviews, we heard people talking about showing up for an appointment, finding out that they couldn’t use Medicaid any longer, not having any idea where else to go, and experiencing real disruptions to their care based on that very quickly, but also serious emotional ramifications.”\n\nThe case is part of a broader, longstanding anti-abortion campaign against Planned Parenthood, which includes anongoing lawsuit that could bankrupt the organization over allegations that it defrauded Medicaid."

        "full_text": "Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino.\n\nMisinformation is nothing new. It has, however, become ubiquitous and, in some cases, more difficult and time-consuming than ever to debunk.\n\nWhen we first started publishing in 2003 — which predated Facebook (2004), YouTube (2005) and Twitter (2006) — viral misinformation took the form of chain emails. Although they were a problem at the time, chain emails were to misinformation what the Pony Express is to ChatGPT.\n\nAs the popularity of social media platforms has grown, so too has the scope of viral misinformation and the speed with which it travels. And this falsehood-fraught environment is increasingly where people get their news.\n\nIn a survey of U.S. adults last year, the Pew Research Center found that “just over half of U.S. adults (54%) say they at least sometimes get news from social media.”\n\nThe incredible growth of podcasts also has helped spread misinformation on social media. According to the Pew Research Center, 42% of Americans 12 and older said they had listened to a podcast in the past month in 2023 — up from only 9% in 2008. In February, YouTube — the largest video platform — announced that it had more than 1 billion monthly podcast users.\n\nThe emergence of artificial intelligence, or AI, makes it even more difficult for social media users to separate fact from fiction.\n\n“AI technologies, with their capability to generate convincing fake texts, images, audio and videos (often referred to as ‘deepfakes’), present significant difficulties in distinguishing authentic content from synthetic creations,” Cathy Li and Agustina Callegari of the World Economic Forum wrote last year in an article on how to combat AI misinformation.\n\nOur work aims to inform the public and debunk political falsehoods. But we can’t fact-check everything. Here’s our advice on how to identify bogus posts and factual distortions.\n\nThink before sharing. We have long advised our readers, “Be skeptical, not cynical.” When it comes to online content, that means: Think twice before you share that social media post.\n\n“Don’t hit reshare until you stop and think to yourself, ‘Am I reasonably sure that this is accurate … does this seem plausible?’” David Rand, a professor of brain and cognitive sciences at MIT, told PBS Newshour last year.\n\nWe know that this can be hard to do, particularly if the content evokes a powerful response in you and aligns with your beliefs — which is often the case. There’s two reasons for that:\n\nSeeking clicks, content providers give us text, images and videos that often provoke a reaction from us.\n\nUsing algorithms, social media platforms feed us what they think we want to see and hear.\n\nAs a result, social media posts often play to our emotions, and, as humans, we are susceptible to confirmation bias — which is the tendency to give too much weight to information that confirms our beliefs. The combination of the two makes misinformation go viral.\n\nBut resist the urge to immediately reshare.\n\nConsider the source. Who shared the claim? What do you know about this person or organization? Do they have any partisan or financial conflicts? What qualifies them to write or speak about the subject?\n\nWe’ve seen a lot of misinformation from people who draw conclusions and share opinions, despite a lack of expertise in the subject or a clear conflict of interest, or both.\n\nAt the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, we debunked bogus claims about the virus from several chiropractors. A multiple offender, chiropractor Eric Nepute, was sued by the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission for violating the COVID-19 Consumer Protection Act. In a settlement, Nepute agreed to pay a fine and stop making false claims about supplements that he advertised and sold as preventatives and treatments for COVID-19. The civil complaint said Nepute and his companies “have earned a substantial amount of money from selling these and other Wellness Warrior Products.”\n\nIf someone is making claims in an effort to sell you something, that’s a red flag to be skeptical.\n\nOf course, we also see a lot of misinformation from partisans — so be wary of liberal and conservative social media accounts making claims about the other side.\n\nFor example, we recently debunked the misleading claim spread by President Donald Trump and conservative commentators that Politico, an online news outlet, was being “completely” or “massively funded” by the U.S. Agency for International Development under the Biden administration. In fact, the media payments were for subscriptions that were common at many federal agencies under the Trump and Biden administrations.\n\nEvaluate the evidence. Does the person making the claim provide any evidence, such as links to articles, published research or other sources? Are some sources mentioned, but no links provided? How credible is the evidence provided?\n\nIt’s a red flag if no sources are provided. If sources are cited, find the source material and see if the evidence supports the claim. You would be surprised how often the “evidence” doesn’t support the claim. (Be careful in clicking on links. Make sure they lead to a legitimate website.)\n\nLast month, we did a story on social media posts that falsely claimed Trump ordered former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s release from the International Criminal Court. The posts cited “Executive Order 2025-03” — which doesn’t exist. That’s not even the numbering system for executive orders.\n\nYou should also check the credibility of the source material provided in the social media post.\n\nWe recently debunked misleading claims about measles in a video posted to X by Mary Holland, the CEO of the anti-vaccine advocacy group Children’s Health Defense that was founded by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Holland based her claims on an article written by Sayer Ji, the founder of an alternative medicine website who was named in the Center for Countering Digital Hate’s “Disinformation Dozen,” a list of top spreaders of vaccine misinformation on social media. Ji has a bachelor’s degree in philosophy from Rutgers University.\n\nJi’s history of spreading misinformation and his lack of expertise in the area of infectious diseases are red flags.\n\nIn another case, we wrote about an article in a peer-reviewed journal that made numerous false claims about COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. The article — which was later retracted — was written by known vaccination opponents who have spread misinformation about the mRNA vaccines, and it was published in a journal that did not have the same standards as more reputable journals.\n\nIf the social media post includes an image that you suspect might be a fake, then you can use reverse image search engines, such as Google and TinEye, that may help you find the original image and where and when it appeared online. We have used such tools numerous times over the years.\n\nEvidence or opinion? Cable TV commentators, podcasters and columnists have blurred the line between news and opinion.\n\nIf the evidence cited in the social media post comes from a news source — or purports to come from a news source, sometimes falsely labeled “breaking news” — you should consider if the social media post is sharing fact-based reporting or someone’s opinion of the news.\n\nEveryone is entitled to their own opinions, but we’ve found that many partisan websites, podcasters and commentators – whether they are pushing a liberal or conservative agenda — aren’t telling the full story. Their version of the facts is often slanted to benefit their side.\n\nConsult the experts. If you are still uncertain about the veracity of a social media claim, then you should consult the experts. That includes FactCheck.org — we’re on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Threads, X, BlueSky, WhatsApp and TikTok.\n\nA good place to start is Google or the search engines of FactCheck.org and other fact-checking websites.\n\nThe search should include keywords or a short excerpt of the social media post, podcast or video. For example, social media posts claimed the Department of Government Efficiency stopped “royalties” to former President Barack Obama for “Obamacare,” formally known as the Affordable Care Act. The top two results of a recent Google search of “royalties + Obama + Affordable Care Act” turned up articles by FactCheck.org and AFP Fact Check, a France-based fact-checking organization.\n\nGoogle has also created a tool called “Fact Check Explorer” — a searchable database of fact-checking articles from around the world. The same search for “royalties + Obama + Affordable Care Act” on Google’s Fact Check Explorer turned up six fact-checking articles – all debunking the claim about Obama.\n\nFact-checking articles take time to produce, so in some cases you may not immediately find a fact-checking article on the topic. You may, however, find some news articles on the subject — but make sure you are using trusted sources, such as the Wall Street Journal, Reuters, the Associated Press, New York Times and other established news outlets.\n\nWe know that trust in the media is low, but the fact is that legitimate news organizations, such as the Washington Post and New York Times, have written policies and procedures for such things as newsgathering, editing and corrections, as well as standards for ethical conduct and conflicts of interest.\n\nEven when using such trusted sources, you might want to check more than one source to see what others are reporting. Multiple news outlets will report on breaking news and major news developments, so be wary if only one news organization is reporting on the “news” that you are seeing on social media.\n\nAI-Generated Images\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, online content may be created by generative AI, which “can create original content — such as text, images, video, audio or software code — in response to a user’s prompt or request,” as IBM explains on its website.\n\nWe’ve already covered text in the section above. The same rules apply to text created by humans or AI services. Here we focus on AI-generated images, videos and audio.\n\nWe have been writing about fake photos for years. In the early years, the fakes were real images that were altered using Photoshop or other editing programs.\n\nIn 2008, for example, we wrote about an image that purportedly showed then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin wearing a red, white and blue bikini and holding a rifle. But it wasn’t her. Her head had been Photoshopped onto the body of another woman.\n\nUsing AI, people looking to entertain or cause mischief can create entirely new images, video and audio. Experts say you may be able to spot a fake by looking closely for red flags.\n\n“It is possible to create realistic appearing images, audio, and video with today’s generative AI tools,” Matthew Groh, an assistant professor of management and organizations at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, told us in an email. “One of the best ways to spot a lie (and likewise AI-generated media) is to search for contradictions.”\n\nGroh and his colleagues published a research paper in February that measured the accuracy of more than 50,000 participants who were asked to identify whether images were real or AI-generated. The participants were given “unlimited time, 20 seconds, 10 seconds, 5 seconds, and 1 second.” The paper found that “longer viewing times” improved the participants’ accuracy.\n\nUnnatural body parts. Groh and his Northwestern colleagues identified telltale signs of AI-generated photos for an article last year in Kellogg Insight, a school publication. They advised social media users to look closely at various body parts for “anatomical implausibilities.”\n\n“Are there missing or extra limbs or digits? Bodies that merge into their surroundings or into other nearby bodies? A giraffe-like neck on a human? In AI-generated images, teeth can overlap or appear asymmetrical. Eyes may be overly shiny, blurry, or hollow-looking,” the article said.\n\nIf the person is a public figure, you can compare facial features with existing news photos to spot discrepancies, the article also noted.\n\nOdd objects. There may also be oddities in the way that body parts interact with objects, or even problems with the objects themselves.\n\nFor example, the Kellogg Insight article included an AI-generated image that showed a person’s hand inside a hamburger. The hamburger itself is improbably large.\n\n“When there’s interactions between people and objects, there are often things that don’t look quite right,” Groh told Kellogg Insight, referring to these oddities as “functional implausibilities.”\n\nIrregular shadows and reflections. AI also has difficulty with shadows and reflections. Shadows may be cast in different directions, and reflections may not match the object they pretend to reflect, Groh and his colleagues said.\n\nFor example, an AI-generated image in the Kellogg Insight article shows a person wearing a short-sleeved shirt, while his mirror image is wearing a long-sleeved shirt. The Northwestern research paper describes these irregularities as “violations of physics.”\n\nThe researchers also identified two other telltale signs of AI-generated images: “stylistic artifacts,” which refer to “overly glossy, waxy, or picturesque qualities of specific elements of an image,” and “sociocultural implausibilities,” which are “scenarios that violate social norms, cultural context, or historical accuracy.”\n\nNonsensical words. Jonathan Jarry, a science communicator with McGill University’s Office for Science and Society, explained in an article on the university’s website last year that AI-generated images have trouble with words. In his article, Jarry asked an AI service to create a photo of Montreal circa 1931. One problem, however, was that the lettering displayed on background signage was “gibberish.”\n\n(Think you can tell real photos from bogus AI-generated images? Take the “Detect Fakes” test on Kellogg School’s website.)\n\nAI-Generated Video and Audio\n\nUnlike fake images, bogus video and audio are fairly new phenomena.\n\nWe recently wrote about an audio clip circulating on social media that purported to show Donald Trump Jr. saying “the U.S. should have been sending weapons to Russia,” instead of Ukraine. But we found no evidence that Trump ever made such a comment, and a digital forensic expert told us it was likely fake.\n\nLook for contextual clues. Determine if the text of the post or the audio or video clip itself offers some contextual clues — such as where and when the words were allegedly spoken.\n\nIn the case of the fake Trump audio, one red flag was the claim that the president’s son made his remark about Russia on a Feb. 25 episode of his podcast, “Triggered with Donald Trump Jr.” However, Trump did not make any such comment about Russia during that episode.\n\nListen for audio anomalies. The European Digital Media Observatory, a project of the European Commission, offers tips for detecting AI-generated audio and video. When listening to audio, it says to “[p]ay attention to choices of words, intonation, breaths, unnatural pauses and other elements that can manifest anomalies.”\n\nWatch for quality of video. The EDMO suggests checking “the quality of the video” to spot “out of focus contours, unrealistic features” and poor “synchronization of audio and video,” i.e., when the lips don’t match the audio.\n\nLook for disclaimers. Some social media platforms — including Meta, YouTube and TikTok — require users to add a label on AI-generated content. Check to see if the platform you are using has such a policy and, if so, look for the disclaimers.\n\nFor example, Meta, which owns Facebook, Threads and Instagram, uses an “AI info” label “for content we detect was generated by an AI tool and share whether the content is labeled because of industry-shared signals or because someone self-disclosed.”\n\nGroh, the Northwestern assistant professor, said that Community Notes on X — the platform formerly known as Twitter — can be useful at flagging AI-generated content.\n\n“Community notes can be very useful for adding context and directing people’s attention to possible tells,” such as this note in response to an image posted following Hurricane Milton, Groh said. “Likewise, context and insights from trusted sources like fact checkers or digital forensics experts can be useful for helping people on social media make up their minds about whether what they’ve seen online is AI-generated or real.”"

        "full_text": "Democrats scored a critical win Tuesday in their first major test at the ballot box since President Trump took office in January.\n\nThe elections came amid growing anger over the Trump’s administration’s immigration and economic policies, its handling of free speech, and the federal cuts made under Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nThe night served in part as a referendum on Musk, who has played an outsized role in the administration and poured millions of dollars into the Wisconsin race.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats sought to make inroads in the president’s home state of Florida, where two special House elections emerged as last-minute sleeper races that had some Republicans on edge.\n\nWhile Republicans were able to hold on to the Florida seats, Democrats ultimately had cause for celebration in the Sunshine State.\n\nHere are five takeaways from Tuesday night’s elections.\n\nA bitter night for Trump and Musk in Wisconsin\n\nTrump and Musk had a tough night in Wisconsin, a battleground state the president won by less than a percentage point in November, pointing to possible trouble ahead for the administration as it looks toward the midterms.\n\nBoth men endorsed Brad Schimel, a former GOP state attorney general, though it was Musk who became deeply invested in the race in the weeks leading up to the election. His America PAC spent $12.5 million alone in the race, and Musk himself traveled to the Badger State the Sunday before the election.\n\nDemocrats, who supported liberal candidate Susan Crawford, sought to harness anger toward Musk as a way to gin up their base — efforts that ultimately proved successful, as Crawford won decisively.\n\nThe election offers a warning sign for Republicans that Musk could be politically toxic in other key elections. Democratic candidates running in elections later this November and next year have already started to hammer Musk in their messaging.\n\nBut the results are also an embarrassment for Trump, who publicly urged Republican voters to back Schimel.\n\nUltimately, the Wisconsin race was the biggest rebuke yet faced by Republicans at the ballot box since Trump took office.\n\nThe president is sure to take notice as his party braces for an uphill climb in its effort to retain its House majority next year.\n\nDemocrats’ energy was through the roof\n\nDemocratic energy was on full display in both Wisconsin and Florida.\n\nIn Wisconsin, with more than 95 percent of the votes counted in the counties of Kenosha, Racine and Outagamie, Crawford was winning Kenosha with roughly 53 percent as of 11 p.m. EDT Tuesday — roughly the same amount Trump won the county with in 2024.\n\nAnd while votes are still being tallied, Crawford also appeared to have a good shot at flipping Racine and Outagamie, counties Trump also won last year.\n\nCrawford also overperformed in counties former Vice President Kamala Harris won in November, including in Door County where Crawford was winning the county with 56 percent, compared to Harris’s 51 percent.\n\nWhile Democrats lost both special elections in Florida, the party clearly overperformed, narrowing the margins considerably in deep-red districts.\n\nThe results heartened Democrats, who have struggled to coalesce around a unified message since Trump took office.\n\nIf Tuesday proved anything, it’s that the party is still willing to organize and turn out in large numbers even if there’s frustration with the Democratic leadership.\n\nFlorida is still Trump Country\n\nEven as Democrats overperformed considerably in Florida’s 1st and 6th congressional districts, they failed to win — underscoring the GOP’s grip on the state.\n\nBy midafternoon Tuesday, data from Decision Desk HQ showed Republicans were dominating Election Day turnout.\n\nRepublicans enjoy a roughly 1.2 million voter registration advantage in the state, making turnout during an off-year special election their biggest obstacle. GOP candidate Randy Fine, in particular, faced criticism from Republicans for not raising enough money and for not airing ads sooner. Those same intraparty critics breathed a sigh of relief once the state senator went up on air and intensified his ground game.\n\nFine also got a boost from a number of Republican allies including Trump, Florida Sen. Rick Scott and Florida Rep. Byron Donalds, who all participated in tele-town halls with Fine. He also got a small boost from outside donors, including Musk.\n\nThe increased ground game, coupled with paid media, was enough to activate the district’s Republican bases enough to allow Fine and Jimmy Patronis to win with comfortable margins.\n\nSo while Democrats had reason to be happy in the Sunshine State, Tuesday still emphasized just how steep a climb they face as they look to make inroads in what is now a ruby-red state.\n\nRepublicans underperformed\n\nDespite the fact Republicans turned out in Florida and ultimately nabbed wins, the party still underperformed in both special House elections, as well as in the Wisconsin race.\n\nIn Florida’s 6th District, Fine defeated his Democratic opponent Josh Weil by 14 points. Trump and Mike Waltz, the national security adviser who previously held the seat, won the district by more than 30 points in November.\n\nBut it was Democrat Gay Valimont’s overperformance in Florida’s 1st Congressional District that appeared to raise eyebrows even more. Patronis defeated Valimont by 14.8 points five months after Trump won the district by 37 points. Democrats also celebrated flipping Escambia County, which Valimont won it by just more than 3 points Tuesday after Trump won it by nearly 20 points in November.\n\nDemocrats described the results as a warning to Republicans.\n\nRepublicans, on the other hand, downplayed any notion of a silver lining for Democrats.\n\n“Florida’s resounding Republican victories send a clear message: Americans are fired up to elect leaders who will fight for President Trump’s agenda and reject the Democrats’ failed policies,” said Mike Marinella, spokesperson at the National Republican Congressional Committee. “While Democrats set their cash ablaze, House Republicans will keep hammering them for being out of touch — and we’ll crush them again in 2026.”\n\nIn Wisconsin, many counties were still reporting results as of Tuesday night. But in Fond du Lac, one of a handful of GOP counties reporting more than 95 percent of its ballots counted, Schimel appeared to underperform Trump, winning 60 percent of the vote in a county Trump won last year with roughly 64 percent.\n\nIn Florence, another county reporting more than 95 percent of ballots cast, Schimel narrowly trailed Trump, 73 percent to 75 percent.\n\nThat’s not to mention that Crawford appeared on track to flip the Trump-won districts of Outagamie, Racine and Kenosha.\n\nThe party’s underperformance was somewhat expected: Democrats have frequently dominated the GOP in turnout during off-year elections.\n\nGOP gets some breathing room in the House\n\nThe GOP’s Florida wins means the party will have two more lawmakers heading to the House soon — a welcome development for the party as it grapples with the challenge of passing key priorities with a very narrow margin.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has faced obstacles navigating the GOP’s tight 218-213 majority in the House as he seeks to pass Trump’s agenda. House Republicans are looking to pass a budget reconciliation package that would combine border security, tax legislation, and energy and defense spending. The loss of one or two seats would shave off Republican reinforcements in the House.\n\nThat point was made clear last week when Trump announced he was pulling Rep. Elise Stefanik’s (R-N.Y.) nomination to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nFine and Patronis were widely expected to win their races, but confirmation that the two districts will remain in GOP hands will come as a relief for Johnson."

He asked a friend to cut his grass, but that friend died, too!\n\nIn the two months Ficken was away, his grass grew taller than 10 inches.\n\nCity bureaucrats started fining him.\n\nBut they didn't tell Ficken that. When he finally got back, there was no notice of the $500-a-day fine. Only when he ran into a \"code enforcement officer\" did he learn he'd be getting \"a big bill.\"\n\nWhen the bill came, it was for $24,454.\n\nFicken quickly mowed his lawn. Then the city tacked on another $5,000 for \"non-compliance.\"\n\nFicken didn't have that much money, so city officials told him they would take his home.\n\nFortunately, Ficken discovered the libertarian law firm, the Institute for Justice, which fights government abuse.\n\nIJ lawyer Ari Bargil took on Ficken's case, arguing that the $30,000 fine violates the Constitution's limits on \"excessive bail, fines, and cruel punishments.\"\n\nBut a judge ruled that the fine was \"not excessive.\"\n\nOf course, judges are just lawyers with robes. Often they are lawyer/bureaucrats who've become very comfortable with big government.\n\nI call a $30K penalty for not cutting your lawn absurdly excessive,\n\nIJ attorney Bargil told local news stations, \"If $30,000 for tall grass in Florida is not excessive, it is hard to imagine what is.\"\n\nDunedin's politicians often impose heavy fines for minor transgressions.\n\nOne resident told us, \"They fined me $32,000 for a hole the size of a quarter in my stucco ... For a lawn mower in my yard ... They fine people they can pick on ... and they keep picking on them.\"\n\nIt happens elsewhere, too.\n\nCharlotte, North Carolina, fined a church for \"excessive pruning.\"\n\nDanbury, Connecticut, charged a resident $200,000 for leaving his yard messy.\n\nBargil notes, \"It's pretty apparent that code enforcement is a major cash cow.\"\n\nIn just five-and-a-half years, Dunedin collected $3.6 million in fines.\n\nBut by then, I and others had noticed. We were reporting on Dunedin's heavy fines.\n\nSo did the politicians sheepishly acknowledge that they had milked citizens with excessive fines and give the money back?\n\nOf course not. They hired a PR firm. That cost taxpayers another $25,000 a month.\n\nPoliticians care mostly about themselves.\n\nAfter The Institute for Justice filed a second lawsuit, Dunedin agreed that Ficken could pay less: $10,000.\n\nStill too much, but Ficken agreed.\n\n\"Our Founders,\" says Bargil, \"recognized that the ability to fine is the ability to cripple. It's one of the ways, other than incarceration, that government can really oppress.\"\n\nGovernment routinely oppresses. For six long years, Dunedin's politicians oppressed Jim Ficken.\n\nEvery Tuesday at JohnStossel.com, Stossel posts a new video about the battle between government and freedom.

        "full_text": "Oliver Stone, the Oscar-winning director whose film JFK portrayed the President John F. Kennedy’s assassination as the work of government conspiracy yesterday called for a new congressional investigation into his killing.\n\nStone, 78, testified at a hearing of the House Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets following last month’s release of thousands of pages of government documents related to the assassination.\n\nJFK was nominated for eight Oscars, winning two, and grossed over $200 million (€185 million) at the box office. Stone described his film as a “counter-myth” to the “fictional myth” of the Warren Commission, established to investigate Kennedy’s assassination.\n\nAt the time of its release in 1991, JFK was criticised for its historical accuracy. Stone told the committee that he believes decades of delays in releasing unredacted records had prevented “clarity” about who killed Kennedy.\n\nStone also said a new investigation “outside all political considerations” should begin “at the scene of the crime” and re-examine all of the evidence from the day of the assassination. Experts have concluded that there's strong evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald, a 24-year-old former Marine, acted alone in killing Kennedy.\n\n“Can we return to a world where we can trust our government to level with us, the people for which this government exists?” Stone said. “This is our democracy. This is our presidency. It belongs to us.”\n\nWhether Oswald acted alone in fatally shooting Kennedy on a motorcade route in Dallas on 22 November 1963 was the task force’s first line of questioning.\n\nScholars say the files that President Donald Trump ordered to be released showed nothing undercutting the conclusion that a lone gunman killed Kennedy. Many documents were previously released but contained newly removed redactions, including Social Security numbers, angering people whose personal information was disclosed.\n\nThe task force’s chair, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, said she thinks the federal government under previous administrations had engaged in “stonewalling.”\n\nThe task force also invited Jefferson Morley and James DiEugenio, who have written books arguing for conspiracies behind the assassination. Morley is editor of the JFK Facts blog and vice president of the Mary Ferrell Foundation, a repository for files related to the assassination.\n\nThe last formal congressional investigation of Kennedy's assassination ended in 1978, when a House committee issued a report concluding that the Soviet Union, Cuba, organized crime, the CIA and the FBI weren't involved, but Kennedy “probably was assassinated as a result of a conspiracy.”\n\nIn 1976, a Senate committee said it had not uncovered enough evidence “to justify a conclusion that there was a conspiracy.”\n\nThe Warren Commission, appointed by Kennedy's successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, concluded that Oswald fired on Kennedy's motorcade from a sniper's perch on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository.\n\nPolice arrested Oswald within 90 minutes, and two days later, Jack Ruby, a nightclub owner, shot Oswald during a jail transfer broadcast on live television."

Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, joins 'Fox News Live' to discuss the extradition of a Honduran migrant who was allegedly involved in a 2016 drunken driving death and the Senate GOP's effort to expose federal waste with the 'DOGE Madness' bracket.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: The respective chairs of the Small Business Committee in both chambers of Congress are unveiling a plan to address the roughly 2 million \"likely fraudulent\" pandemic aid applications flagged in a recent government report.\n\nSen. Joni Ernst of Iowa and Rep. Roger Williams of Texas, both Republicans, plan to introduce the SBA Fraud Enforcement Extension Act on Wednesday in hopes of corralling the alleged scofflaws who they say broke the law and prevented untold numbers of legitimate U.S. small businesses from receiving crucial aid.\n\nThe bill extends the statute of limitations to 10 years for fraud surrounding the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant (SVOG) and the Restaurant Revitalization Fund relief programs instituted in 2020.\n\nIn 2022, Williams, Ernst and other lawmakers sought to do the same to identify potential scofflaw violators of the Paycheck Protection Program.\n\nHOUSE SMALL BUSINESS COMMITTEE RELEASES REPORT ON BIDEN-ERA ELECTIONEERING\n\nA report from the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the Biden-era Small Business Administration (SBA) either signed or guaranteed more than $1 trillion in loans to more than 10 million small businesses.\n\nWhile it had instituted a four-step process to manage fraud, that plan reportedly faltered when the SBA inspector general was unable to fully probe two-thirds of the risk referrals because the agency didn’t provide either correct or complete information about those cases.\n\nThe GAO then made a formal recommendation to the SBA, which, according to the public watchdog’s website, remains \"open\" – and it appeared no action had at least been recorded.\n\nThe GAO also found that the fraud prevention process had not been fully implemented until \"more than half\" of aid programs’ funding had been approved.\n\nLAWMAKERS SLAM SBA ‘STONEWALLING’ OVER MICHIGAN VOTER MEMO AS ELECTIONEERING CLAIMS SURFACE\n\n\"I will not allow criminals to run out the clock and escape justice simply because the Biden administration was asleep at the wheel,\" Ernst told Fox News Digital on Tuesday.\n\n\"Thousands of hardworking small businesses were deprived of desperately needed relief because swindlers, gang members, and felons cashing in on COVID drained the programs. Every single con artist who stole from taxpayers will be held accountable.\"\n\nIn Ernst’s home state, 1,800 restaurants reportedly qualified for SBA aid but never received it, prompting critics to question how much funding was diverted to fraudulent applicants instead of family-run eateries.\n\nIn Williams’ Lone Star State, federal aid allowed tens of thousands of restaurants to stay in business, but others told outlets like Houston PBS that such funding ran out before many could get back on their financial feet.\n\nLAWMAKERS DEMAND ANSWERS FROM TOP MICHIGAN OFFICIAL OVER ALLEGED ‘WEAPONIZATION’ OF TAXPAYER FUNDS FOR ELECTIONEERING\n\nFormer President Joe Biden and Rep. Roger Williams (Getty)\n\nThe Texas Restaurant Association told the station that 12,000 restaurants found themselves in danger of closing by 2022.\n\nHollywood celebrities had also received some of the SVOG funds and spent them on private jets and parties or cash for themselves, Business Insider reported.\n\n\"The SBA distributes millions of dollars to small businesses in need every year. However, where small business owners found the capital needed to stay afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic, bad actors saw the opportunity to defraud the government,\" Williams told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"It is imperative that every fraudster who stole and exploited taxpayer dollars during our nation’s utmost hour of need be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe added that as March marked five years after the first COVID lockdowns, an extension of the SBA and law enforcement’s ability to pursue fraudsters must be realized.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to the SBA for comment.\n\nWhen asked about the discrepancies found in the GAO report, an SBA spokesperson told Fox News Digital that Administrator Kelly Loeffler has already taken action to enhance fraud prevention efforts.\n\n\"The SBA fully supports all efforts to crack down on fraud within its loan programs – in stark contrast to the last administration, which failed to investigate or address more than $200B in estimated pandemic-era fraud,\" Caitlin O’Dea said.\n\n\"[SBA] will continue working to hold pandemic-era fraudsters accountable.\"\n\nCharles Creitz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.\n\nHe joined Fox News in 2013 as a writer and production assistant.\n\nCharles covers media, politics and culture for Fox News Digital.\n\nCharles is a Pennsylvania native and graduated from Temple University with a B.A. in Broadcast Journalism.

        "full_text": "Attorney General Pam Bondi said Tuesday that federal prosecutors will pursue the death penalty for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of gunning down United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson in front of a New York hotel last year.\n\n“Luigi Mangione’s murder of Brian Thompson – an innocent man and father of two young children – was a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America,” Ms. Bondi said in a statement. “After careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump’s agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again.”\n\nThe Justice Department said Mr. Mangione’s alleged actions involved substantial planning and premeditation because it took place in public with bystanders nearby and may have posed a “grave risk of death” to members of the public.\n\nMr. Mangione is facing both state and federal charges arising from the killing of Thompson and has pleaded not guilty. He will head to court on the state charges first.\n\nOn the federal level, Mr. Mangione faces 11 charges, including first-degree murder in furtherance of terrorism, two counts of stalking and one count each of murder through the use of a firearm and a firearms offense. Murder by firearm carries the possibility of the death penalty. New York state has charged him with murder and terror charges.\n\nA federal judge overseeing the case in February appointed a death penalty expert to Mr. Mangione’s defense team.\n\nThe attack occurred on a Manhattan street last December outside the Hilton Hotel as Thompson walked to UnitedHealth’s annual investor meeting.\n\nThe murder prompted widespread discussion on corporate greed and unfairness in the medical insurance industry, with some even elevating Thompson’s killer to folk-hero status.\n\nFederal prosecutors say Mr. Mangione had a spiral notebook that included several handwritten pages expressing anger toward the health insurance industry and wealthy CEOs. UnitedHealthcare is the largest health insurer in the U.S., though it has publicly stated that Mr. Mangione was never a client.\n\nA federal jury can recommend the death penalty if the defendant “had the requisite culpability with respect to the victim’s death.” However, a jury must also vote unanimously “that the aggravating factor or factors it has found sufficiently outweigh any mitigating factors to justify a capital sentence.”\n\nIf the jury does not unanimously vote for the death penalty, the defendant can be given a lesser sentence.\n\nMr. Mangione is the first defendant to face the death penalty since Mr. Trump announced in January that he will resume executions of federal death row prisoners and forcefully pursue new death sentences in future cases.\n\nIn an executive order signed shortly after being sworn in, Mr. Trump called on the attorney general to seek the death penalty for crimes “of a severity demanding its use.” Those circumstances include when law enforcement officials are murdered and when illegal immigrants are capital defendants.\n\nMr. Trump’s renewed use of the death penalty came after President Biden signed an executive order commuting the sentences of 37 of the 40 prisoners on federal death row."

Since taking office, Trump has reinstated his \"maximum pressure\" campaign, which has led to the reimposition of strict sanctions in order to weaken Iran's economy and stop its nuclear program. While Tehran has denied seeking nuclear weapons, recent warnings signal a growing risk of escalation.\n\nAli Larijani, a senior adviser to Khamenei, told Iranian state television that Iran does not seek nuclear weapons but could be forced to pursue them if threatened.\n\n\"We are not moving towards (nuclear) weapons, but if you do something wrong in the Iranian nuclear issue, you will force Iran to move towards that because it has to defend itself,\" Larijani said. He cautioned that any U.S. or Israeli military action would push Tehran toward reconsidering its nuclear stance.\n\nLast week, U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, said that Washington does not believe Iran is developing nuclear weapons but noted a weakening taboo in Iran against publicly discussing them.\n\nTrump's remarks over the weekend intensified the standoff. \"There will be bombing\" if Iran does not agree to a nuclear deal, he told NBC. Trump also threatened to impose \"secondary tariffs\" on Tehran.\n\nIran's Supreme Leader dismissed the warnings. \"They threaten to do mischief,\" Khamenei said during a speech on Monday. \"If it is carried out, they will definitely receive a strong reciprocal blow.\"\n\nLast month, Trump said he wrote to Khamenei urging nuclear talks and warning of possible military action. Iran's foreign minister confirmed that a response was sent back to Washington through Oman. He ruled out direct talks under pressure but hinted at the possibility of indirect negotiations.\n\nAli Larijani, adviser to Khamenei, said on Iranian state TV: \"Iran does not want to do this, but will have no choice. If at some point you (the U.S.) move towards bombing by yourself or through Israel, you will force Iran to make a different decision.\"\n\nTrita Parsi, Executive Vice President of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft told Newsweek: \"The war of words are heating up between Washington and Tehran as Trump is threatening full-scale bombing and Tehran warns of swift retaliation. Neither side wants war and both sides appear to treat this as a prelude to negotiations. However, unless realistic bargaining positions are adopted by both sides and a discarding of maximalist approaches, this escalatory rhetoric may trap them both in a war that neither side wants.\"\n\nIran's foreign ministry has summoned the charge d'affaires of the Swiss embassy, which represents U.S. interests in Tehran, following Trump's remarks. With the diplomatic impasse continuing, the question remains whether Washington will escalate its threats or pursue alternative negotiations."

        "full_text": "The deportation flight was in the air over Mexico when chaos erupted in the back of the plane, the flight attendant recalled. A little girl had collapsed. She had a high fever and was taking ragged, frantic breaths.\n\nThe flight attendant, a young woman who went by the nickname Lala, said she grabbed the plane’s emergency oxygen bottle and rushed past rows of migrants chained at the wrists and ankles to reach the girl and her parents.\n\nBy then, Lala was accustomed to the hard realities of working charter flights for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She’d learned to obey instructions not to look the passengers in the eyes, not to greet them or ask about their well-being. But until the girl collapsed, Lala had managed to escape an emergency.\n\nLala worked for Global Crossing Airlines, the dominant player in the loose network of deportation contractors known as ICE Air. GlobalX, as the charter company is also called, is lately in the news. Two weeks ago, it helped the Trump administration fly hundreds of Venezuelans to El Salvador despite a federal court order blocking the deportations, triggering a showdown that experts fear could become a full-blown constitutional crisis.\n\nIn interviews with ProPublica, Lala and six other current and former GlobalX flight attendants provided a window into a part of the deportation process that is rarely seen and little understood. For migrants who have spent months or years trying to reach this country and live here, it is the last act, the final bit of America they may experience.\n\nAll but one of the flight attendants requested anonymity or asked that only a nickname be used, fearing retribution or black marks as they looked for new jobs in an insular industry.\n\nBecause ICE, GlobalX and other charter carriers did not respond to questions after being provided with detailed lists of this story’s findings, the flight attendants’ individual accounts are hard to verify. But their stories are consistent with one another. They are also generally consistent with what has been said about ICE Air in legal filings, news accounts, academic research and publicly released copies of the ICE Air Operations Handbook.\n\nThat morning over Mexico, Lala said, the girl’s oxygen saturation level was 70% — perilously low compared with a healthy person’s 95% or higher. Her temperature was 102.3 degrees. The flight had a nurse on contract who worked alongside its security guards. But beyond giving the girl Tylenol, the nurse left the situation in Lala’s hands, she recalled.\n\nLala broke the rule about talking to detainees. The parents told Lala their daughter had a history of asthma. The mom, who Lala said had epilepsy, seemed on the verge of her own medical crisis.\n\nLala placed the oxygen mask on the girl’s face. The nurse removed her socks to keep her from further overheating. Lala counted down the minutes, praying for the girl to keep breathing.\n\nThe stories shared by ICE Air flight attendants paint a different picture of deportations from the one presented to the public, especially under President Donald Trump. On social media, the White House has depicted a military operation carried out with ruthless efficiency, using Air Force C-17s, ICE agents in tactical vests and soldiers in camo.\n\nThe reality is that 85% of the administration’s “removal” flights — 254 flights as of March 21, according to the advocacy group Witness at the Border — have been on charter planes. Military flights have now all but ceased. While there are ICE officers and hired security guards on the charters, the crew members on board are civilians, ordinary people swept up in something most didn’t knowingly sign up for.\n\nWhen the flight attendants joined GlobalX, it was a startup with big plans. It sold investors and new hires alike on a vision of VIP clients, including musicians and sports teams, and luxury destinations, especially in the Caribbean. “You can’t beat the eXperience,” read a company tagline.\n\nBut as the airline grew, more and more of its planes were filled with migrants in chains. Some flight attendants were livid about it.\n\nLast year, an anonymous GlobalX employee sent an all-caps, all-staff screed that ricocheted around the startup. “WHERE IS THE COMPANY GOING?” the email asked. “YOU SIGNED A 5 YEAR CONTRACT WITH ICE? ... WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS BECOMING A PRESTIGE CHARTER AIRLINE?”\n\nOne flight attendant said he kept waiting for the sports teams his new bosses had talked about as he flew deportation routes. “You know, the NFL charters, the NBA charters, whatever the hockey one is …” he said.\n\nA second said his planes’ air conditioning kept breaking — an experience consistent with at least two publicly reported onboard incidents — and their lavatories kept breaking, something another flight attendant reported as well. But the planes kept flying. “They made us flush with water bottles,” he said.\n\nBut the flight attendants were most concerned about their inability to treat their passengers humanely — and to keep them safe. (In 2021, an ICE spokesperson told the publication Capital & Main that the agency “follows best practices when it comes to the security, safety and welfare of the individuals returned to their countries of origin.”)\n\nThey worried about what would happen in an emergency. Could they really get over a hundred chained passengers off the plane in time?\n\n“They never taught us anything regarding the immigration flights,” one said. “They didn’t tell us these people were going to be shackled, wrists to fucking ankles.”\n\n“We have never gotten a clear answer on what we do in an ICE Air evacuation,” another said. “They will not give us an answer.”\n\n“It’s only a matter of time,” a third said, before a deportation flight ends in disaster.\n\nLala didn’t think she had a chance at a flight attendant job. She hadn’t, in truth, remembered applying to GlobalX until a recruiter called to say the startup was coming to her city. “But I guess I did apply through LinkedIn?” she said. She’d been working an office job — long hours, little flexibility — and was looking for something new.\n\nThe job interviews were held at a resort hotel. The room was packed with dozens of aspirants when Lala showed up. After the first round, only about 20 were asked to stay. She couldn’t believe she was one of them. After the second round came a job offer: $26 an hour plus a daily expense allowance. Soon Lala got a uniform: a blue cardigan, a white polo shirt and an eye-catching scarf in cyan and light green.\n\nFor part of her Federal Aviation Administration-mandated four-week training, her class stayed in a motel with a pool at the edge of Miami International Airport. Just across the street, on the fourth floor of a concrete-clad office building ringed by palm trees, was GlobalX’s headquarters.\n\n“In the beginning, we were told that because it’s a charter, it’s only gonna be elites, celebrities,” Lala said. “Everybody was really excited.”\n\nBut flying was not going to be all glitz. The real reason for having flight attendants is safety. GlobalX was certified by the FAA as a Part 121 scheduled air carrier, the same as United or Delta, and it and its crew members were subject to the same strict standards.\n\n“We’re there to evacuate you,” one recruit told ProPublica. “Yes, we make good drinks, but we evacuate you.”\n\nLala’s class practiced water landings in the pool at the nearby Pan Am Flight Academy. They practiced door drills — yelling out commands, shoving open heavy exit doors — in a replica Airbus A320 cabin. They learned CPR and how to put out fires. They took written and physical tests, and if they didn’t score at least 90%, they had to retake them.\n\nThey were reminded, over and over, that their job was a vocation, one with a professional code: No matter who the passengers were, flight attendants were in charge of the cabin, responsible for safety in the air.\n\nLala’s official “airman” certificate arrived from the FAA a few weeks after training was done. She was cleared to fly, ready to see the world.\n\nBut what she would see wasn’t what she signed up for. The company was growing beyond glamorous charters. GlobalX was moving into the deportation business.\n\nHer bosses delivered the news casually, she recalled: “It was like, ‘Oh yeah, we got a government contract.’”\n\nThe new graduates were offered a single posting: Harlingen, Texas. Deportation flights were five days a week, sometimes late into the night. Lala went to Guatemala, Honduras, Colombia and, for refueling, Panama.\n\nA standard flight had more than a dozen private security guards — contractors working for the firm Akima — along with a single ICE officer, two nurses, and a hundred or more detainees. (Akima did not respond to a request for comment.) The guards were in charge of delivering food and water to the detainees and taking them to the lavatories. This left the flight attendants, whose presence was required by the FAA, with little to do.\n\n“Arm and disarm doors, that was our duty,” Lala said.\n\nThe flights had their own set of rules, which the crew members said they learned from a company policy manual or from chief flight attendants. Don’t talk to the detainees. Don’t feed them. Don’t make eye contact. Don’t walk down the aisles without a guard escorting you. Don’t sit in aisle seats, where detainees could get close to you. Don’t wear your company-issued scarf because of “safety concerns that a detainee might grab it and use it against us,” Lala said.\n\n“You don’t do nothing,” said a member of another GlobalX class. “Just sit down in your seats and be quiet.” If a detainee looked at him, he was supposed to look out the window.\n\nA rare public statement from the company about life aboard ICE Air came in a 2023 earnings call with GlobalX founder and then-CEO Ed Wegel, when he discussed the company’s work for federal agencies like ICE. GlobalX employees “essentially don’t do much on the airplane,” Wegel said. “Our flight attendants are there in case of an emergency. The passengers are monitored by guards that are placed on board the airplane by one of those agencies.”\n\nFielding a question about how GlobalX ensures passengers are treated humanely, Wegel continued: “There have been threats made to our crew members, and they’re especially trained to deal with those. But we haven’t seen any mistreatment at all.”\n\nFlight attendants said they had little to do but sit in their jumpseats after delivering the preflight safety briefing in English to the mostly Spanish-speaking passengers. Above 10,000 feet, the two in the rear usually moved to passenger rows near the cockpit, then sat again. Some did crosswords. Others took photos out the window. On a deportation to Guatemala, one saw his first erupting volcano.\n\nLala had been scared before her first deportation flight, worried that violence might break out. But fear soon gave way to discomfort at how detainees were treated. “Not being able to serve them, not being able to look at them, I didn’t think that was right,” she said.\n\nSome flight attendants, drawn to the profession because they liked taking care of people, couldn’t help but break protocol with passengers. “If they said ‘hola’ or something,” one said, “I’d say ‘hola’ back. We’re not jerks.”\n\nAnother recalled taking a planeload of children and their escorts on a domestic transfer from the southern border to an airport in New York. He tried to slip snacks to the kids. “Even the chaperones were like, ‘Don’t give them any food,’” he said. “And I’m like, ‘Where is your humanity?’” (A second flight attendant said that children on a New York flight were fed by their escorts.)\n\nWhile flight attendants were allowed to interact with the guards, the dynamic was uncomfortable. It came down to a question of who was in charge — and which agency, ICE or the FAA, ultimately held sway. (The FAA declined to comment on this story and directed questions to ICE.)\n\nThe guards often asked flight attendants to heat up the food they brought from home. They asked for drinks, for ice. “They treated us like we were their maids,” said Akilah Sisk, a former flight attendant from Texas.\n\n“In their eyes, the detainees are not the passengers,” another flight attendant said. “The passengers are the guards. And we’re there for the guards.”\n\nSome guards thumbed their noses at the FAA safety rules that flight attendants were supposed to enforce while airborne, multiple flight attendants recalled. “One reported me because I asked him to sit down in the last 10 minutes,” Sisk said. “But you’re still on a freaking plane. You gotta listen to our words.”\n\nFlight attendants said that if they told guards to fasten seatbelts during takeoff or stow carry-ons under a seat, they risked getting reported to their bosses at GlobalX, who they said wanted to keep ICE happy. The guards would complain to the in-flight supervisor, Sisk said, and eventually it would get back to the flight attendant.\n\n“We’d get an email from somebody in management: ‘Why are you guys causing problems?’” another flight attendant recalled. “They were more worried about losing the contract than about anything else.”\n\nNothing bothered flight attendants more than the fact that most of their passengers were in chains. What would happen if a flight had to be evacuated?\n\nMost of the migrants crowding the back seats of ICE Air’s planes have not been, historically, convicted criminals. ICE makes restraints mandatory nonetheless. “Detainees transported by ICE Air aircraft will be fully restrained by the use of handcuffs, waist chains, and leg irons,“ reads an unredacted version of the 2015 ICE Air Operations Handbook, which was obtained by the Center for Constitutional Rights, a legal advocacy group.\n\nThe handbook allows for other equipment “in special circumstances, i.e., spit masks, mittens, leg braces, cargo straps, humane restraint blanket, etc.” Multiple lawsuits on behalf of African asylum-seekers concern the use of one such item, known as the Wrap, a cross between a straitjacket and a sleeping bag. A flight attendant said detainees restrained in the device are strapped upright in their seats or, if less compliant, lengthwise across a row of seats. Getting “burritoed, I call it,” the person said.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties investigated the asylum-seekers’ complaints and found ICE lacked “sufficient policies” on the Wrap, but how the immigration agency addressed the finding is not publicly known. ICE responded to one lawsuit by saying detainees were not abused; it said another should be dismissed, in part because it was filed in the wrong place. The cases are pending.\n\nUse of the Wrap continues. A video from Seattle’s Boeing Field taken in February shows officers and guards carrying a wrapped migrant into the cabin of a deportation plane.\n\nNeither the ICE Air handbook, nor FAA regulations, nor flight attendant training in Miami explained how to empty a plane full of people whose movements were, by design, so severely hampered. Shackled detainees didn’t even qualify as “able-bodied” enough to sit in exit rows.\n\nTo flight attendants, the restraints seemed at odds with the FAA’s “90-second rule,” a decades-old manufacturing standard that says an aircraft must be built for full evacuation in 90 seconds even with half the exits blocked.\n\nLala and others said no one told them how to evacuate passengers in chains. “Honestly, I don’t know what we would do,” she said.\n\nThe flight attendants are not alone in voicing concerns.\n\nIn an interview with ProPublica, Bobby Laurie, an airline safety expert and former flight attendant, called the arrangement on ICE Air flights “disturbing.”\n\n“Part of flight attendant training is locating those passengers who can help you in an evacuation,” Laurie told ProPublica. That would have to be the guards. “But if they have to help you,” who is helping the detainees, Laurie wondered.\n\nAccording to formal ICE Air incident reports reviewed by Capital & Main, the deportation network had at least six accidents requiring evacuations between 2014 and 2019. In at least two cases, both on a carrier called World Atlantic, the evacuations were led not by flight attendants but by untrained guards. Both took longer than 90 seconds, though not by much: two-and-a-half minutes for the first, “less than 2 minutes” for the next. But in a third case, it took seven minutes for 115 shackled detainees to escape a smoke-filled jet.\n\nIn one of the World Atlantic incidents, part of the landing gear broke, a wing caught fire and the smell of burning rubber seeped in, according to investigative records obtained by the University of Washington Center for Human Rights. In an email to ICE Air officials, an agency employee aboard the plane later wrote that flight attendants made no emergency announcements for passengers. The flight attendants simply got themselves out.\n\nThe ICE officer, guards and nurse were “confused on what to do and in which direction to exit during distress,” the officer wrote. He said that other than the flight crew, “no one has received any training on emergency evacuation situations.”\n\nThe University of Washington’s collection does not include findings or recommendations from ICE based on what happened, and ICE did not say what they were when asked by ProPublica. The National Transportation Safety Board said that after the accident, World Atlantic launched a campaign to reinspect landing gear, gave employees and contractors further training, and revised its procedures for inspections. The airline did not respond to questions from ProPublica.\n\nOther reports obtained by the University of Washington mention fuel spills, loss of cabin air pressure and a “large altercation” on ICE Air after 2019 but no more evacuations, at least as of June 2022. More recent incidents that have been mentioned in the press include an engine fire last summer on World Atlantic and a failed GlobalX air conditioning unit that sent 11 detainees to the hospital with “heat-related injuries.”\n\nThe rare guidance some flight attendants said they received on carrying out ICE Air evacuations came during briefings from pilots. What they heard, they said, was chilling and went against their training.\n\n“Just get up and leave,” one recalled a GlobalX pilot telling him. “That’s it. … Save your life first.”\n\nHe understood the instructions to mean that evacuating detainees was not a priority, or even the flight attendants’ responsibility. The detainees were in other people’s hands, or in no one’s.\n\nWhen asked if they got similar guidance from pilots, three flight attendants said they did not, and one did not answer. Two more, like the first, said pilots gave them instructions that they took to mean they shouldn’t help detainees after opening the exit doors.\n\n“That was the normal briefing,” said a flight attendant from Lala’s class. “‘If a fire occurs in the cabin, if we land on water, don’t check on the immigrants. Just make sure that you and the guards and the people that work for the government get off.’”\n\n“It was as if the detainees’ lives were worthless,” said the other.\n\nThe day the girl collapsed on Lala’s flight, the pilot turned the plane around and they crossed back into the United States.\n\nThe flight landed in Arizona. Paramedics rushed on board and connected the girl to their own oxygen bottle. They began shuttling her off the plane. Her parents tried to join. But the guards stopped the father.\n\nShocked, Lala approached the ICE officer in charge. “This is not OK!” she yelled. The mom had seizures. The family needed to stay together.\n\nBut the officer said it was impossible. Only one parent could go to the hospital. The other, as Lala understood it, “was going to get deported.”\n\nMost of the flight attendants who spoke with ProPublica are now gone from GlobalX. Some left because they found other jobs. Some left even though they hadn’t. Some left because the charter company, as it focused more and more on deportations, shut down the hub in their city.\n\nLala eventually left because of the little girl and her family, because she couldn’t do the deportation flights anymore. Her GlobalX uniform hung in her closet for a time, a reminder of her career as a flight attendant. Recently, she said, she threw it away.\n\nShe never learned whether the little girl lived or died. Lala just watched her mom follow her off the plane, then watched the dad return to his seat.\n\n“I cried after that,” she said. She bought her own ticket home."

        "full_text": "On March 24, a shadowy group that calls itself Canary Mission posted a new feature on its website, “Uncovering Foreign Nationals,” in response to President Trump’s recent executive order on combating antisemitism.\n\nThe group, which says its mission is to single out those who promote “hatred of the U.S.A., Israel and Jews on North American college campuses,” listed the names of seven students and academics, including three current and former professors at Columbia University.\n\nThe seven people whom Canary Mission flagged, all of whom the group says could be deported because they are not U.S. citizens, are among thousands of people whose pictures, along with details of their alleged antisemitic activities, have been posted on Canary’s website since its creation a decade ago — all accused of anti-Israeli activism.\n\nSince the Trump administration began targeting students in a sweeping immigration crackdown last month, nine students and professors, several of whom had engaged in protests or other activism over Israel’s war in Gaza, have been either threatened with deportation or detained. Three of them had appeared on the Canary Mission website.\n\nThe actions taken in recent weeks against these foreign students and academics, many of them highly accomplished in their fields, have raised questions about why federal authorities are singling them out, and what role outside groups like Canary Mission are playing in identifying targets for deportation.\n\nIn a briefing on Monday, a State Department spokeswoman, asked about whether such lists played a role in decision-making, said the agency would not discuss “what happens with individuals and visas, and whether they’re issued or if they’re revoked.”\n\nThe federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency has said that it does not rely on lists from Canary Mission, and some of the students who’ve been targeted by federal agents do not appear on any of the lists.\n\nYet some of them do. And immigration lawyers and experts point to coincidences that suggest to them that the information circulated by Canary Mission and another pro-Israel group, Betar, may be providing road maps for ICE enforcement actions.\n\nRumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish graduate student at Tufts University, learned in early March that her photograph and résumé had been posted on Canary Mission’s website, which claimed that she had “engaged in anti-Israel activism.”\n\nDetails about Canary Mission’s leadership, origins and funding are murky, with a few exceptions.\n\nThe group has not sought tax-exempt status in the United States, meaning that, unlike most American nonprofit organizations, it does not file disclosure statements about its leadership and budget with the federal government. It also does not list a physical address.\n\nNews organizations have cited tax records showing contributions to the group from various Jewish foundations, and in 2021, Jewish Currents reported a $50,000 contribution from Michael Leven, a Jewish philanthropist who is the former chief operating officer of the Las Vegas Sands Corp., the luxury hotel and resort operator.\n\nMr. Leven told Jewish Currents at the time that he hoped to help “identify significant antisemites” and “bring the knowledge of their antisemitism to the surface.” While he paused his contributions at some point, he said in an email on Tuesday that his donations had resumed.\n\nCanary Mission, asked if it had shared information on potential deportation targets with federal authorities, said that it had not. “Our investigations of anti-U.S. and antisemitic extremists are all publicly available on our website,” the group said in a statement.\n\nBetar, though, has openly said it is distributing a “deport list” of 3,000 immigrants who it said had engaged in support for terrorism, with some names already submitted to government officials.\n\n“We have provided thousands of names of jihadis to the Trump administration of visitors to America who support Hamas,” Betar said in a statement.\n\nBetar is a 100-year-old Zionist organization that now claims 35 chapters worldwide. The group has been labeled extremist by the Anti-Defamation League, which said its research showed that Betar had adopted the far-right slogan “Every Jew, a .22,” openly embraced Islamophobia and harassed Muslims online and in person.\n\nBetar denied the organization’s characterization, adding that it stood behind “the right of every Jew to defend themselves, their families and their communities.”\n\nOn March 13, Betar posted what it called a “deport alert” aimed at Momodou Taal, a British-Gambian graduate student at Cornell University who has also been targeted by ICE. Perhaps coincidentally, the State Department has said it moved to revoke Mr. Taal’s visa on March 14, the day after the alert was sent.\n\nMr. Taal posted on social media Monday that he had elected to leave the country, abandoning a federal court fight to remain.\n\nJonathan Wallace, a lawyer representing one of the seven “deportable” people posted on Canary Mission’s “Uncovering Foreign Nationals” web page, called the group a “predator in the ecosystem that we’re living in right now.” Critics say the lists amount to doxxing, the publishing of private information about someone with malicious intent.\n\n“Unfortunately, a prime way of having ICE turn up at your door is if you’re being actively doxxed,” said Mr. Wallace, the lawyer for Mohamed Abdou, a former visiting professor at Columbia whose contract was not renewed last year.\n\nThe list of seven is just a tiny sampling of the more than 2,000 online dossiers Canary Mission has posted on its website, some dating back as far as 2015. Many of those listed are not immigrants, but American professors and students from across the country who have been active in campus protests against Israeli government policies. Several of those listed are Jewish.\n\nZachary Lockman, a New York University professor of Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies, sees the group as part of a broader campaign to discredit opponents of Israeli government policy, a movement that has gained steam since last year’s U.S. presidential election, the Oct. 7 attack on Israel led by Hamas and the subsequent war in Gaza.\n\n“This has all been underway for decades,” Dr. Lockman said. “Obviously since Oct. 7, it’s escalated dramatically. And since Trump took office, they have the government on their side in a very active way.”"

        "full_text": "President Trump is right. We should junk the debt limit.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office announced this week that the US government will run out of money this July or August unless Congress raises the debt limit, which puts a ceiling on what Uncle Sam can borrow.\n\nCongress should have raised the limit at the beginning of this year but didn't. Since then, Washington has been using cash reserves and so-called emergency measures to pay its bills. Delaying taxpayer refunds is one possible ploy and playing around with the civil service pensions funds is another.\n\nRevenues surge in March and April thanks to corporate and personal income tax deadlines. A smaller bump comes in June when quarterly tax payments are due.\n\nBut not long after, the till runs out.\n\nIf the debt ceiling is not raised by then, the US, for the first time in its history, could default on its debts, either by missing interest payments or not redeeming maturing bonds. If that actually happened, shock waves would hit financial markets around the world. We came close to that in 2011. Faith in the dollar would be damaged and its value would go down, a sure-fire formula for future inflation.\n\nInterest rates on bonds would go up.\n\nThe debt limit has been around since WWI. Defenders say it is a crucial tool to stop even more spending.\n\nWell, we painfully see today how well that has worked in forcing fiscal prudence.\n\nRaising the ceiling is often preceded by lots of drama—social security benefits and payments for Medicare and Medicaid will be in danger, are routine cries—as a deadline approaches. Resolving the crisis then requires deals with various congressional members to get the job done. In fact, too many times, the process has ended up generating even more spending.\n\nPresident Trump was right last December when he called for dropping the debt limit altogether.\n\nFiscal sanity won't come from what is a charade. So let's stop the pretense and focus on real measures to get our financial house in order.\n\nProductive policies would include cutting tax rates, cutting unnecessary spending, rooting out waste, fraud and abuse, pursuing deep deregulation, generating more revenue from expanding energy production—hmm! Does all this sound familiar?\n\nAnother necessity is forcing the Federal Reserve to focus on stabilizing the value of the dollar rather than suppressing economic activity.\n\nFor now, Congressional Republicans seem likely to include a big boost in the debt limit in its upcoming tax cut legislation.\n\nAfter that, let's retire the debt limit show to the Smithsonian.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​"

        "full_text": "In America, our leaders shouldn’t hide from the people they represent. That is why I recently held town halls in three congressional districts — California’s 22nd, 40th and 41st districts — that are key for winning back the House in 2026. All three are currently held by Republicans, and I plan to travel to red districts in Pennsylvania, Nebraska, Nevada and Ohio in the upcoming months.\n\nWhile GOP lawmakers are canceling town halls after being booed and protested, I am working alongside community leaders and advocates to build a movement with two goals: mobilize voters in swing districts and block Republicans’ cuts to Medicaid and education funding.\n\nMeetings with constituents and voters are a core part of our democracy.\n\nAmericans are scared and they deserve the chance to ask their representatives why they voted for a budget plan that hurts the working class. With that in mind, I am visiting districts where there is a high percentage of residents on Medicaid. I am spending my time and resources immersed in these districts — meeting with working-class Americans and organizing. In the 22nd district, where I held my first town hall, 64% of residents are on Medicaid. It’s deeply disappointing that their own member of Congress wouldn’t show up to discuss his vote on a budget that would cut this program.\n\nRepublicans tried to dismiss my town halls as a “stunt,” but meetings with constituents and voters are a core part of our democracy. I hold one in my own district every single month, and I believe it is something that every member of Congress should do in person — no matter how tough the questions might be.\n\nAround 1,000 people came to each of my town halls, ready to ask questions and fight for change. In rural, deep red California, where last cycle a few hundred people showed up at such events, this turnout was historic. I heard from attendees who had never seen so many Democrats gather in their area before. While there was excitement and readiness to mobilize, people were also emotional and angry about how this administration is impacting their lives. And though they were upset with their own Republican members of Congress, they were also fed up with the Democrats in Washington who are failing to fight back against the cuts that will put their lives in danger.\n\nAcross the three town halls, the same questions kept coming up: What are Democrats going to do? What can I do? It’s critical that our party recognizes that people feel angry and want change.\n\nThere are five steps that we must take right now.\n\nFirst, we need to flip three Republican votes on the budget reconciliation bill GOP leaders are putting together in Congress. This legislation slashes funding to Medicaid and education. By sharing stories about the consequences of ripping away money for Medicaid and schools, we can embarrass Republican representatives to change their vote and put the well-being of their constituents over their loyalty to Trump.\n\nAs Republicans hide from voters, Democrats cannot remain passive and squander this moment.\n\nSecond, Democratic leaders should outline a clear organizing plan for 30 Republican-held districts that are competitive. This plan should include resources for potential volunteers, we should direct them to what they can do in these districts. This can mean hosting town halls, running phone banks, registering people to vote, knocking on doors and sharing stories on social media. Sen. Bernie Sanders, for example, is hiring full-time organizers in GOP representatives’ districts to get out the vote for local races.\n\nThird, we need an army of people in red districts distributing information. In Bakersfield, a woman at my town hall told me she has been delivering food to friends and neighbors in need while explaining how the Republicans and Trump are cutting SNAP and other benefits. Our party needs to recruit people and provide resources to spread information within communities about the harm Republicans are causing.\n\nFourth, we need candidates who can run in these districts at all levels of government. During the town halls, I met remarkable community leaders, parents and young people who are eager to get involved. Our party should make it a top priority to invest in candidates who decide to run for these seats.\n\nFinally, we need a vision that helps the working class and gives Americans hope for the future. At town halls and other local events, we must offer a plan for how we’re going to improve people’s lives when we take back the House. It should include specifics like a higher minimum wage, Medicare for All, $10-per-day childcare, 10 million new units of housing, and new tech and advanced manufacturing jobs to increase communities’ wealth and income.\n\nAs Republicans hide from voters, Democrats cannot remain passive and squander this moment. We must acknowledge voters’ fury, help them organize and offer concrete policies for a better country. That is how we build a movement, defeat the far-right and overcome the deep political nihilism in our country."

        "full_text": "Democratic Sen. Cory Booker mounted a historic protest on the Senate floor across two days, warning against the harms he said President Donald Trump’s administration is inflicting on the American public.\n\nThe New Jersey Democrat spoke for 25 hours and 5 minutes, according to his office, breaking the record for the longest floor speech in modern history of the chamber.\n\nBooker, 55, surpassed the late Sen. Strom Thurmond’s speech that lasted 24 hour and 18 minutes in 1957. Booker said that he was speaking “in spite” of the previous record holder’s remarks against the 1957 Civil Rights Act.\n\n“Since I’ve gotten to the Senate, I always felt it was a strange shadow hanging over this institution — that the longest speech, all the issues that have come up, all the noble causes that people have done, or the things that typically try to stop – I just found it strange that he had the record,” Booker told CNN. “And as a guy who grew up with the legends of the Civil Rights Movement, myself, my parents and their friends, it just would seem wrong to me. It always seemed wrong.”\n\nHe began his speech at 7 p.m. ET Monday with a vow to keep his protest going as long as he was “physically able” and with nothing, he told CNN, but a Bible verse in his pocket.\n\nThe marathon speaking session from Booker, a member of the Senate Democratic leadership team, comes as his party face increasing pressure from their voters to take a harder line against Trump. Locked out of power in Washington, Democrats have limited options and have struggled to find a unified strategy to counter the administration, but Booker’s speech stands out as one of the most high-profile forms of protest by a Democratic lawmaker so far in Trump’s second term.\n\nThe speech effectively delayed any legislative business in the Senate on Tuesday as it stretched late into the day, though it amounts to a primarily symbolic rebuke as Booker was not attempting to hold up any specific piece of legislation.\n\nBooker warned in his remarks that the “country is in crisis” as he railed against a wide-range of issues, from castigating Elon Musk’s efforts to overhaul the federal government under Trump to warning of potential cuts to key health care programs for millions of Americans.\n\n“I rise with the intention of disrupting the normal business of the United States Senate for as long as I am physically able,” Booker said at the outset of his remarks. “I rise tonight because I believe sincerely that our country is in crisis.”\n\n“In just 71 days, the president of the United States has inflicted so much harm on Americans’ safety; financial stability; the core foundations of our democracy,” Booker said. “These are not normal times in America. And they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate.”\n\nWhen he began his remarks Monday night, the New Jersey Democrat said that he was holding the floor in the spirit of the late John Lewis, a civil rights icon and longtime US congressman. In contrast, Thurmond set his record – which Booker has now overtaken – speaking against the 1957 Civil Rights Act.\n\nAs he approached the record, Booker spoke about his reverence for Lewis and became emotional when he said he had promised to make him proud as he neared the end of his life.\n\n“He wouldn’t treat this moral moment like it was normal,” Booker said of Lewis, asking, “Where does the Constitution live? On paper or in our hearts?”\n\nBooker, who has served in the Senate since 2013, is the first Black American to represent New Jersey in the Senate and is one of only five Black senators currently serving in the 100-member chamber.\n\nA number of Senate Democrats, including Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, joined him on the floor in a show of support for stretches of time. Booker never yielded the floor for a break as doing so would have allowed the presiding officer to move on with Senate business. The only time he was not speaking was when he briefly paused for the chamber’s prayer at noon on Tuesday and when he took questions at various points from Senate Democratic colleagues.\n\n“We should be stepping up and saying we accept a lot of responsibility for this moment, but we also have a lot of responsibility for meeting this moment. And so my staff and I have talked a lot about other things that we can do to contribute to the larger cause of our country right now,” Booker told CNN after he had concluded his speech.\n\nIn recent years, the chamber has seen a number of marathon speeches mounted by senators, including: Jeff Merkley against Neil Gorsuch in 2017; Sen. Chris Murphy on gun control in 2016; Rand Paul over National Security Agency surveillance programs in 2015; and Ted Cruz against the Affordable Care Act 2013.\n\nCruz, whose 2013 speech lasted 21 hours, said his advice for Booker was simply: “Wear comfortable shoes and don’t drink water.”\n\nBooker, for his part, said he had stopped eating and dehydrated himself in the days leading up to his speech, leading to muscle cramps and spasms as the hours wore on.\n\nThe speech was not a filibuster because Booker was not blocking legislation or a nomination, but it kept the Senate floor open – and floor staff and US Capitol Police detailed to the chamber working – for as long as he continued speaking. Lawmakers had concluded voting on Monday before Booker began speaking.\n\nBooker sounds warning on Trump policy\n\nBooker and his staff prepared 1,164 pages of material ahead of the speech, according to a person familiar with the matter, and the senator touched on a wide range of issues. At times, he appeared to grow emotional as he warned of the potential impact of Trump’s legislative agenda and policies.\n\nDuring his remarks, Booker raised alarm over the potential for cuts to Medicaid by congressional Republicans, describing the harm that would cause to his constituents and Americans across the country.\n\nRepublicans have insisted that they will not cut Medicaid, but have said they will go after waste, fraud and abuse and have proposed deep spending cuts – without specifying exactly what programs the cuts could come from – as part of their legislative agenda.\n\nAt one point, Booker invoked the late Sen. John McCain, reflecting on the Arizona Republican’s pivotal health care vote in 2017, and drawing parallels to this moment.\n\n“It is maddening in this country to create greater and greater health care crisis and for us not to solve it but to battle back and forth between trying to make incremental changes or to tear it all down with no plan to make it better, leaving more Americans suffering,” Booker said.\n\nLoudly raising his voice and speaking with emotion, Booker said, “Sen. McCain, I know you wouldn’t sanction this, I know you would be screaming, I’ve seen how angry you can get, John McCain. I’ve seen you tear people apart on this floor, Democrat and Republican, for doing the same stupid thing over and over again.”\n\n“Listen to John McCain explain why he voted ‘no’ the last time the Republican Party tried to unite and tear down health care with no idea how to fix it, threatening to put millions of Americans in financial crisis and health care crisis. I can’t believe we are here again.”\n\nDemocrats praise Booker’s effort\n\nBooker thanked each of his Democratic colleagues for their help as he continued speaking, repeatedly expressing his love for them. He noted that Murphy had stayed with him all night – a role reversal from when the Connecticut Democrat spoke for 14 hour and 52 minutes following the Pulse nightclub shooting in 2016 and Booker stuck by him.\n\n“I want to thank Sen. Murphy in particular because he’s been with me the whole night. He hasn’t left my side, and in some ways the debt is repaid,” Booker said, adding: “His debt is paid, but I’ve got fuel in the tank.”\n\nMurphy has seemingly smoothed out the process by discussing the effort with senators as they arrive on the floor and arranging speakers to ask Booker questions.\n\nAs Democrats step on to the floor, many have given Booker a thumbs-up or, as Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz did, a brief hug. During their questions, Booker has bounced from one foot to the other, shifting his weight as the hours of standing take their toll, and read notes passed to him by staff.\n\nBooker and Schumer briefly sparred over New York sports teams during their exchange, though they could agree that they both support the Giants.\n\nSchumer had been the first to pose a question to his New Jersey colleague, and he praised Booker for his “strength and conviction.”\n\n“You’re taking the floor tonight to bring up all these inequities that will hurt people, that will so hurt the middle class, that will so hurt poor people, that will hurt America, hurt our fiscal conditions, as you document,” the New York Democrat said. “Just give us a little inkling of the strength — give us a little feeling for the strength and conviction that drive you to do this unusual taking of the floor for a long time to let the people know how bad these things are going to be.”\n\nBooker then yielded to Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester for further questions, noting that before he began speaking, the Delaware Democrat prayed with him on the Senate floor.\n\nAt 7:19 pm ET on Tuesday, Schumer asked Booker to yield for a question, asking if he knew he had broken the record.\n\n“Do you know how proud this caucus is of you?” he then asked, as the full viewing galleries, House Democrats standing along the back of the chamber and Senate Democrats rose in a standing ovation.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments Tuesday.\n\nCNN’s Alison Main contributed to this report."

(Read more about PolitiFact's partnership with TikTok.)\n\nBut if you’re looking for debt relief, we have bad news for you. Submitting a complaint on the basis of a violation of the 1974 student privacy law won’t forgive your loans.\n\nThese posts began cropping up on Feb. 9, after The Washington Post reported on Feb. 4 that DOGE gained access to 16 Department of Education and Office of Personnel Management databases, including student loan databases containing more than 40 million borrowers’ personally identifying information.\n\nA federal judge in Maryland, on March 24, issued a preliminary injunction blocking DOGE from accessing people’s private data at the Education Department, the Treasury Department and the Office of Personnel Management and calling it a likely violation of federal privacy laws. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by the American Federation of Teachers and other labor unions against these federal agencies. The agencies have filed notice of their intent to appeal.\n\nThe University of California Student Association brought a separate but similar case against the Education Department; it is pending in a D.C. federal court.\n\nThese TikTok posts sharing template language for people to use to file Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act violation complaints to get their debts canceled are off-base. That’s because there’s no legal path for loan forgiveness through that law.\n\nIn 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Gonzaga v. Doe that although the Education Department can sue schools on the basis of violations of the 1974 law, individual people can’t.\n\nThe law applies to all educational institutions that receive federal funding. If the Education Department finds any school violating it, the department may withhold funding from the institution. Law violations extend to personal information collected as a result of educational data collection, such as grades, disciplinary records, and personally identifiable information. But it does not provide individual students with a direct legal course of action against their schools, nor does the law have any relationship to the federal loan process overseen by the Education Department, said LeRoy Rooker, former director of the Education Department’s Family Policy Compliance Office and an expert on this law.\n\n\"I'm not sure what you even have to go on here that would be any basis for filing a complaint,\" Rooker told PolitiFact. \"FERPA is protecting student privacy rights, giving students access to records, protecting the privacy of them, that sort of thing. And student loans are student loans. You have a legal obligation for repaying those, and a FERPA violation would have no relation.\"\n\nWe rate the claim that you can have your student loans forgiven by completing a 1974 student privacy law violation complaint False."

        "full_text": "The price of gold soared to an all-time high of $3,150.52 per ounce on Tuesday morning, as investors braced for potential economic fallout from U.S. President Donald Trump's unleashing of sweeping new tariffs, set to be unveiled on April 2.\n\nGold, a safe-haven asset long regarded as a hedge against financial uncertainty, saw increased demand as markets reacted to Trump's plan to impose \"reciprocal\" tariffs on all trade partners. He sees current trading terms as broadly unfair to the U.S.\n\nTrump's planned tariffs could affect hundreds of billions in trade flows, rekindling fears of the kind of global slowdown seen during the U.S.-China trade war during his first term.\n\nAmerican consumers and businesses may also find themselves facing higher prices because import costs have increased substantially due to the new duties.\n\nThough Trump is delivering on his campaign promise of tariffs, which he argues will protect American businesses and draw more investment into the U.S., the economic risks threaten to stoke voter resentment and derail his presidency.\n\nThe president has dubbed April 2 \"Liberation Day,\" hinting at a broad reshaping of U.S. trade relationships. But investors fear a damaging trade war that will push the global economy into recession.\n\n\"Uncertainty is one of the main factors that has led to a renewed interest in gold,\" Krishan Gopaul, senior analyst at the World Gold Council, told the Financial Times. \"There is a general risk-off sentiment in the market at the moment.\"\n\nStock markets have taken a pounding and Trump's economic approval rating continues to slide as recession anxieties grow. Golman Sachs raised the odds of a recession from 20 percent to 35 percent, Reuters reported.\n\nU.S. Senator Tim Sheehy, a Republican from Montana, told CNN there's \"absolutely going to be short-term pain\" when Trump introduces tariffs.\n\n\"The president's been clear about that. Everyone has. If you're going to remodel your house to make it better in the end, it's going to be really annoying in the short-term when your house is getting remodeled,\" Sheehy said.\n\n\"The reality is, that remodel has got to happen in order to make things stronger and more stable in the back end. We've had generations now of countries taking advantage of the strong American economy, the strong American workforce.\"\n\nNeil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note that conflicting reports about what Trump's plans are for tariffs meant it's \"anyone's guess\" as to what will happen.\n\nBut he said tariffs \"will have clear—and clearly negative—economic consequences. \"Although Trump continues to insist that tariffs are a tax on U.S. trading partners, it is American importers who must foot the bill, with the costs typically passed on to consumers.\"\n\nShearing added: \"Tariff wars have no real winners—only mounting costs and unintended consequences.\"\n\nApril 2 is the big day. Trump will reveal his tariff plans to the world."

        "full_text": "New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker broke a record Tuesday evening, speaking for more than 24 hours in a marathon speech protesting the national \"crisis\" he said President Donald Trump and Elon Musk had created.\n\nBooker's speech, which began Monday evening, continued for a total of 25 hours and 4 minutes, surpassing the previous record set by Sen. Strom Thurmond, who filibustered the Civil Rights Act of 1957 for 24 hours and 18 minutes.\n\nShortly before he broke Thurmond's record, as the Senate gallery above the chamber began filling with onlookers and staffers who had gathered to witness the historic event, Booker spoke about his relationship with Georgia Rep. John Lewis, the longtime lawmaker and icon of the civil rights movement who died in 2020.\n\n\"John Lewis would say something; he would do something,\" Booker said in an impassioned voice that was beginning to show signs of strain. \"He wouldn't treat this moral moment as if it were normal.\"\n\nHe added, \"This is our moral moment. This is when the most precious ideas of our country are being tested.\"\n\nAt approximately 7:20 p.m. Tuesday, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer briefly interrupted Booker to inform him he had broken the record.\n\n\"Do you know how proud this caucus is of you? Do you know how proud America is of you?\" Schumer asked.\n\nThe chamber erupted in applause. Booker did not immediately end his speech, but continued speaking.\n\n\"From all Americans, this is a moral moment. It's not left or right -- it's right or wrong,\" Booker said after continuing his speech and touching on everything from cuts to federal programs initiated by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to the controversy surrounding Trump administration officials' use of the Signal messaging app.\n\nBooker wrapped up his speech and finally yielded the floor to another enthusiastic round of applause at 8:05 p.m. ET.\n\nAt the beginning of the marathon speech on Monday evening, Booker said he rose \"with the intention of disrupting the normal business\" of the chamber because he said he believes the country is in \"crisis\" due to the actions of the White House since Trump started his second term.\n\n\"I rise tonight because I believe sincerely that our country is in crisis, and I believe that not in a partisan sense, because so many of the people that have been reaching out to my office in pain, in fear, having their lives upended -- so many of them identify themselves as Republicans,\" Booker said.\n\n\"In just 71 days, the president of the United States has inflicted so much harm on Americans' safety, financial stability, the core foundations of our democracy and even our aspirations as a people [for] our highest offices, a sense of common decency,\" Booker said. \"These are not normal times in America. And they should not be treated as such.\"\n\nOver 24 hours hour, Booker's comments addressed a wide range of topics, including the Russia-Ukraine war, USAID relief in foreign countries, concerns about cuts to Medicaid and slashes to Social Security offices, among other issues.\n\nIn addition to Thurmond's civil rights era filibuster, Booker's also bested two more recent marathon Senate floor talks. In 2013, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz spoke for 21 hours advocating for the defunding of Obamacare and, in 2016, Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy spoke for 15 hours pressing for action on gun violence.\n\nFor the entirety of his marathon talk-a-thon, Booker occupied the small square of space surrounding his desk.\n\nOnce the speech began, he did not sit down. He did not eat. On his desk, two glasses of water had been refilled at various points. On occasion, he leaned on the lectern, wiped his face with a handkerchief. But by the time the record was broken, Booker, who was wearing a black suit, had still not loosened his tie.\n\n\"I've got fuel in the tank man,\" Booker said during the 15-hour mark on Tuesday morning.\n\nHe also read aloud letters that he said were from constituents and quoted speeches from figures such as the late Sen. John Lewis, who famously advocated for \"good trouble\" in the fight for justice and equality.\n\nAs long Booker held the floor, the Senate has not been able to conduct other business unless he temporarily yields.\n\nHe has been joined by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic Sens. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Andy Kim of New Jersey, Peter Welch of Vermont, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Chris Coons of Delaware, Mark Warner of Virginia, Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and some others.\n\nBooker has entertained questions from the lawmakers, allowing him short breaks in speaking, but he's been careful to note that he's \"retaining the floor\" so as not to break his continuous hold according to Senate procedural rules. He's had to remain standing during these \"question\" periods."

        "full_text": "Just when you thought Democrats couldn't outclass themselves after Rep. Jasmine Crockett referred to Texas Gov. Abbott as \"hot wheels\", here comes California to make sure you're always entertained.\n\nA new California ballot initiative, named after alleged UnitedHealthcare CEO killer Luigi Mangione, has been filed with the state Attorney General. It seeks to ban insurers from delaying, denying, or altering any doctor-recommended treatment that could risk serious harm, including death or permanent injury, according to KTLA.\n\nIf passed, the initiative would require that only physicians—not insurance company staff—can decide to delay, deny, or alter medical treatments. Hiring non-physicians for such reviews would become a felony.\n\nInsurers would bear a high burden of proof if they delay care, needing clear and convincing evidence the treatment was unnecessary or wouldn’t prevent serious harm. Patients could sue for treble damages and attorney fees.\n\nKTLA writes that the measure is under review, with public comments open until April 25. The Attorney General will finalize its title before signature gathering begins.\n\nRecall, Luigi Mangione, a 26-year-old from Towson, Maryland, is accused of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December 2024.\n\nA University of Pennsylvania graduate, Mangione was apprehended in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and faces multiple charges, including first-degree murder and terrorism-related offenses."

        "full_text": "I was talking recently to a friend who’s a professor at Columbia University about what’s been happening there. He had a lot to say.\n\nWhen he needed to run off to an appointment, I asked him if he’d text or email me the rest of his thoughts.\n\nHis response worried me. “No,” he said. “I better not. They may be reviewing it.”\n\n“Who’s ‘they’?” I asked.\n\n“They! The university. The government. Gotta go!” He was off.\n\nMy friend has never shown signs of paranoia.\n\nI relay this to you because the Donald Trump regime is starting to have a chilling effect on what and how Americans communicate with each other. It is beginning to deter open dissent, which is exactly what the US president intends.\n\nThe chill affects all five major pillars of civil society – universities, science, the media, the law and the arts.\n\nIn Columbia University’s capitulation to Trump, it agreed to require demonstrators to identify themselves when asked and put its department of Middle Eastern studies under “receivership”, lest it lose $400m in government funding.\n\nThe agreement is already chilling dissent there, as my conversation with my friend revealed.\n\nThe Trump regime also “detained” a Columbia University graduate student and green card holder who participated in protests at the school. The administration’s agents have also entered dorms with search warrants and targeted two other students who participated in such protests.\n\nOn Tuesday, an international student in a graduate program at Tufts University was taken into custody outside her off-campus apartment building by plainclothes homeland security agents, handcuffed and whisked away to a prison in Louisiana. She has a valid student visa. Her apparent offense? Putting her name to an opinion piece in the Tufts student newspaper that was critical of how the Tufts administration handled protests.\n\nScores of other major universities are on Trump’s target list.\n\nTrump’s attack on science has involved threats to three of the largest funders of American science – the Centers for Disease Control, National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation.\n\nTens of thousands of researchers are worried about how to continue their research. Many have decided to hunker down and not criticize the Trump administration for fear of losing their funding.\n\nPhilippe Baptiste, the French minister for higher education, has charged that a French scientist traveling to a conference near Houston earlier this month was denied entry into the US because his phone contained message exchanges with colleagues and friends in which he gave a negative “personal opinion” about Trump’s scientific and research policies. The US Department of Homeland Security denies this was the reason the scientist wasn’t admitted into the country.\n\nMeanwhile, America’s major media fear more lawsuits from Trump and his political allies in the wake of ABC’s surrender to Trump in December, agreeing to pay him $15m to settle a defamation suit he filed against the network.\n\nJournalists who cover the White House are reeling from Trump’s decision to bar those he deems unfriendly from major events where space is limited.\n\nThe media chill is palpable. Jeff Bezos, the owner of the Washington Post, has openly restricted the kinds of op-eds appearing in its editorial pages.\n\nThe latest example of Trump’s use of executive orders to target powerful law firms that have challenged him came on Tuesday, against Jenner & Block.\n\nThe firm employed the attorney Andrew Weissmann after he worked as a prosecutor in the special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Trump during his first term.\n\nThe White House charged that the firm “participated in the weaponization of the legal system against American principles and values”, and an official specifically called out Weissmann.\n\nLast month, Trump removed the security clearances of lawyers at Covington & Burling who represented the former special counsel Jack Smith following his investigation of Trump’s role in the January 6 Capitol attack.\n\nTrump has also targeted Perkins Coie, a firm linked to opposition research against Trump in 2016. His order banned Perkins Coie lawyers from federal buildings and halted its federal contracts.\n\nAnother executive order took aim at Paul Weiss, who employed the lawyer Mark Pomerantz before he helped prosecute Trump over hush money payments to Stormy Daniels.\n\nLast Thursday, Trump withdrew the executive order against Paul Weiss because, he said, the firm had “acknowledged the wrongdoing” of Pomerantz and pledged $40m in free legal work to support the Trump administration.\n\nNon-profits tell the Washington Post that law firms that once might have helped them fight Trump’s orders now fear Trump will pursue them if they do.\n\nTrump is even intimidating the arts by taking over the Kennedy Center, firing board members, ousting its president and making himself chairman.\n\nThe comedian Nikki Glaser, one of the few celebrities to walk the red carpet at this year’s Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prizes, now thinks twice before doing political jokes directed at Trump.\n\n“Like, you just are scared that you’re gonna get doxxed and death threats or who knows where this leads, like, detained. Honestly, that’s not even like a joke. It’s like a real fear,” she told Deadline.\n\nEvery tyrant in history has sought to stifle criticism of himself and his regime.\n\nBut America was founded on criticism. American democracy was built on dissent. We conducted a revolution against tyranny.\n\nThis moment calls for courage and collective action rather than capitulation – resolve by universities, researchers, journalists, the legal community, and the arts to stand up to Trump.\n\nAnyone holding responsible positions in these five pillars of civil society must reject Trump’s attempts at intimidation and condemn what he is trying to do.\n\nThose who surrender to Trump’s tyranny invite more of it."

        "full_text": "A $90m litmus test - Wisconsin court vote becomes referendum on Musk\n\n1 day ago\n\nNomia Iqbal and Cai Pigliucci\n\nBBC News\n\nReporting from Milwaukee, Wisconsin\n\nIt's only been five months since voters in Wisconsin faced a bitterly fought election, but residents of the US state are already heading back to the polls.\n\nThis time, Elon Musk looms large in the race to fill a vacancy on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, even if the billionaire's name doesn't appear on the ballot.\n\nIt's the most expensive judicial contest in US history, with more than $90m (£70m) spent so far, including $20m from Musk and groups affiliated with him.\n\nThe choice is between conservative Brad Schimel, backed by President Donald Trump and Musk, and liberal Susan Crawford, who is supported by former President Barack Obama and Democratic mega-donors like George Soros.\n\nIt's forecast to be a tight contest that could flip control of the Midwestern state's top court, which is currently controlled 4-3 by liberal justices.\n\nBut it's also one of the first real tests of voter sentiment towards Trump, in a state that he won by less than a percentage point during his decisive White House election victory last November.\n\nThe Republican president's second administration has slashed federal programmes - cuts that have been shepherded by Musk, the world's richest man and a close Trump ally.\n\n\"This really matters,\" said canvasser Ronneisha Mallet. \"People aren't looking at the bigger picture. People just think this is just a local election. But it goes all the way to the White House.\"\n\nThe 23-year-old was out knocking doors in a quiet residential area on the outskirts of Milwaukee on Monday, a day before voters were set to cast their ballots.\n\nShe was here with Bloc - Black Leaders Organising for Communities - encouraging people to vote.\n\nThese kinds of special elections typically see low voter turnout. But Musk's involvement has supercharged emotions on all sides.\n\nGroups like Bloc put in extra time to engage with voters.\n\nNot everyone opened their front door on Monday, but some of those who did told Ms Mallet they had already voted. By Monday, some 644,000 people had cast ballots early, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission.\n\n\"I hate Musk! I hate his guts!\" Peggy, standing at her door, said. She didn't want to give the BBC her full name, but described herself as an independent voter who has soured on the Republican Party.\n\n\"I think Musk bought the presidency,\" she said, in reference to the quarter-of-a-billion dollars that Musk spent in support of Trump's presidential campaign.\n\n\"And so I think he's trying to buy the election here,\" Peggy continued. \"And I am hoping that people are starting to wake up.\"\n\nDemocrats, too, have rallied deep-pocketed donors in support of Crawford. Along with Soros, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman have reportedly contributed large sums. But their names haven't inspired the same vitriol as Musk's.\n\nAnother resident - who gave his name as Palman - said he had already voted, in part as a reaction to Musk.\n\n\"When you're a billionaire, you don't spend money for no reason,\" he said. \"He's just spending it with purpose.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Musk hosted a rally where he handed out two $1m cheques to voters who had signed a petition to stop \"activist\" judges who might disrupt Trump's plans.\n\nWe drove about a half-hour outside of Milwaukee to Waukesha - a swing county that President Trump won. Around 100 people were gathered at the Dockhaus brewery and restaurant overlooking a baseball park, where Schimel made a campaign stop.\n\nConor Gunar was wearing a red shirt with Musk's name on it.\n\n\"I'm a big fan,\" he said, clutching his beer. \"He is doing a fantastic job with Doge.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" he added when asked about Musk's involvement in the race. \"Democrats have people like George Soros and JB Pritzker; why can't we have billionaires?\"\n\nAnother Schimel supporter, Scarlett Johnson, agreed.\n\nShe was at Musk's town hall-style event over the weekend, which she described as \"great fun\".\n\nBut she said she also understood the criticism.\n\n\"Look, I think it would be great if no billionaires were involved at all, but if they're going to be as they have for Democrats, it's only fair they're involved for Republicans.\"\n\nOn the left, strategists see a glimmer of light as they search for a clear political strategy.\n\nDrive down the roads, and you can see billboards plastered in cities like Green Bay and Madison that read \"don't let Elon buy our court\" and depict the SpaceX and Tesla boss as a puppeteer.\n\nSwitch on the TV and you'll see attack ads that say: \"Elon Musk is out of control.\"\n\nGoing after Musk instead of Trump seems to be a strategic option for Democrats.\n\nA poll by Marquette Law School suggests Musk is viewed unfavorably by 53% of registered voters here.\n\nDriving in his car across rural Wisconsin, Ben Wickler, chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, told the BBC that if Crawford could beat Schimel, \"there'll be a very clear kind of game plan for how to fight back against the world's richest man trying to destroy American democracy\".\n\nAllison Prasch, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who specialises in US political rhetoric, said this race was a strategy test for both sides.\n\n\"We know that Wisconsin, up to the very end of the presidential cycle, was very close,\" she said, noting that some cities such as Milwaukee and Madison unexpectedly swung towards Trump and helped deliver him the state's electoral college votes.\n\n\"What happens in Wisconsin [now] is going to tell us a lot about what's going to happen, not just in 2026 but in 2028.\"\n\nMusk's critics say he has practical reasons to care about the Wisconsin race.\n\nThey point to an ongoing case involving Tesla, Musk's electric vehicle company, that could head to the state's supreme court in the future.\n\nThe billionaire is suing because Wisconsin bans car manufacturers from owning dealerships, but Tesla's business model involves running its own showrooms.\n\nThe BBC has contacted Musk's America PAC for comment.\n\nWisconsin Republican strategist Matt Terrill said Musk was allowed to donate to campaigns for things he personally cared about, like any other citizen might - including the Democratic donors heavily backing Crawford.\n\n\"Musk has obviously got his views from a political standpoint of what he as an American citizen wants to see happen, not just as someone who's a part of the Trump administration,\" said Terrill.\n\nThe result won't just be a referendum on Trump's presidency so far, but will test Musk's reputation as a kingmaker in American politics."

Darrell Issa, R-Calif., discusses the expected House hearing on district court Judge Brian Boasberg, who has ruled against President Donald Trump’s deportation flights on ‘Fox News Live.’\n\nHouse Republicans are going all out this week to signal their support for the Trump administration amid multiple legal standoffs over White House policy.\n\nA bill to limit U.S. district court judges’ ability to issue nationwide injunctions sailed through the House Rules Committee – the last gatekeeper for bills before a chamber-wide vote – in a party-line vote Monday evening, as expected.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, meanwhile, two high-profile panels on the House Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing at 10 a.m. ET on \"judicial overreach and constitutional limits on the federal courts.\"\n\n\"Clearly, our members are as angered as President Trump about some of these rogue judges,\" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., the No. 2 House Republican, told Fox News Digital in a brief interview. \"So we're doing a number of things.\"\n\nWHO IS JAMES BOASBERG, THE US JUDGE AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S DEPORTATION EFFORTS?\n\nPresident Donald Trump is getting backup in his standoff with the courts from House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan and other House Republicans. (Getty Images)\n\nThe hearing will be held by the House Judiciary Committee’s subcommittee on the Constitution, led by Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and its subcommittee on courts, led by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif.\n\nNotably, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., is expected to testify, as is a woman described as a victim of criminal activity perpetrated by the terrorist organization Tren de Aragua in Aurora, Colorado.\n\nHer appearance is likely linked to the ongoing legal showdown between the Trump administration and U.S. District Judge James Boasberg after he issued an emergency 14-day pause on the White House’s deportation flights of suspected Tren de Aragua gang members to El Salvador.\n\n\"We share the president's concern that you've got some judges that have overstepped their boundaries,\" Scalise said. \"I mean, you have a plane flying with hardened criminals ... and Judge Boasberg orders the plane to turn around in mid-flight … and bring hardened criminals back to America who were already here illegally. That's clearly judicial activism and a judge trying to become the executive. That's not his role.\"\n\nIssa is also spearheading the No Rogue Rulings Act (NORRA Act) to get a House-wide vote this week, which would limit the ability of Boasberg and other district court judges from issuing rulings that affect Trump policies across the country, beyond their direct jurisdiction.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise spoke with Fox News Digital about GOP plans. (REUTERS/Mike Segar)\n\nThat legislation is likely to pass with little if any Republican dissent. Two people familiar with discussions told Fox News Digital this month that Capitol Hill aides were told Trump \"likes\" the bill.\n\nHouse Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., the No. 3 House Republican, also made clear leadership is united behind this week’s strategy.\n\n\"Judges cannot act as pseudo-legislators to advance their political agenda; that’s not how our government works,\" Emmer told Fox News Digital exclusively in a written statement. \"I’m grateful for Chairman Jordan and Congressman Issa’s leadership in House Republicans’ efforts to ensure impartiality on the bench.\"\n\n'WOEFULLY INSUFFICIENT': US JUDGE REAMS TRUMP ADMIN FOR DAYS-LATE DEPORTATION INFO\n\nBut it’s clear there’s an appetite among Republican judiciary hawks and conservatives to go further.\n\nScalise would not go into specifics but vowed, \"Everything's being looked at, and all options are on the table.\"\n\nDemocrats are vowing to push back, with Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, accusing Trump of using judges as \"scapegoats\" for his policy setbacks.\n\n\"This week's efforts to distract from Trump’s serial violations of the Spending Clause, the separation of powers, the Birthright Citizenship Clause, Equal Protection, the First Amendment freedom of speech, Fifth Amendment Due Process and Sixth Amendment right to counsel will include a House hearing made for Trump’s viewing pleasure and a vote on a Republican bill to ban nationwide injunctions,\" Raskin told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"As my colleagues embark on this embarrassing diversion, Judiciary Democrats will remind them at every turn: it's not the courts' fault that Trump keeps losing these cases. No amount of finger pointing will shift responsibility from this rogue president who keeps deliberately trashing the Constitution and violating the rights and freedoms of the people of the United States.\"\n\nThere have been over a dozen injunctions levied against various Trump policies across the country, from birthright citizenship reform to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nJudge Boasberg is currently in a legal standoff with the Trump administration. (Getty)\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., met privately with Republican judiciary committee members last week for what sources called a \"brainstorming\" session.\n\nIdeas raised by lawmakers included a fast-tracked appeals process, wielding Congress’ spending power over the judiciary, and limiting the ability to \"judge shop.\"\n\nAnd some conservatives are eager to target specific judges they believe are abusing their power via the impeachment process, but House Republican leaders are wary of that route and believe it to be less effective than other legislative avenues.\n\nConservatives could still force Johnson’s hand by filing a \"privileged\" impeachment resolution, meaning the House would have to at least hold a procedural vote on the measure within two legislative days.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News Digital is not aware of any current plans to do so, and Johnson assured Republicans at their closed-door meeting last week that he was in contact with the White House every step of the way.\n\nTrump’s GOP Senate allies are rolling out their own strategy to push back on activist judges in the coming days, with the Senate Judiciary Committee teeing up a similar hearing to the House’s Tuesday event.\n\nElizabeth Elkind is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital leading coverage of the House of Representatives.

        "original_source": "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/opinion/trump-executive-orders-presidential-power.html",
        "full_text": "We’ve gotten used to seeing a president’s first 100 days as a gauge of progress and a benchmark for history. (Thanks, Franklin Roosevelt.) To understand the early days of President Trump’s second term, however, when so much has happened so quickly, there is an alternative milestone to consider.\n\nLast week, with more than a month to go before he will reach 100 days in office, Trump surpassed 100 executive orders. Reading through them all lays bare the assumptions, obsessions and contradictions of the man signing them.\n\nThe executive order is Trump’s preferred governing tool. Even with Republican congressional majorities, he favors the flourish of the order over the hassle of lawmaking. Why bother assembling legislative coalitions when you can just write, “By the authority vested in me as president by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered” and then tack on whatever you like?\n\nThere’s a tension inherent in executive orders as an exercise of presidential power. For all their “because I say so” affectations, orders do not carry the same legitimacy or endurance of laws passed by Congress and can be revoked by future presidents. (Some of Trump’s second-term executive orders simply undo some of President Joe Biden’s orders, which in turn rescinded orders from the first Trump term.) Still, these documents can prove enormously consequential, and some represent indelible moments, for good or ill, in American history. The Emancipation Proclamation, the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II and the postwar desegregation of the U.S. military all came about via executive order.\n\nIn keeping with this administration’s management style, Trump’s first 107 orders, spanning some 300 pages, can be a bit of a mess. Some are specific in their instructions — whether setting tariff rates for certain countries or permitting only two possible sexes on government documents — and they fulfill promises Trump made before taking office. Many others list no precise actions but only instruct some new task force or council to think of things to do. An agency or program may receive new responsibilities in one executive order only to find itself dismantled in another. Orders sometimes echo Trump’s standard slogans, whether putting America first or making America great, without adding much meaning to them. And stylistically, they veer from formal policy pronouncement to campaign speech to social media diatribe, sometimes all within the same text.\n\nYet despite the muddle — or perhaps because of it — the new administration’s orders fulfill one essential service: They affirm and expand Trump’s vision of the presidency, of politics, of our Nation. (Yes, “nation” is invariably capitalized.) The orders capture the world as Trump sees it and wishes it to be, and they show how the borders between high principle and low politics, between words and reality, are porous.\n\nAmerica was great until Biden ruined it. The economy is shackled by misguided regulations and must be set free. Trump’s opponents are ideological, while he relies on common sense. American values are always in danger and must be shielded from enemies, often enemies from within. The president is not just the head of the executive branch but also the sole interpreter of law and the lone representative of the people.\n\nFor a leader so comfortable in the mayhem of social media, the executive order, with all its trappings of officialdom, is an oddly retro format. But it’s a revealing one. What Twitter was for Trump’s first term, the Federal Register may be for his second.\n\nAt a basic level, Trump’s executive orders clarify his priorities.\n\nTwo of the most frequently recurring subjects are the economy (especially energy, regulation and trade) and immigration and border issues; together those account for some 40 percent of the orders. About one in seven takes aim at the civil service, with several orders empowering Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (though the man himself goes unmentioned). Roughly 10 percent of the orders deal with foreign policy, especially the evils of international agreements and global bodies such as the World Health Organization. Only a handful of orders primarily address diversity, equity and inclusion programs, yet the administration’s anti-D.E.I. energy permeates many more. About one out of every eight orders engages in various culture-war battles, from abortion to gun rights to religion, and several others indulge in retribution against perceived political opponents.\n\nSo, as a breakdown of Trump’s fixations, the orders are not a bad proxy.\n\nThe verbs in Trump’s executive orders are telling. “Unleashing” is a constant activity, even appearing in some of the titles. The economy must be unleashed; the potential of private citizens must be unleashed; energy resources must be unleashed. “Unleashing” gives way to “restoring,” whether of prosperity, common sense or freedom of speech. (The death penalty, a Trump preoccupation for decades, also requires restoring, as do names, like “Mount McKinley,” that honor American greatness.) Finally, there is much “protecting” and “defending” in Trump’s orders — protecting citizens against immigrant invaders, defending women against gender ideology, protecting the “priceless and profound gift” of U.S. citizenship from the children of illegal immigrants, and defending religious liberty through a new White House Faith Office.\n\nThese verbs tell us how Trump sees the country. Only an inhibited America would need unleashing; only a neglected America would need restoring; only a vulnerable America would need protecting. No wonder that Trump has immediately declared several simultaneous national emergencies, involving energy supplies, the border, criminal cartels and even the International Criminal Court. And the man Trump blames for this deteriorated state of our union is Biden, who in recent years subbed in for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama as Trump’s nemesis of choice.\n\nThroughout his executive orders, Trump trashes his immediate predecessor in the White House for pushing radical climate policies, trampling free speech, embedding D.E.I. throughout the federal government, limiting energy production, encouraging an immigrant invasion, commuting the sentences of death-row inmates and, above all, deploying federal power against political enemies.\n\nThat last point is the subject of Trump’s first executive order, E.O. 14147, and it carries on where his campaign left off. “The American people have witnessed the previous administration engage in a systematic campaign against its perceived political opponents, weaponizing the legal force of numerous federal law enforcement agencies and the intelligence community.” Such actions, his order asserts, were not about the legitimate pursuit of justice but about “inflicting political pain.”\n\nThe irony of this order, titled Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government, is that in several subsequent orders Trump commands his own administration to engage in such weaponization. Trump repeatedly attacks major law firms that have worked with Democratic clients or that have ties to prior investigations against Trump, suspending their security clearances and terminating any government contracts. He also calls on the attorney general and the director of national intelligence to review or investigate various actions by the Biden administration, which he accuses of behavior that is not just “shortsighted” but also “illegal and immoral.”\n\nThe former president’s offense, as expressed in the orders, isn’t just that he weaponized government against Trump; it’s that Biden’s failures undercut American greatness. In many orders Trump first extols our nation’s virtues and riches and then chastises the Biden administration for diminishing and misusing them.\n\n“America is blessed with an abundance of energy and natural resources that have historically powered our nation’s economic prosperity,” reads a typical order, titled Unleashing American Energy. However, it continues, “in recent years, burdensome and ideologically motivated regulations have impeded the development of these resources,” leading to high energy costs that “devastate American consumers.” The order goes on to eliminate Biden-era policies promoting electric vehicles and revokes a dozen Biden executive orders involving energy, climate and the environment. Just about everything that is wrong with America is Biden’s fault.\n\nNote the phrasing of the criticism: “ideologically motivated regulations.” This is a default assumption in Trump’s orders: Whatever his opponents do is driven by some hopelessly doctrinaire belief system, whereas Trump follows logic and common sense. One Trump executive order cites “serious concerns of political bias” in the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and another is devoted to “eradicating anti-Christian bias” in the public square. Schools are imprinting “false ideologies” on America’s children, another order states, and immigrants who “espouse hateful ideology” must be vetted and removed from the country. And the Biden administration advanced a “corrosive ideology” of systemic racism that makes citizens feel ashamed of their country.\n\nAll manner of blinders and biases can take root in our politics and our citizenry; that’s human nature. And the Democratic Party certainly gravitated toward progressive stances on issues of race, sexuality and identity over the past decade, whether out of heartfelt conviction, activist pressure or political expediency. But the corollary assumption — that Trump’s preferences are pure and nonideological, the stuff of simple fact and homespun wisdom — is belied by his own orders.\n\nTo decree, as one Trump order does, that for every new federal regulation that is created, 10 old ones must be eliminated, is to stake out an ideological position in the debates over the proper reach of government. It may be good policy or bad policy, but it is not in any sense politically neutral or intellectually self-evident. (The order does not say where that ratio comes from, except to say that it is “important,” and a fact sheet the White House issued to explain the order doesn’t help much, either.) To order that for every four federal workers who are fired only one new worker may be hired is similarly not a value-free proposition, no matter if the order is sanitized as a Workforce Optimization Initiative.\n\nOn some occasions, the president calls for studies to ascertain the facts of an issue, even though the text of the order already indicates Trump’s preordained conclusion. When he instructs the commerce secretary to assess whether lumber and timber imports threaten U.S. national security, he does so in an order titled Addressing the Threat to National Security From Imports of Timber, Lumber. And anyone who recalls the evisceration of the U.S. Agency for International Development in February may be surprised to learn that Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order Re-evaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid mandated a 90-day pause in U.S. aid flows to assess their “programmatic efficiencies and consistency with United States foreign policy.” By early February, however, Musk was already bragging that he’d spent a weekend “feeding USAID into the wood chipper.”\n\nFor the record, the 90-day pause ends April 20. Can’t wait to see how the aid review turns out.\n\nNot only does the Trump administration dismantle agencies and programs on ideological grounds before thorough assessments are conducted, but Trump still assigns them additional duties. In an order signed Jan. 29, the president instructed the secretary of education to spend up to four months building a commission in the department to focus on patriotic schooling; in an order signed March 20, Trump told the secretary to just close the Department of Education. In a Feb. 7 order titled Addressing Egregious Actions of the Republic of South Africa, Trump determined that Afrikaner farmers were suffering racial discrimination from their government and should receive priority for entry and resettlement through the United States Refugee Admission Program. Just one wrinkle: In an order signed two weeks earlier, Trump suspended the refugee program altogether, arguing that admission of more refugees “would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.”\n\nTrump did offer a loophole: Only those refugees “who can fully and appropriately assimilate into the United States” should be admitted or those whose presence is deemed “in the national interest.” His later order designating white South African farmers as worthy of admission says a lot about who he thinks can assimilate into America and serve the interests of our nation.\n\nMany of Trump’s executive orders illuminate the president’s interpretation of America’s values — what kind of people belong here, how the nation’s history should be taught, which principles are worth upholding and defending.\n\nOn this point, some of the orders are so generic as to be meaningless. One of the shortest declares that U.S. foreign policy must always “put America and American citizens first” and that the secretary of state must make sure all policies, programs and staff members align with that goal. In another, Trump requires that taxpayer money should be spent “only on making America great.” It’s hard to know how to execute such orders, other than to proclaim them.\n\nIn an executive order creating a council of advisers on science and technology, Trump points to Thomas Edison, the Wright brothers and Neil Armstrong to show that “the American story is one of boundless creativity and bold ambition, driven by an indomitable pioneering spirit.” He extols the “potential” of the American citizen and the nation’s economy, potential that can be encouraged — or, yes, unleashed — with proper policies and attitudes.\n\nBut throughout his orders, the president also betrays defensiveness about American values, often defining them by what they are against, by who threatens them. Immigrants, for example, are a constant danger to the American experiment. For all their emphasis on the country’s potential, Trump’s orders typically depict new arrivals as malicious people who might display “hostile attitudes” toward America’s government, citizens and culture or even be “potential terrorists.” It is a stark juxtaposition — a nation so enamored of its own potential that nonetheless insists on treating those who wish to join it as potentially destructive.\n\nTrump wants our schools to offer an “accurate, honest, unifying, inspiring and ennobling characterization of America’s founding.” It’s an understandable impulse, yet it ignores how an honest accounting of that era — or, really, of any other — inevitably reveals episodes that are far from noble or inspirational. Such episodes don’t make the American story wrong; they make it real.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump compared America’s instincts with those of Vladimir Putin’s Russia, asking, “What, you think our country’s so innocent?” Now, however, Trump revels in that sense of innocence and wishes to eliminate anything casting America’s past in a negative light. In an order titled Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History, the president decries efforts to “rewrite our nation’s history” with “divisive narratives” of racial or sexual injustice. The only “objective facts” permitted are those that celebrate the country’s “remarkable achievements” and “extraordinary heritage” and “unmatched record of advancing liberty.” It is a static vision of history, no less dogmatic or ideological than the interpretations he so roundly rejects.\n\nThere is much talk of America’s founding documents in Trump’s executive orders, including the president’s desire to salute the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence next year in grand style. In an order on how the U.S. military should uphold American values, he directs the service academies to teach that the United States and its founding documents “remain the most powerful force for good in human history.”\n\nTrump’s attitude toward those documents is more revealing the more detailed he becomes. In an order on changing the hiring process for civil servants, he stresses that the federal government must attract employees who are “committed to achieving the freedom, prosperity and democratic rule that our Constitution promotes.” He also affirms that people should not be hired if they are “unwilling to defend the Constitution or to faithfully serve the executive branch.”\n\nBut what happens when defense of the Constitution and fidelity to the executive come into conflict? In a later order, titled Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies, Trump provides his answer.\n\n“The Constitution vests all executive power in the president and charges him with faithfully executing the laws,” the order begins. It goes on to criticize independent regulatory agencies for operating “without sufficient accountability to the president, and through him, to the American people.” The implication is that only the president — and not, say, the people’s elected representatives in Congress — embodies the popular will, and that this unmediated relationship with the people grants him unprecedented power.\n\nThe order explains how civil servants should interpret the laws they have sworn to uphold. The short answer: Don’t bother.\n\nThe slightly longer answer: “The president and the attorney general, subject to the president’s supervision and control, shall provide authoritative interpretations of law for the executive branch,” and those interpretations are “controlling” on all federal workers, the order states. “No employee of the executive branch acting in their official capacity may advance an interpretation of the law as the position of the United States that contravenes the president or the attorney general’s opinion on a matter of law.”"

        "full_text": "Senate Republicans are facing crunch time on a long-overdue budget resolution, which has divided their conference over the possibility of cutting Medicaid and adding language to increase the debt ceiling by as much as $5 trillion.\n\nWhether they move on the bill this week could depend largely on a key ruling from Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) has told colleagues that he wanted to get the budget to the floor this week, but that timeline is already slipping as GOP senators have yet to coalesce around the proposal, and it has yet to get the green light from the powerful parliamentarian.\n\nThune told reporters Monday that he’s not yet sure whether the budget will be ready to go this week, noting the discussions with the parliamentarian are “ongoing,” and he wants to make sure nearly his entire conference is “comfortable” with the plan.\n\n“We want to get to it as quickly as we can, and I’m hoping that enables us to move on it this week,” Thune said.\n\nBut he cautioned that moving on the budget requires “having everything ready to go” and cited “the parliamentarian conversations” and “making sure we got everybody in a comfortable place with it.”\n\n“It’s a process,” he said.\n\nSome Senate Republicans, including Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), have made it clear they would not support big cuts to Medicaid that might threaten to reduce the program’s benefits.\n\nMeanwhile, Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.) have raised questions about using a special budgetary scoring model to claim that extending President Trump’s tax cuts won’t add to the deficit.\n\nAnd Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has stated flatly that he won’t support adding language to raise the debt limit by up to $5 trillion unless that total is offset by huge cuts to federal spending.\n\nThe Senate and House must first pass a joint budget resolution to “unlock” the special budget reconciliation process, which will allow them to pass Trump’s agenda through the Senate with a simple majority.\n\nIf the Republicans don’t use the budget reconciliation process, they would need to muster 60 votes to overcome a Democratic filibuster. They currently control a 53-47 majority in the chamber.\n\nSenate Republicans are feeling pressure to move quickly as rank-and-file members, especially in the House, are growing increasingly impatient over the pace of Trump’s agenda.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has set the ambitious goal of getting “one big, beautiful bill” to Trump’s desk by Memorial Day at the latest.\n\n“We just know what we need to do, and we need to get it done sooner rather than later. The last time we did a budget resolution like this it was done before the president was sworn in, so we’re a little bit behind that schedule,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Senate adopted its budget resolution to repeal the Affordable Care Act — Trump’s first priority during his first term — on Jan. 12, 2017, days before Trump took the oath of office.\n\nThe process for laying the groundwork for a bill to secure the border, expand domestic oil and gas drilling, increase defense spending and provide more than $4 trillion in tax relief has taken considerably more time this year.\n\nThune privately told colleagues before the March recess that he thought Johnson’s initial timeline of getting a bill to Trump’s desk by Easter was highly unrealistic, according to Senate sources.\n\nThe biggest obstacle may be MacDonough, who is expected to rule on the question of whether Republicans can use a “current policy” baseline that would allow them to pass a bill to make Trump’s 2017 tax cuts permanent.\n\nIf defined as an extension of current policy, renewing the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would not be scored as adding to the deficit, which would have two big benefits for Republicans: It would allow them to make the tax rates permanent, and it would spare them the headache of coming up with spending cuts, or new tax revenue, to offset their cost.\n\nIf the parliamentarian rules Senate Republicans can use a “current policy” baseline, helping them to score an extension of the 2017 tax cuts as not adding to the deficit after 10 years, then they would not have to “sunset” or automatically end those tax rates after the 10-year budget window. That, in effect, would allow them to extend those tax cuts from Trump’s first term “permanently.”\n\nSenate Republicans are citing the 1974 Budget and Impoundment Control Act to argue that Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has the power to determine the baseline for scoring the cost of the bill during the budget window — usually a period of 10 years — in the “out years” beyond that window.\n\nBut Democrats say that would be a violation of the Senate’s Byrd Rule. Specifically, they say it violates the test prohibiting legislation from adding to the deficit — either by increasing spending or reducing revenue — in the years beyond the budget window.\n\nUnder the Senate’s rules, legislation must comply with the Byrd Rule to be eligible for budget reconciliation protection. Otherwise, it faces a 60-vote hurdle.\n\nDemocrats argue the Republican plan to score the extension of Trump’s tax cuts as an extension of “current policy” that would not add to the deficit is a violation of the 1985 Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act, also known as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act.\n\nThey argue that Section 257 of that law states that current law should serve as the basis for a budget baseline. Under current law, much of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would expire at the end of this year. Therefore, any extension of those expiring provisions would add to the deficit.\n\nA Senate Democratic aide said the Republican plan to use a current-policy baseline to minimize the projected cost of tax cuts “conflicts with statutory directives” in the Balanced Budget Act and would undermine “40 years of Byrd Rule discipline.”\n\nIf the parliamentarian rules in favor of the Democrats, Republicans would have to acknowledge that extending the Trump tax cuts would add trillions of dollars to the deficit.\n\nSuch a ruling would also prevent them from claiming that extending the expiring 2017 tax cuts doesn’t affect revenue beyond the budget revenue, essentially forcing them to sunset those tax provisions to comply with the Byrd Rule and to avoid a Democratic filibuster.\n\nAsked if he expected the parliamentarian to hand down a ruling anytime soon, Thune told The Hill on Monday: “I don’t talk a lot about the discussions with the parliamentarian, but they’re ongoing.”"

        "full_text": "In the ever-turbulent arena of American politics, the specter of double standards looms large. Recent uproar over President Donald Trump's musings about a potential third term starkly contrasts with the muted reactions to former President Barack Obama's similar contemplations. This glaring inconsistency not only exposes media bias but also underscores a troubling trend of selective outrage that undermines the very fabric of our democratic discourse.\n\nOn March 30, 2025, President Trump, during a candid interview with NBC News, hinted at exploring avenues for a third term, stating, “There are methods which you could do it.” He went further, saying, “I’m not joking,” signaling a serious consideration of the idea.\n\nCue the media meltdown. Legacy outlets like The Guardian ran dramatic headlines warning of impending authoritarianism. The Atlantic declared it a “democracy-altering” threat. Pundits tripped over each other racing to call it \"fascist.\" Legal scholars popped up like prairie dogs quoting the 22nd Amendment, which since 1951 has barred presidents from serving more than two terms. Jeremy Paul, a constitutional law professor at Northeastern University, told CBS News, “There are no credible legal arguments for him to run for a third term.”\n\nThe backlash was immediate, relentless, and hysterical. Trump was painted as a madman who would bulldoze the Constitution just to stay in power.\n\nBut let’s rewind to July 28, 2015. President Barack Obama, addressing the African Union in Ethiopia, said, “I actually think I’m a pretty good president. I think if I ran, I could win. But I can’t.” The crowd laughed. The press chuckled. Late-night hosts applauded. It was treated as harmless self-flattery.\n\nFast forward to December 2020. Obama sat down with Stephen Colbert and joked about orchestrating a “third term” through a puppet president. “If I could make an arrangement where I had a stand-in, a front man or front woman, and they had an earpiece in and I was just in my basement in my sweats looking through the stuff… I'd be fine with that,” he said.\n\nWell guess what? He did exactly that.\n\nEnter Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. A man who “ran” for president in 2020 mostly from his Delaware basement, was elected with the help of the most coordinated media, tech, and establishment machine in modern history, and promptly started signing executive orders so fast his own hand couldn’t keep up—because, in many cases, it wasn’t even him. Reporters asked about executive orders his team put in front of him and he literally said, \"I don't know what I'm signing.\"\n\nThat wasn’t a presidency. That was the Obama third term playbook—with Biden as the willing proxy, the empty vessel, the guy with the metaphorical earpiece in, while the Obama team ran the show behind the scenes. They repopulated the West Wing with familiar faces from 2009-2016. Susan Rice, Ron Klain, Jake Sullivan, Jen Psaki—Obama’s bench was back in action, while Biden doddered out for scripted remarks and photo ops.\n\nAnd when the Obama crew decided Biden was no longer useful heading into 2024—he was out. Like a light. Faster than fast. The same press corps that carried him across the finish line in 2020 suddenly had no interest in covering for him. Leaks came from “within the party,” murmurs turned to headlines, and just like that, Obama’s earpiece presidency was over.\n\nThat’s not conspiracy. That’s observable reality.\n\nAnd here’s the kicker: nobody called that an assault on democracy. Nobody cited the 22nd Amendment. Nobody panicked over constitutional violations. Because the guy pulling the strings was their guy. Because the team running the White House didn’t have an “R” next to their names.\n\nSo let’s call this what it is: a blatant double standard. If you're a Democrat, especially one with a cult of personality and media halo like Obama, you can joke about a third term, execute it through a front man, and get praised for your brilliance. If you’re Donald Trump and you mention it out loud? You're an autocrat, a dictator, a constitutional threat.\n\nThis is the problem. It's not about the Constitution anymore—it's about control. It's not about protecting democracy—it's about preserving power for one side. The real threat to the Republic isn’t Trump musing about a third term—it’s a media-political complex that lets one president actually run one.\n\nSo yes, let’s talk about that third term. Let’s talk about the one we just lived through. Because when Obama joked about having a front man in an earpiece, he wasn’t kidding. His name was Joe Biden—and we all watched it happen."

You refused,” St. Clair wrote on X.\n\n“And you weren’t sending *me* money, you were sending support for your child that you thought was necessary … until you withdrew most of it to maintain control and punish me for ‘disobedience,'” she added. “But you’re really only punishing your son.\n\n“It’s ironic that your last effort in court was to try to gag me while you use a social media channel you literally own to distribute derogatory messages about me and our child to the entire world.

        "full_text": "Attorneys representing at least one of 17 alleged Venezuelan gang members who were deported Sunday to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison say the men were sent there two days after a federal judge issued an order prohibiting such deportations.\n\nA federal judge on Friday blocked a Trump administration policy allowing the deportation of migrants to countries other than their own without giving them a chance to argue their removal in immigration court -- although it's unclear whether those deported on Sunday would have been protected by the order.\n\nIn his ruling on Friday, U.S. District Judge Brian E. Murphy blocked the removal of any individual subject to a final order of removal from the United States to a third country other than the country designated for removal in immigration proceedings unless they are given written notice and the opportunity to \"submit an application for protection.\"\n\nThe ruling was issued two days before the Trump administration sent 17 alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to El Salvador's CECOT prison.\n\nAmong the 17 alleged gang members sent to El Salvador was Maiker Espinoza Escalona, who was being held in the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo after being deported from the U.S.\n\nLee Gelernt, an attorney for the ACLU, told ABC News he has serious concerns about what he called the government's \"sudden allegations\" against Escalona that precipitated Escalona's being sent to CECOT.\n\n\"He and others being sent to the Salvadoran prison must be given due process to test the government's assertions,\" Gelernt said.\n\nA White House official told ABC News that the 17 alleged gang members who were deported to El Salvador were not deported under the Alien Enemies Act that was used to send more than 200 alleged gang members to El Salvador last this month, but under different authorities, including Title 8.\n\nThe announcement of the \"counter-terrorism operation\" from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, included no mention of the authority the administration used to deport the 17 individuals.\n\n\"DHS' routine failure to provide meaningful notice and opportunity to present a fear-based claim prior to deportation to a third country has led to hundreds of unlawful deportations, placing individuals at serious risk of persecution, torture, and/or death,\" attorneys for the detainees said in a complaint last week.\n\nEscalona, who entered the U.S. on May 14 and requested asylum, filed a sworn declaration in early March in which he stated that he was not a gang member and asked the government not to send him to Guantanamo.\n\n\"I believe that I am at risk of being transferred because I have a final order of deportation and am from Venezuela,\" Escalona said in the sworn declaration. \"I also believe that I am going to be transferred to Guantanamo because of my tattoos, even though they have nothing to do with gangs. I have twenty tattoos.\"\n\nAuthorities have said they use tattoos to help identify gang members. Escalona, who said in his declaration that he had been in immigration detention in El Paso, Texas, since May 22, listed his tattoos that he said include a cross, a crown, the ghost icon for the social media app Snapchat, his niece's name, and the word \"Faith\" in Spanish.\n\n\"I do not want to be transferred to or detained at Guantanamo. I am afraid of what will happen to me when I get there,\" Escalona said in the declaration. \"I want access to an attorney to help me get out of detention and figure out what options I have in my immigration case.\"\n\n\"If I am transferred to Guantanamo, I will be separated from my family,\" he said.\n\nThe government opposed Escalona's request for a temporary restraining order prohibiting his deportation to Guantanano, Gelernt told ABC News.\n\n\"The government opposed our request for TRO on the ground that he was not in imminent danger of being sent from the U.S. to Guantanamo, but told the Court they would alert it within 2 business days if he or other Plaintiffs were transferred to Guantanamo,\" Gelernt said. \"The government has apparently chosen to use a loophole and transfer him on a Friday night, thereby avoiding notice to the Court at this point. He has apparently now been transferred to the notorious Salvadoran prison.\"\n\nAccording to Escalona's sworn declaration and the ACLU, his partner is currently detained in El Paso and his 2-year-old daughter is under the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement.\n\nThis story has been updated."

        "full_text": "Two Republican-led states have removed hundreds of thousands of registrations from their voter rolls this month, while another identified hundreds of non-citizen voters during their voter list maintenance.\n\nCollectively, the GOP-led states of Idaho and Missouri took nearly 300,000 registrations off their voter rolls after finding inactive, ineligible, or deceased voters, in addition to duplicates and voters who moved. Iowa identified nearly 300 non-citizens on the state’s voter rolls and referred them to the Iowa attorney general.\n\nAt the federal level, support from White House\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued an executive order on election integrity last week, offering assistance to states on maintaining voter rolls. “To identify unqualified voters registered in the States: the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, consistent with applicable law, ensure that State and local officials have, without the requirement of the payment of a fee, access to appropriate systems for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of individuals registering to vote or who are already registered,” the executive order reads.\n\nThe order added that DHS, with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), “shall review each State’s publicly available voter registration list and available records concerning voter list maintenance activities … alongside Federal immigration databases and State records requested, including through subpoena where necessary and authorized by law, for consistency with Federal requirements.”\n\nAlso, within three months of the order, the DHS secretary is to give “the Attorney General complete information on all foreign nationals who have indicated on any immigration form that they have registered or voted in a Federal, State, or local election, and shall also take all appropriate action to submit to relevant State or local election officials such information.”\n\nThe executive order also requires the attorney general to “take appropriate action with respect to States that fail to comply with the list maintenance requirements of the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act.”\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane (R) announced on March 19th that 144,121 voter registrations were removed from the state’s voter rolls during its biennial voter list review and maintenance. The removed registrations were for inactive voters, ineligible voters, and voters who moved. The affected voters were sent notices before their registrations were canceled.\n\n“Ensuring the integrity of our elections starts with maintaining accurate voter rolls,” McGrane said in a statement. “Thanks to the hard work of our county clerks and our collaboration with state and federal agencies, Idaho continues to lead the way in protecting our elections. We are committed to ensuring that only eligible voters are on our rolls, and we are taking every step necessary to make that happen.”\n\nIn July, Idaho Gov. Brad Little (R) issued an executive order to ensure that only U.S. citizens are on the state’s voter rolls, which started a review and verification of registered voters.\n\nIowa\n\nOn March 20th, Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate (R) announced that there were 277 non-citizens confirmed to be on the state’s voter rolls, after gaining access to the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) program. Of the 277 non-citizens, 35 of them cast ballots in the November election, and five attempted to vote but their ballots were rejected.\n\nPate sent proposed legislation to the Iowa legislature that would require citizenship verification when people register to vote.\n\n\"The federal government reviewed our data and verified the citizenship status but refused to share who the noncitizens were,\" Pate said in a statement with the announcement. \"Only eligible Iowa voters should participate in Iowa elections. We are working with the Iowa legislature on solutions to verify citizenship at registration rather than as ballots are cast, and we're confident both chambers will recognize the importance of this legislation. Our proposed solutions will be crucial next steps in confidently balancing voter participation with election integrity.\"\n\nRegarding whether the non-citizens had been removed from the state’s voter rolls, Pate’s office told Just the News on Wednesday, “The 277 noncitizens have been turned over to the Iowa Attorney General and Iowa Department of Public Safety for next steps.” In December, the Iowa attorney general and secretary of state sued then-DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, DHS, then-USCIS Director Ur Jaddou, and UCIS itself for allegedly refusing to inform the state of how many non-citizens were on Iowa’s voter rolls. The case is ongoing.\n\n“Maintaining election integrity is a team sport, and we need cooperation from multiple agencies, including the federal government,” Pate said in a statement. “We are hopeful that between our legislative proposals and this lawsuit, we will have the tools we need to verify voter eligibility during the voter registration processes, allowing us to ensure in the future, only eligible Iowa voters are participating in Iowa elections.”\n\nWhen asked by Just the News about whether the lawsuit will be dropped following the executive order, Pate’s office said, “Our goal is to receive the best possible information to help us maintain Iowa’s election integrity. At this time, we do not have plans to drop the lawsuit. We will be paying close attention to the implementation of the executive order and revisit the question as necessary.”\n\nMissouri\n\nMissouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins (R) announced on March 14th that his state had removed 18,637 deceased voters from Missouri’s voter rolls since Jan. 13th.\n\nState law requires county clerks and local election authorities to examine their voter rolls for people who have moved away, died, or cannot vote anymore. “In Missouri, we are taking action—not just making promises—when it comes to election integrity,” Hoskins said in a statement. “By working hand-in-hand with local election officials, we have removed outdated registrations, strengthening confidence in our elections and making sure every vote cast is legitimate.”"

        "full_text": "Valentina Romei in London and Amy Kazmin in Rome\n\nPublishedMarch 31 2025\n\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\n\nThe number of babies born in Italy dropped 2.6 per cent last year, while the number of Italians leaving the country surged, reflecting the uphill battle that Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni faces to reverse the country’s long-running demographic decline.\n\nJust 370,000 babies were born in Italy in 2024, about 10,000 fewer than last year and well below the half a million born a decade ago, according to figures published by Italy’s national statistics agency Istat on Monday. It was the 16th consecutive year of falling births.\n\nItaly’s demographic woes last year were also exacerbated by a sudden emigration “boom” — with 191,000 Italians relocating abroad in 2024 — a sharp 20.5 per cent rise over the previous year, Istat reported.\n\nItaly has long suffered from a “brain drain” of educated youth going abroad to pursue better career opportunities, with Germany, Spain and the UK the most popular destination for Italians relocating last year, the statistics agency said.\n\nThe repercussions of Italy’s long, steady drop in births are already being felt across the country. Schools in towns and cities are closing for lack of pupils, while beloved baby product companies such as Peg Perego find themselves struggling.\n\nMeloni, who has one school-age daughter herself, has made halting Italy’s alarming demographic trends a policy priority. Her rightwing coalition has tried to encourage baby-making with measures such as longer parental leave and tax breaks for mothers with at least two children.\n\nHowever, the figures suggest “the fiscal incentives of the current government” are “not having the desired effect,” said Melanie Debono, economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. “The lower fertility rate is bad news for potential growth in the longer term, unless the government can come up with some way to boost productivity growth.”\n\nEconomists warn of greater strains to come, as the number of elderly Italians, relative to the working age population, weighs on growth and puts mounting pressure on pensions and the social safety net.\n\nIn 2024, the working age population — those aged between 15 and 64 years old — fell to 63.4 per cent, continuing a steady decline seen since the mid-1990s and down from 66.4 per cent in 2005, Istat data showed.\n\nItaly’s birth rate, the average number of children born to women over their lifetime, dropped to 1.18 in 2024, down from 1.2 in the previous year and the lowest since comparable data began in 1952, the data showed.\n\nOnly a few countries have fertility rates below 1.2 children per woman, including South Korea, China, Spain and Taiwan. This is below what the UN calls the “ultra-low” fertility rate of 1.4 children per woman where falling birth rates become tougher to reverse. It is also well below the replacement level of 2.1 children per woman, at which the population remains stable without immigration.\n\nSome content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.\n\nMeloni’s financial incentives are unlikely to have much impact on the low birth rate, said Maria Rita Testa, an associate professor of demography at Luiss University in Rome, arguing they stemmed from a more fundamental “difficulty in reconciling work and family life”.\n\nItalian woman were discouraged from having children by “the low level of gender equality in the labour market and within the couple”, Testa said, while the country’s family policies were “fragmented” and “have been changing over time continuously”.\n\nNearly a quarter of Italians are now over 65, with more than 23,500 people aged 100 or more, making Italy one of the world’s oldest countries after Japan and Monaco, according to the World Bank.\n\nRecommended\n\n“The demographic drag is one of the main factors that will severely constrain Italian potential growth,” said Nicola Nobile, economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics.\n\nLast year, the OECD warned that declining birth rates across its member countries were putting the “prosperity of future generations at risk” and urged governments to prepare for a “low-fertility future”.\n\nItaly’s total births this year were the lowest since the country’s unification in 1861. The overall population shrank by 37,000 to 58.9mn at the end of 2024, continuing a decline that began in 2014."

        "full_text": "An unnamed woman is suing an Illinois abortionist for malpractice after she allegedly suffered from severe and potentially life-threatening complications from a late-term abortion at his hands in 2023.\n\nIn a legal complaint filed on March 21, “Jane Doe” claims Keith Reisinger-Kindle of Equity Clinic in Champaign, Illinois performed a two-day dilation and evacuation abortion that, unbeknownst to the woman on the table, perforated her uterus, failed to remove all of the dead baby’s body parts from her body, and left her with “irreversible suffering and emotional damages.” Kindle, who allegedly did not administer drugs to stop the child’s heart in utero, supposedly dismembered the baby alive.\n\nThe woman, who was 22 weeks pregnant at the time, was technically eligible for a no-questions-asked late-term abortion due to Illinois’ radical abortion permissions.\n\nIn fact, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker had just endorsed the radical expansion of abortion and created carve-outs shielding abortionists a few months prior to the problematic procedure named in the complaint. Pritzker’s sweeping declaration comes in addition to Illinois’ lack of abortion facility regulation.\n\nHowever, the unnamed woman did not, as outlined in the complaint, escape the physical, emotional, and mental harm known to accompany abortion.\n\nJust one day after Kindle certified that the “[p]roducts of conception were visibly inspected and confirmed to be complete,” the complaint details, the woman called Equity Clinic twice with complaints of cramping, pressure, and difficulty breathing. She was advised to take over-the-counter pain medicine and a laxative.\n\nIt wasn’t until April 4, 2023, two days after the abortion was complete and one day after she had taken the medicine suggested by Equity Clinic, that the pained woman sought emergency care. When she arrived at a hospital in the neighboring state of Indiana, the woman was found to be suffering from uterine rupture, had “half of a deceased pre-born human being” in her pelvis, and “pieces of the fetal skull that were adherent to the patient’s intestine,” according to the complaint.\n\nThe responding surgeon Dr. Stephen Joseph O’Neil pressed Kindle on April 5 about the circumstances surrounding the woman’s condition but was spurned when the abortionist “refused to answer any questions or provide any information … claiming lack of consent from Plaintiff,” the complaint continues.\n\nThe woman was allegedly unaware of this exchange, even after discussing her hospital visit with Kindle on the phone the same day. During this same discussion on April 5, the woman asked Kindle about the sex of her aborted baby.\n\nThe lawsuit states that Kindle “knew that it was impossible at that point to determine the pre-born child’s sex because whatever fetal remains had been removed from Plaintiff had already been discarded,” but led her on by promising to “look again.”\n\n“On April 5, 2023, KINDLE’s conduct in telling Plaintiff that he would ‘look again’ to determine the sex of her pre-born child despite his knowledge that such a determination was at that point forever beyond any person’s ability to ascertain, was outrageous, exceeded all bounds of human decency, and is intolerable in a civilized society,” the lawsuit states.\n\nThe complaint demands a monetary judgment be levied against Kindle and his staff for their “medical negligence”and “infliction of emotional distress” in handling Jane Doe’s abortion. As a result, the lawsuit states the woman possesses “psychiatric damages and physical damages that will affect her ability to carry and deliver children for the rest of her life.”\n\n“The plaintiff has and will continue to incur medical expenses in treating her emotional injuries, and has and will continue to be unable to attend to her usual and customary affairs of life as a result of her emotional injuries,” the complaint continues.\n\nPlenty of women across the U.S. have suffered harm and distress at the hands of the surgical and chemical abortion industry. Yet, abortion entities known for committing atrocities continue to receive taxpayer funds and protection from states like Illinois.\n\nJordan Boyd is a staff writer at The Federalist and producer of The Federalist Radio Hour.

        "full_text": "President Trump has once again floated the idea of testing the Constitution's presidential term limits by seeking a third term, as his administration continues to challenge constitutional provisions and push an expansive view of executive power.\n\nAfter telling NBC News that he's \"not joking\" about the possibility and that there are \"methods\" that would allow him to serve a third time, Trump declined to confirm to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday that he's planning to leave the White House after his second term ends on Jan. 20, 2029.\n\nThe 22nd Amendment prohibits a person from being elected U.S. president more than twice. The states ratified the restriction in 1951 in the wake of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's controversial third and fourth terms during World War II, which bucked a two-term norm set by George Washington.\n\nChanging presidential term limits with a new constitutional amendment would need support from three-fourths of the states.\n\nBut some legal experts point to plausible strategies for attempting end runs around the 22nd Amendment under unusual scenarios.\n\nWhat Trump has said, and what the 22nd Amendment says\n\nWhile Trump regularly spins up news cycles with surprising or unprecedented comments, his latest public remarks are not the first time the 78-year-old president has mentioned a potential pursuit of a third term.\n\n\"I suspect I won't be running again,\" Trump reportedly told a group of House Republicans last November, after he won the election — that is, he added to laughs, unless the lawmakers say he's \"good\" enough for them to \"figure\" out a way.\n\nTrump's remark drew swift pushback from Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman of New York, who quickly introduced a House resolution to reaffirm that the Constitution's term limits for elected presidents apply to Trump and his nonconsecutive terms.\n\nThe 22nd Amendment's words would undermine any argument that Trump's nonconsecutive terms grant him an exception to the two-term limit, says William Baude, a professor who leads the Constitutional Law Institute at the University of Chicago Law School.\n\n\"There is no wiggle room\" on the rule that a president can't be elected more than twice, Baude says. \"That's a clear statement of the Constitution, and I don't think any serious person is going to interpret it otherwise.\"\n\nThree days after Trump's second inauguration, however, Republican Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee introduced a joint resolution to propose a change to the Constitution so that a person could be elected president three times if they had not been previously elected to two consecutive terms.\n\nBut winning an election is not the only way a person can become president. And there are hypothetical situations involving presidential succession, Baude adds, that are \"not addressed as fully\" by the Constitution's text. They reveal ways in which the common understanding of the 22nd Amendment's presidential term limits could be challenged in court.\n\nOne theory: Trump could become vice president and then president in 2029\n\nAsked by NBC News about a scenario involving Vice President Vance, Trump said that \"that's one\" method.\n\nA 1999 Minnesota Law Review article called \"The Twice and Future President\" explains that a twice-elected president could become vice president and then — if the current president were to be removed from office, resign or die — return as commander-in-chief.\n\nThe federal government-sanctioned record of interpretations of the Constitution also points to the possibility of a former two-term president serving as speaker of the House of Representatives or as another federal officer who could become president through the Presidential Succession Act of 1947.\n\nAll of these hypothetical situations get around a key word in the 22nd Amendment's restriction — \"elected.\" Bruce Peabody, one of the law review article's co-authors, who is now a professor of government and politics at Fairleigh Dickinson University, says Congress chose that term after considering proposals that would have made a twice-elected president not eligible to \"hold\" the office again.\n\n\"There definitely was awareness that the more narrow language they'd come up with was not going to cover every scenario,\" explains Peabody, adding that it can be difficult to make sense of the lawmakers' intent.\n\nTheir word choice, however, has given rise to what Brian Kalt — a law professor at Michigan State University who wrote about a hypothetical two-term president getting nominated to run for vice president in Constitutional Cliffhangers: A Legal Guide for Presidents and Their Enemies — calls a loophole in the 22nd Amendment's two-term limit.\n\nDwight Eisenhower, the first U.S. president to be constitutionally barred from running for a third term, alluded to it in 1960.\n\nAsked whether he wanted to formally declare support for then-Vice President Richard Nixon as the Republican presidential nominee, Eisenhower drew laughter at a news conference when he replied: \"You know, the only thing I know about the presidency the next time is this: I can't run. But someone has raised the question that were I invited, could I constitutionally run for vice president, and you might find out about that one. I don't know.\"\n\nIn the decades since then, similar chatter about the loophole in legal and political circles has surrounded other twice-elected presidents, including Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.\n\n\"That talk never was all that serious. But in a certain situation where the president is sort of more popular than the common understanding of the Constitution, you better believe people will jump all over any loophole they can and allow that person to flout term limits. And we've seen it in other countries. Everywhere there are term limits, there are vulnerabilities,\" Kalt says.\n\nOther legal experts, however, point to the last sentence of the 12th Amendment, which covers the Electoral College, as a roadblock for any twice-elected president attempting to return to the White House through the vice presidency. It says that \"no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.\"\n\nStill, in court, a lawyer could try to argue that being a \"natural born\" citizen, at least 35 years old and a resident within the U.S. for at least 14 years are the only presidential eligibility requirements specified in the Constitution, says Stephen Gillers, a professor emeritus at New York University School of Law, who proposed in 2004 that Clinton run for vice president.\n\n\"I want to make it very clear that I'm identifying an argument that Trump could make in order to get back into the White House. I'm not endorsing it,\" Gillers says. \"But we know from experience that even if it's far-fetched and it offers the possibility of a third presidential term, Trump will make it. If his health holds up, he will make the argument he likes the job. Whether or not it succeeds in court is another matter.\"\n\nGillers posits that Trump \"could make a deal\" with Vance that, ahead of the 2028 election, they switch places on the Republican ticket, and if they win the White House again, Vance resigns and Trump becomes president.\n\nTo avoid any debate about whether the 12th Amendment forbids presidential electors from choosing a twice-elected president as vice president, Gillers says there could be a similar arrangement in which Trump does not run on the winning Republican ticket but, after the newly elected vice president resigns, becomes vice president with congressional approval.\n\n\"It is not implausible. And just the existence of the possibility of it in the next four years gives Trump power that enhances his position,\" Gillers says. \"The members of Congress in 2027 will know that they're not dealing with a lame duck necessarily because Trump could still hold out, through 2027 and 2028, the possibility of his return to power and the power that that possibility gives him — to get Congress to bend to his will.\"\n\nHow would the U.S. Supreme Court react to any attempt at a third Trump term?\n\nA more straightforward possibility that some constitutional scholars have not ruled out is Trump running for a third term as president regardless of what the 22nd Amendment says.\n\n\"If you think about it, the 22nd Amendment assumes that one would follow the Constitution,\" says Gloria Browne-Marshall, a constitutional law professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. \"But if one is not going to follow the Constitution, what difference does it make what's written there?\"\n\nAny attempt at a third Trump administration would likely spark lawsuits that end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. And in this polarized political environment, it's difficult to predict how the court's conservative supermajority would rule, says Aziz Huq, a constitutional law professor at the University of Chicago Law School, who has been focusing on democratic backsliding.\n\n\"The court has ways of ducking the 22nd Amendment question. And if the court ducks the question, then it would be up to other actors — whether in the states, for example, in the process of nominations and primary votes or Congress at the moment at which it determines who won the Electoral College — to decide on whether the 22nd Amendment had the force of law,\" Huq says.\n\nBrowne-Marshall warns that such a test of the Constitution's presidential term limits could further destabilize the U.S. political landscape at a time when the ability of the courts and Congress to serve as checks and balances to the White House is under question.\n\n\"I don't think everyone is going to sit back and let him become a king without fighting back through protest,\" Browne-Marshall says. \"We're looking at a lot of the weight to fall on the regular people if we don't have the checks and balances of the other two branches.\"\n\nThe timing of Trump's latest comments — more than three years before the 2028 election — leaves open the possibility of a new constitutional amendment that definitively blocks a potential third Trump term, points out Peabody, the Fairleigh Dickinson University professor.\n\n\"The nation is on notice, and it has the power to act if it doesn't like this possibility,\" Peabody says."

        "full_text": "NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump’s executive order seeking to overhaul the nation’s elections faced its first legal challenges Monday as the Democratic National Committee and a pair of nonprofits filed two separate lawsuits calling it unconstitutional.\n\nThe Campaign Legal Center and the State Democracy Defenders Fund brought the first lawsuit Monday afternoon. The DNC, the Democratic Governors Association, and Senate and House Democratic leaders followed soon after with a complaint of their own.\n\nBoth lawsuits filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ask the court to block Trump’s order and declare it illegal.\n\n“The president’s executive order is an unlawful action that threatens to uproot our tried-and-tested election systems and silence potentially millions of Americans,” said Danielle Lang, senior director of voting rights at the D.C.-based Campaign Legal Center. “It is simply not within the president’s authority to set election rules by executive decree, especially when they would restrict access to voting in this way.”\n\nThe White House didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe legal challenges had been expected after election lawyers warned some of Trump’s demands in the order, including a proof-of-citizenship requirement for voter registration and new ballot deadline rules, may violate the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe order also asserts power that legal experts say the president doesn’t have over an independent agency. That agency, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, sets voluntary voting system guidelines and maintains the federal voter registration form.\n\nThe suits come as Congress is considering codifying a proof-of-citizenship requirement for voter registration into law, and as Trump has promised more actions related to elections in the coming weeks.\n\nBoth the legal challenges draw attention to the Constitution’s “ Elections Clause,” which says states — not the president — get to decide the “times, places and manner” of how elections are run. That section of the Constitution also gives Congress the power to “make or alter” election regulations, at least for federal office, but it doesn’t mention any presidential authority over election administration.\n\n“The Constitution is clear: States set their own rules of the road when it comes to elections, and only Congress has the power to override these laws with respect to federal elections,” said Lang, calling the executive order an “unconstitutional executive overreach.”\n\nThe lawsuits also argue the president’s order could disenfranchise voters. The nonprofits’ lawsuit names three voter advocacy organizations as plaintiffs that they allege are harmed by Trump’s executive order: the League of United Latin American Citizens, the Secure Families Initiative and the Arizona Students’ Association.\n\nThe DNC’s lawsuit highlights the role of the government’s controversial cost-cutting arm, the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nIt alleges the order’s data-sharing requirements, including instructing DOGE to cross-reference federal data with state voter lists, violate Democrats’ privacy rights and increase the risk that they will be harassed “based on false suspicions that they are not qualified to vote.”\n\n“This executive order is an unconstitutional power grab from Donald Trump that attacks vote by mail, gives DOGE sensitive personal information and makes it harder for states to run their own free and fair elections,” reads a statement from the plaintiffs.\n\nTrump, one of the top spreaders of election falsehoods, has argued this executive order will secure the vote against illegal voting by noncitizens. Multiple studies and investigations in individual states have shown that noncitizens casting ballots in federal elections, already a felony, is exceedingly rare.\n\nMonday’s lawsuits against Trump’s elections order could be followed by more challenges. Other voting rights advocates, including the American Civil Liberties Union, have said they’re considering legal action. Several Democratic state attorneys general have said they are looking closely at the order and suspect it is illegal.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump’s order has received praise from the top election officials in some Republican states who say it could inhibit instances of voter fraud and give them access to federal data to better maintain their voter rolls.\n\nIf courts determine the order can stand, the changes Trump wants are likely to cause some headaches for both election administrators and voters. State election officials, who already have lost some federal cybersecurity assistance, would have to spend time and money to comply with the order, including potentially buying new voting systems and educating voters of the rules.\n\nThe proof-of-citizenship requirement also could cause confusion or voter disenfranchisement because millions of eligible voting-age Americans do not have the proper documents readily available. In Kansas, which had a proof-of-citizenship requirement for three years before it was overturned, the state’s own expert estimated that almost all the roughly 30,000 people who were prevented from registering to vote during the time it was in effect were U.S. citizens who had been eligible.\n\nMonday’s lawsuits are the latest of numerous efforts to fight the flurry of executive actions Trump has taken during the first months of his second term. Federal judges have partially or fully blocked many of them, including efforts to restrict birthright citizenship, ban transgender people from military service and curb diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives among federal contractors and grant recipients.\n\n___"

        "full_text": "Iran President Masoud Pezeshkian said Sunday that the Islamic Republic rejected direct negotiations with the United States in response to a letter President Trump sent earlier this month over the country's rapidly advancing nuclear program. It was Tehran's first official response to Mr. Trump's letter.\n\n\"Although the possibility of direct negotiations between the two sides has been rejected in this response, it has been emphasized that the path for indirect negotiations remains open,\" Pezeshkian said, adding Iran's response was delivered via the sultanate of Oman.\n\nIt's unclear, however, whether Mr. Trump would accept indirect negotiations. Indirect negotiations have been unsuccessful for years since Mr. Trump initially withdrew the U.S. from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers in 2018.\n\nThe White House offered no immediate reaction to the announcement.\n\nMr. Trump revealed in an interview with Fox News Channel's \"Sunday Morning Futures\" earlier this month that he had sent a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urging him to negotiate and warning of potential military action if it refused.\n\n\"I would rather negotiate a deal. I'm not sure that everybody agrees with me, but we can make a deal that would be just as good as if you won militarily,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But the time is happening now. The time is coming up. Something's going to happen one way or the other. I hope that Iran — and I've written him a letter, saying, 'I hope you're going to negotiate.' Because if we have to go in militarily, it's going to be a terrible thing — for them.\"\n\nOn Sunday, in an interview with NBC News taped before Pezeshkian's comments, Mr. Trump reiterated that he is considering military action and secondary tariffs if Iran does not agree to a nuclear deal.\n\n\"If they don't make a deal, there will be bombing and it will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before,\" he said.\n\nMr. Trump's overture comes as both Israel and the U.S. have warned they will never let Iran acquire a nuclear weapon, leading to fears of a military confrontation as Tehran enriches uranium at near weapons-grade levels – something only done by atomic-armed nations.\n\nIran has long maintained its program is for peaceful purposes, even as its officials increasingly threaten to pursue the bomb as tensions are high with the U.S. over its sanctions and after the collapse of a ceasefire in Israel's war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\nAs the U.S. conducts intense airstrikes targeting the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels of Yemen, the risk of military action targeting Iran's nuclear program remains on the table.\n\nA report last month by the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Iran had \"significantly increased production and accumulation of high enriched uranium.\"\n\nLast week, Khamenei warned that U.S. threats against his country \"will get them nowhere,\" adding that Americans \"and others should know that if they do anything malign to the Iranian nation, they will get a hard slap.\"\n\nHe had previously dismissed Mr. Trump's overtures for talks, accusing the U.S. president of attempting to deceive global public opinion by portraying the United States as willing to negotiate and Iran as unwilling to engage.\n\nMr. Trump's first term in office was marked by a particularly troubled period in relations with Tehran. In 2018, he unilaterally withdrew the United States from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers, leading to sanctions hobbling Iran's economy. Iran retaliated with attacks at sea — including one that it likely carried out and that temporarily halved Saudi Arabia's oil production.\n\nTrump also ordered the attack that killed Iran's top general in a Baghdad drone strike in January 2020."

        "full_text": "US President Donald Trump accused the Ukrainian president of “trying to back out” of the minerals deal expected to be agreed between the two countries as early as this week, adding that Volodymyr Zelensky would face “big problems” if he didn’t sign an agreement. But Ukraine has highlighted that the conditions of the deal changed significantly in recent days.\n\n“I see he’s trying to back out of the rare earth deal. And if he does that, he’s got some problems. Big, big problems,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force Once on Sunday. “We made a deal on rare earth and now he’s saying, ‘well, you know, I want to renegotiate the deal.’”\n\n“He wants to be a member of NATO. Well, he was never going to be a member of NATO. He understands that. So if he’s looking to renegotiate the deal, he’s got big problems,” Trump said.\n\nHowever, Zelensky told reporters Tuesday evening in Kyiv that “NATO membership is not a part of this deal and never was,” adding that Ukraine is “ready for an unconditional ceasefire.”\n\nZelensky also said last week that the conditions of the deal being negotiated are “constantly changing,” but overall, Ukraine feels positively toward a future agreement.\n\nUkraine received a new draft of the text on Friday, according to its foreign ministry. The new proposal, seen by CNN, was put forward by the US Treasury Department and goes well beyond the initial draft, particularly on future US rights and reimbursement for past assistance.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said they had held one round of consultations on the new version, and both sides were working “to reach a mutually acceptable text for signing.”\n\nThe Ukrainian president said last Thursday that the two countries had already agreed to a “framework agreement” and then a full agreement would be hashed out later, involving more research and ratification in the Ukrainian parliament. But then the US-side changed its position to put forward “a full agreement right away,” Zelensky said.\n\n“So it’s too early to talk about the agreement, which has been changed several times. But I would not want the US to have a feeling that Ukraine is against it in general,” Zelensky said. “We have consistently shown our positive signals. We are for cooperation with the United States.”\n\nAn initial minerals deal went unsigned following Trump’s contentious Oval Office meeting with Zelensky in February.\n\nBut it has been revived in the form of the new proposal that would give the US more access to Kyiv’s rare earth minerals, according to two people familiar with the discussions and a copy of the draft proposal obtained by CNN on Thursday.\n\nIt does not, however, include language regarding one of Ukraine’s priorities — concrete security guarantees in the country’s ongoing war with Russia.\n\nThe deal would apply to all mineral resources, oil and gas across all of Ukraine, the sources said.\n\nA key part of the proposal requires Ukrainian enterprises to contribute to a joint US-Ukraine investment fund that would be overseen by a five-person board consisting of three members from Washington and two from Kyiv – prompting concerns that Ukraine would be ceding sweeping control of key assets to the United States.\n\nThe draft obtained by CNN states that previous US assistance to Ukraine would be “deemed as contributions” to the partnership fund – something Kyiv has said it would not agree to, given that likely means Ukraine would not benefit from any revenues until the US has recouped all its assistance money.\n\nThe proposed agreement would give the US the “right of first offer” for all future natural resources projects and infrastructure investment projects. It also includes a clause stating Ukraine must make an effort to prevent critical minerals sales to any purchasers located in a country that the US International Development Finance Corporation “identifies as a strategic competitor of the United States.”\n\nThe Trump administration has argued that the potential minerals deal would serve as a leading reason for the US to remain invested in Ukraine as Washington pursues an end to the war.\n\nTrump has also referred to a rare earth minerals agreement as a way for the US to be compensated for the aid and military assistance sent to Ukraine.\n\n“The mineral deal offers Ukraine the opportunity to form an enduring economic relationship with the United States that is the basis for long term security and peace. It will strengthen our two nations’ relationship and benefit both parties,” National Security Council spokesman James Hewitt told CNN. “The deal will help make Ukraine prosperous and reflects America’s past and current commitment to Ukraine.”\n\nMeanwhile, Washington and Moscow have also started talks related to cooperation on rare earth metals and other projects in Russia.\n\nThe Kremlin said Monday that no documents have been signed yet, but there is interest in cooperation.\n\nIt comes as Trump continues to push for an end to the war, expressing open frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the weekend.\n\n“I was very angry – pissed off – when Putin started getting into Zelensky’s credibility, because that’s not going in the right location, you understand?” Trump told NBC News in an interview, referring to the Russian leader’s comments suggesting Ukraine be put under a “temporary administration” while the two nations work toward a ceasefire deal.\n\nTrump continued, “But new leadership means you’re not gonna have a deal for a long time, right? … But I was pissed off about it. But if a deal isn’t made, and if I think it was Russia’s fault, I’m going to put secondary sanctions on Russia.”\n\n“If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia’s fault, which it might not be, but if I think it was Russia’s fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out of Russia,” Trump said.\n\nAsked on Sunday aboard Air Force One if there is a deadline for Putin to agree to a deal, Trump said: “It’s a psychological deadline. If I think they’re tapping us along, I will not be happy about it.”\n\nMeanwhile, Finland’s president, who made a surprise visit to Florida over the weekend to meet Trump and play a round of golf, said he told his US counterpart a deadline should be set.\n\nAfter the two leaders’ meeting in Florida, Finnish President Alexander Stubb told reporters that Trump’s patience with Russia was running out.\n\n“April 20 would be a good time for a full ceasefire without any conditions… Because a deadline is needed, because it is Easter and because President Donald Trump will have been in office for three months,” Stubb said Sunday regarding his suggestion for a deadline.\n\nCNN’s Kosta Gak, Victoria Butenko, Anna Chernova, Betsy Klein, Anna Cooban and Mariya Knight contributed to this report.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details."

        "full_text": "WASHINGTON - Dr. Peter Marks, the top vaccine official at the Food and Drug Administration, wrote in a letter on Friday that he was resigning from his position and criticized Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has questioned the effectiveness of vaccines for years and promoted debunked claims that certain vaccines are linked to autism.\n\nIn the letter addressed to Acting FDA Commissioner Sara Brenner, Marks said he would resign and retire as Director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research effective April 5, according to a copy obtained by The Washington Post and The New York Times. The center is responsible for examining the safety and effectiveness of biological products such as vaccines.\n\n“As you are aware, I was willing to work to address the Secretary's concerns regarding vaccine safety and transparency by hearing from the public and implementing a variety of different public meetings and engagements with the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine,” Marks wrote in the letter.\n\n“However, it has become clear that truth and transparency are not desired by the Secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies,” he added.\n\nMarks added that “undermining confidence in well-established vaccines” is “irresponsible, detrimental to public health, and a clear danger to our nation's health, safety(,) and security.”\n\nMarks joined the Food and Drug Administration in 2012 as deputy center director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, and later became the director in 2016, according to his webpage. He was instrumental in carrying out Operation Warp Speed under the first Trump administration, which was a federal effort to speed up the development of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nDr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that Marks “is one of the most brilliant, dedicated scientists and public servants.” Jha served as the White House COVID-19 response coordinator under the former Biden administration.\n\n“He helped usher in scientific rigor and transparency into the FDA. And tonight, he is being pushed out,” Jha wrote on Friday. “Making the FDA dramatically weaker, less effective. This is not how we make America healthy.”"

        "full_text": "COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A South Carolina death row inmate on Friday chose execution by firing squad, just five weeks after the state carried out its first death by bullets.\n\nMikal Mahdi, who pleaded guilty to murder for killing a police officer in 2004, is scheduled to be executed April 11.\n\nMahdi, 41, had the choice of dying by firing squad, lethal injection or the electric chair. He will be the first inmate to be executed in the state since Brad Sigmon chose to be shot to death on March 7. A doctor pronounced Sigmon dead less than three minutes after three bullets tore into his heart.\n\n“Faced with barbaric and inhumane choices, Mikal Mahdi has chosen the lesser of three evils,” one of his lawyers, David Weiss, said in a statement. “Mikal chose the firing squad instead of being burned and mutilated in the electric chair, or suffering a lingering death on the lethal injection gurney.”\n\nMahdi ambushed Orangeburg public safety officer James Myers at the officer’s shed in Calhoun County in July 2004. Myers had just returned from an out-of-town birthday celebration for his wife, sister and daughter, prosecutors said.\n\nMyers’ wife found his burned body, shot at least eight times including twice in the head, in the shed that had been the backdrop for their wedding less than 15 months earlier, authorities said.\n\nMahdi will be strapped to a chair 15 feet (4.6 meters) from three prison employees who volunteered to be on the firing squad. A target will be placed on his chest. Their rifles will all be loaded with a live round that shatters when it hits his rib cage.\n\nAside from Sigmon, only three other U.S. inmates — all in Utah — have been killed by a firing squad in the past 50 years. Sigmon was the first inmate killed by bullets in the U.S. since 2010.\n\nMahdi’s lawyers have filed a final appeal with the state’s highest court, saying Mahdi’s case for a life sentence at his original trial took only 30 minutes and that his lawyers failed to call anyone who could testify on his behalf.\n\nIt “didn’t even span the length of a Law & Order episode, and was just as superficial,” they said.\n\nSeveral defense lawyer organizations have filed briefs saying no one should be executed after such little effort to defend them.\n\nMahdi’s lawyers said that as a juvenile Mahdi spent months in isolation in prison and that this altered his developing brain and affected his judgement.\n\nAfter Mahdi pleaded guilty to murder, Judge Clifton Newman said he sentenced the young man to death because a sense of humanity he tried to find in every defendant seemed not to exist in Mahdi.\n\nProsecutors responded to the claim of a poor defense by saying Mahdi was able to present much more evidence during a 2011 appeal that had to be heard inside a prison because Mahdi had stabbed a death row guard during in an escape attempt. A judge rejected the appeal.\n\n“In Mahdi’s vernacular, if his mitigation presentation before Judge Newman ‘didn’t even span the length of a Law & Order episode,’ the review of any potential error is in its 24th season,” the state Attorney General’s Office wrote in court papers.\n\nProsecutors said a lot of the new evidence would help Mahdi’s case, including a string of attacks and threats on prison employees; his guilty plea to killing a convenience store clerk in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, before the South Carolina killing; and two other deaths that authorities in Virginia think he may be connected to.\n\n“The nature of the man is violence,” prosecutors wrote.\n\nMahdi has one more opportunity to live — he can ask Republican Gov. Henry McMaster to reduce his sentence to life in prison without parole just minutes before his scheduled execution at 6 p.m. on April 11 at the Broad River Correctional Institution in Columbia.\n\nBut no South Carolina governor has offered clemency in the 47 executions in the state since the death penalty resumed in the U.S. in 1976."

        "full_text": "Barack Obama has shared a candid revelation about his marriage to Michelle Obama.\n\nThe former US president opened up about the state of his relationship to Michelle while “speaking publicly” for “the first time in a while” during a talk at Hamilton College on Thursday (3 April).\n\nWhile Barack, 63, shared his negative views on Trump’s presidency, and rebuked his tariff announcement, he also admitted that he has been in what he called “a deep deficit with my wife”.\n\nIn the past, Barack has hinted that his presidency affected his marriage to Michelle, 61, stating: “It sure helps to be out of the White House.”\n\nThe Daily Beast now reports that Obama told Steven Tepper, the president of Hamilton College, that he has been actively trying to spend more time with Michelle, to whom he has been married for 32 years, as life increasingly gets in the way.\n\n“I’ve been trying to dig myself out of that hole by doing occasionally fun things,” he candidly told Tepper.\n\nMichelle previously opened up about her marriage during an interview with Revolt TV, in which she said of the effort her and her husband put in: “There are times I’m 70, he’s 30. There are times he’s 60, I’m 40.”\n\nShe also said “there were 10 years” where she “couldn’t stand” Barack, but added: “I would take 10 bad years over 30. It’s just how you look at it.”\n\nAccording to Michelle, the issue stemmed from a realisation that the couple’s marriage wasn’t “even” at the time, as she noted that she was taking care of the children and her husband was embarking on his political career.\n\nBarack had two terms as US president, which lasted from 2009 to 2017.\n\n“That’s when all the measuring starts,” she continued, while acknowledging that couples often “turn that ire on each other”.\n\nAccording to Page Six, a source who once worked with the couple said of the rumours their marriage was struggling: They don’t pretend that they have this Camelot relationship. They’re not trying to present that they’re this magical couple.”\n\nWhile rumours surfaced that the pair were headed for divorce, due to Barack attending high-profile Washington DC events by himself, another insider said this was merely due to the fact Michelle had no interest in going to the US capital.\n\nIn December 2022, Michelle said that, for a marriage to work, even in times of struggle or disagreement, you’ve “got to know your person” and “like” who they are.\n\n“I mean, you could be mad at him, but do you still look at him and go: ‘I’m not happy with you, but I respect you. I don’t agree with you, but you’re still a kind, smart person,’” she said, before noting “feelings are going to change over time,” and that that is when couples need to put work into their relationships”."

        "full_text": "The Trump administration has signaled the military won't be focusing on climate change, a move that follows decades of climate research.\n\nEvery other winter, the U.S. military gathers with allies on the Arctic for Operation Ice Camp as the warming region becomes increasingly accessible, raising concerns about borders and peace.\n\nAt the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, a $37 million sea wall project was finished last year to keep out the rising tides now flooding the base 30 to 40 times a year.\n\nWhen a worsening drought and warmer-than-normal temperatures fanned the California wildfires in January, the Air Force, Navy and National Guard all responded to help.\n\nThe nation’s warfighters – sworn to protect the nation against enemies both foreign and domestic – increasingly serve on the front lines of the battle against the impacts of climate change. And the department has been active in documenting the risks and impacts for decades.\n\nHowever, the new administration, under Pete Hegseth, secretary of the department of defense, has stated several times it won't be focusing on climate change, in what appears to be a departure from the department's stance in the past.\n\nA Pentagon spokesman, John Ullyot, told CNN that “Climate zealotry and other woke chimeras of the Left are not part of\" the department's core mission.\n\nIn March, Hegseth shared a post about those comments on X, stating the department \"does not do climate change crap.\"\n\nIn a video, Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said the department was eliminating “woke climate change\" programs.\n\nSince 2022, the U.S. military has been deployed to more than 170 climate-related events in the U.S. and other countries, according to a tracker kept by the Center for Climate and Security, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit research institute.\n\nWhile climate change doesn’t cause extreme weather events, scientists say it makes naturally occurring events more intense in terms of rainfall, drought and convective storms, as well as higher tides.\n\nThe recent comments by the defense department surprised some national security experts and climate scientists.\n\n“I have found the Department of Defense to be incredibly enlightened on climate change,” said Robert Young, a geology professor at Western Carolina University and director of its Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines. “Any role that anyone would play in not allowing the DOD to adapt to the changing natural environment at military bases at home and abroad is going to be detrimental to our ability to maintain national security.”\n\nClimate change is “a fundamental force,” said Tom Ellison, deputy director of the Center for Climate Security. “It really affects everything the military has to do, from the very smallest thing to very long-term strategic planning, Ellison said. For example:\n\nHow to train troops when it’s dangerously hot\n\nHow changing ocean chemistry affects submarine sonar\n\nHow to keep airfield runways from melting in extreme heat\n\n“These are all things that are already happening,” he said.\n\nMilitary bases flood during rainfall events supercharged by warming oceans, relocate fighter jets ahead of more intense hurricanes and face heightened climate-driven security risks in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nOn his first day after being assigned to the Norfolk Naval Station in 2012, Mark Nevitt, a former Navy JAG and Navy environmental attorney, now a professor at Emory University School of Law, couldn’t get home because a high tide had flooded the road.\n\n“It was routine that I couldn't get to base or could not get home from work,” he said. “That’s only getting worse.” Federal data from the nearby tidal gauge in Sewells Point, Virginia, dates back to the 1920s and shows sea level has risen six inches at that spot since 1990.\n\nNevitt has called climate change “a ‘super wicked’ problem that exacerbates and accelerates already existing threats.”\n\n'Training and warfighting'\n\nEven before his appointment, Hegseth had a history of downplaying climate change.\n\nIn a Fox News clip in 2020, he called concern about the climate threat “a religion” and criticized Senator Bernie Sanders for calling it a “major national security issue.”\n\nHis March remarks came after the department announced it would stop funding 91 studies, including research on climate change impacts and global migration patterns, which experts identify as a growing security risk for the nation and its allies.\n\nCanceling the research would save more than $30 million in the first year, about .03% of the department’s $850 billion annual budget, the department stated. It reflects a \"commitment to fiscal responsibility and ensuring every dollar invested in defense generates the greatest possible return for the American people,\" the department stated.\n\nIn the X post, Hegseth wrote: “The @DeptofDefense does not do climate change crap. We do training and warfighting.”\n\nThe department did not respond to a request for comment on what Hegseth meant by the post or provide a requested list of the cuts.\n\nThe cuts parallel a playbook suggested by experts associated with the Heritage Foundation in a document called “Mandate for Leadership 2025: The Conservative Promise.” Commonly called “Project 2025,” it recommends prioritizing the “core roles and responsibilities of the military over social engineering and non-defense matters, including climate change.”\n\nDecades of military research\n\nU.S. intelligence and military assessments of the security dangers from climate change go back nearly four decades, said Peter Gleick, co-founder and senior fellow at Pacific Institute, a climate think tank. Gleick has studied the military’s strategy for decades and maintains a timeline of dozens of the department’s intelligence and defense assessments of climate change.\n\nThe growing body of work includes analyses from every U.S. defense, intelligence, and security agency and the White House, he said. Reports document the vulnerability of bases, as well as security issues related to the impacts of climate change in the Middle East, Africa, Arctic and Pacific.\n\nRepublican and Democrat presidential administrations alike have advanced the national security implications of climate change, Nevitt said.\n\nUnder the late President George H.W. Bush, a Republican who worked as a businessman in the oil industry, the Navy War College found in 1990 that naval operations could be “drastically affected” by global climate change. The following year President Bush said climate change respected no international boundaries and was already contributing to political conflict.\n\nAfter General Jim Mattis was appointed defense secretary during President Trump’s first term, the retired four-star general who commanded Marines in the Persian Gulf and Afghanistan, one of the regions warming faster than others, said: “Climate change is impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating today.”\n\nSecurity experts describe several key areas where climate change plays a role in national and international security.\n\nA new frontier - the Arctic Ocean\n\nGiven the melting sea ice in the Arctic Ocean, the Bering Strait is gaining strategic importance and demands a stronger U.S. presence, according to numerous reports by and for the military.\n\nThe Arctic presents a whole new potential, Nevitt said. “Natural resources open up for extraction and Russia is heavily militarized in the Arctic, much more so than we are,” he said. “Russia has more military bases in the Arctic and more capacity there than the U.S.,” he said.\n\nEven though the Arctic is warming enough that a security presence is required, Ellison said conditions are still dangerously cold for troops who must survive there.\n\nThreats in the Pacific\n\nSome vulnerable U.S. allies in the Pacific “already consider climate change their number one national security threat,” Ellison said. “Are we not going to engage on the priorities of those allies?”\n\nCountries like Kiribati and Tuvalu could lose their statehood if their physical territory is underwater or uninhabitable because saltwater gets into freshwater drinking supplies, he said. “People who have lived there for millennia could no longer live there.”\n\nAn even bigger issue is when the U.S. military is called to respond when natural disasters strike in countries in the Indo-Pacific region. If the military stops responding, he said, “there’s a concern that there could be other nations that would fill that gap role if the U.S. military was not doing that. The most obvious would be China.”\n\nThreats to bases and troops\n\nDefense department property holdings around the world are valued at nearly $1.2 trillion, according to a 2019 Governmental Accounting Office report.\n\nOne 2018 federal study found a three-foot rise in sea levels by 2100 would threaten operations at more than 128 of those U.S. military sites.\n\nGuardians of the sea for more than 200 years, the U.S. Navy already increasingly battles the ocean. Sea level has risen 1.06 feet at the Naval Academy at Annapolis since 1929, according to federal data, and the department has projected it could rise at least another foot by 2065 and more than two additional feet by 2100.\n\nAt Sewell’s Point, 150 miles to the south, the sea rises even faster and could rise more than a foot by 2050, according to Navy projections. Like Nevitt, for years now, people traveling to the bases during high tide events have had to take alternate routes.\n\n“Climate resilience for our bases has been an issue of bipartisan support for more than a decade, including during the first Trump presidency,” said Sherri Goodman, who served as the deputy undersecretary of defense for environmental security in the 1990s and wrote the book “Threat Multiplier: Climate, Military Leadership, and the Fight for Global Security.”\n\nIt doesn’t make sense for the Department of Defense “to ignore a clear, evident risk,” Goodman said. “If we fail to manage risks that impose burdens and costs on our military, we will suffer the consequences, and the Chinese will benefit from it.”\n\nAfter Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida’s Panhandle was ravaged by Hurricane Michael in October 2018, Goodman said the Florida congressional delegation was “very clear they wanted that base to be built back better.”\n\nNow it’s “the Air Force resilient base of the future,” she said, with “hangars able to withstand the highest wind speeds.”\n\nClimate change also affects the individual safety of members of the military, whether it’s extreme heat in the middle East or extreme cold exposures while establishing a stronger presence in the Arctic.\n\n“What the Secretary of Defense is doing now is putting our troops more in harm’s way,” Goodman said. “If we don’t make our troops and infrastructure and bases more resilient, we’re just giving it away to the enemies.”\n\nThe military could call climate change whatever they want to, Young said. “Talk about heat, talk about flood, talk about erosion, but for goodness’ sake don’t hamper DOD’s ability to protect their infrastructure.”\n\nContributing: Elizabeth Weise, USA TODAY"

        "full_text": "A divided Supreme Court sided with the Trump administration by allowing officials to block $65 million in teacher development grants frozen over concerns they were promoting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) practices.\n\nThe 5-4 emergency ruling, for now, lifts a lower order that forced the Education Department to resume the grants in eight Democratic-led states that are suing.\n\nFive of the court’s six conservatives sided with the administration to grant the request. Chief Justice John Roberts and the court’s three liberal justices dissented.\n\nThe decision is not a final ruling in the case, and the dispute could ultimately return to the Supreme Court. Friday’s order enables the administration to keep the grants blocked until any appeals are resolved.\n\n“Respondents have represented in this litigation that they have the financial wherewithal to keep their programs running. So, if respondents ultimately prevail, they can recover any wrongfully withheld funds through suit in an appropriate forum,” the majority said it its unsigned ruling.\n\nIn February, the administration began canceling disbursements under two federal education grants aimed at developing educators and combatting teacher shortages: the Teacher Quality Partnership Program and the Supporting Effective Educator Development Program.\n\nOfficials have cast the freezes as part of the administration’s broader crackdown on DEI, and it also comes as Trump and Education Secretary Linda McMahon look to effectively gut the department.\n\nU.S. District Judge Myong Joun, an appointee of former President Obama who serves in Boston, issued a March 10 temporary restraining order mandating the administration immediately resume the grant programs in the eight states.\n\nThe Trump administration’s Supreme Court emergency appeal comes after a three-judge panel on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to lift Joun’s ruling.\n\nThe chief justice did not explain his dissent, but the court’s three liberals chastised the majority for getting involved at the early stage of the case.\n\n“The risk of error increases when this Court decides cases—as here—with barebones briefing, no argument, and scarce time for reflection,” Justice Elena Kagan wrote in a two-paragraph solo dissent.\n\n“Sometimes, the Court must act in that way despite the risk. And there will of course be good-faith disagreements about when that is called for,” she continued. “But in my view, nothing about this case demanded our immediate intervention. Rather than make new law on our emergency docket, we should have allowed the dispute to proceed in the ordinary way.”\n\nIn a much lengthier dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, said it was “beyond puzzling” that the majority viewed the dispute as an emergency.\n\n“This Court’s eagerness to insert itself into this early stage of ongoing litigation over the lawfulness of the Department’s actions—even when doing so facilitates the infliction of significant harms on the Plaintiff States, and even though the Government has not bothered to press any argument that the Department’s harm‐causing conduct is lawful—is equal parts unprincipled and unfortunate. It is also entirely unwarranted,” Jackson wrote.\n\nThe administration has filed a series of such emergency applications urging the justices to rein in lower courts that have blocked Trump’s policies.\n\n“Beyond the systemic, irreparable constitutional harm to the Executive Branch from judicial arrogation of executive functions as to how and when agencies will disburse or cancel grants, even the court of appeals acknowledged that the government ‘may incur some irreparable harm if it cannot recoup this money,’” the Justice Department wrote in court filings.\n\nThe states, whose lawsuit alleges applicable regulations don’t permit the administration to stop the grant programs, noted the lower ruling is temporary and normally not appealable.\n\n“The district court acted appropriately in granting a narrow and time-limited restraining order while it proceeds to a prompt ruling on the motion for a preliminary injunction. There is no sound basis for this Court to stay or vacate that order,” the states wrote.\n\nLed by California, the coalition also comprises Massachusetts, New Jersey, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York and Wisconsin.\n\nTheir lawsuit now returns to the trial court, where Joun is mulling whether to grant a longer injunction after holding a hearing last Friday. But the five justices in the majority cast doubt on the future of the lawsuit, saying Joun lacks jurisdiction.\n\nAnd it is just one of two lawsuits challenging the frozen teacher grants. A similar case filed by private education groups remains at a midlevel appeals court.\n\nThe new ruling marks the Supreme Court’s second emergency decision implicating the second Trump administration’s sweeping efforts to cut aspects of federal spending.\n\nIn March, the court in a 5-4 decision rejected the administration’s request to freeze $2 billion in foreign aid payments.\n\nUpdated 5:04 p.m. EDT"

        "full_text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Federal prosecutors on Friday added two charges to Sean “Diddy” Combs ' indictment and said they expect four accusers to testify against him, expanding on allegations that the jailed hip-hop mogul engaged in sex trafficking with multiple women and as recently as last year.\n\nA superseding indictment accuses Combs of using force, fraud or coercion to compel a woman to engage in commercial sex acts from at least 2021 to 2024.\n\nThe indictment, returned by a federal grand jury in Manhattan, also alleges that Combs was involved in transporting the woman — identified only as “Victim-2” — and other people, including commercial sex workers, to engage in prostitution during the same period.\n\nThe new charges are in addition to racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges filed against Combs when he was arrested in September. They increase the total number of charges against him from three to five.\n\nIn a court filing, federal prosecutors said the racketeering conspiracy charge involves allegations that Combs sex-trafficked three victims and forced a fourth, one of his employees, into sexual activity with him.\n\nCombs, 55, denies committing any crimes. He is scheduled to stand trial May 5 and remains locked up without bail at a federal jail in Brooklyn.\n\n“These are not new allegations or new accusers. These are the same individuals, former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships,” Combs’ legal team said in a statement. “This was their private sex life, defined by consent, not coercion.”\n\nFriday’s superseding indictment is the third filed against Combs.\n\nIn the first, in January, federal prosecutors disclosed that their case involved at least three women whom they said Combs forced to engage in commercial sex acts. They also alleged Combs showed a firearm to a female victim during a kidnapping and once dangled a woman over an apartment balcony.\n\nCombs’ January indictment didn’t include additional charges but modified some details of the existing ones, including adding four years to the alleged racketeering conspiracy. Prosecutors now say it started in 2004, not 2008 as the original indictment had alleged. A superseding indictment in March contained minimal changes.\n\nCombs has pleaded not guilty to the first set of charges, which allege that he coerced and abused women for years with help from a network of associates and employees while silencing victims through blackmail and violence, including kidnapping, arson and physical beatings.\n\nHis arraignment on the new charges has not been scheduled. Prosecutors asked Friday that it be held at his final pretrial conference on April 25.\n\nIn their filing Friday, prosecutors said three of the four accusers who are expected to testify have asked that their identities not be revealed to the press or the public and that they instead be referred to by at trial using only pseudonyms.\n\nThe accuser referred to as “Victim-1” in Combs’ charging documents is prepared to testify under her own name, prosecutors said in the filing, which was heavily redacted.\n\nFederal prosecutors allege the “I’ll Be Missing You” singer and Bad Boy Records founder used his “power and prestige” as a music star to induce female victims into drugged-up, elaborately produced sexual performances with male sex workers in events dubbed “Freak Offs.”\n\nCentral to the case is a March 2016 video showing Combs hitting and kicking his then-girlfriend, R&B singer Cassie, in a Los Angeles hotel hallway. Prosecutors contend the assault happened during a “Freak Off.” Combs lawyers argue the footage was nothing more than a “glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship” between the two.\n\nCombs’ lawyers contend the case should never have been brought and are fighting to dismiss a charge involving allegations he transported a male escort across state lines.\n\n“The government has concocted a criminal case based primarily on allegations that Mr. Combs and two of his longtime girlfriends sometimes brought a third party — a male escort — into their sexual relationship,” Combs lawyer Alexandra A.E. Shapiro wrote in a February court filing.\n\n“Each of the three charges in the case are premised on the theory that this type of sexual activity is a federal crime,” Shapiro added."

        "full_text": "X is not real life, but its tentacles slither into the increasingly online landscape that defines real life. It’s not X’s fault; it has merely become an incubator of a trend launched years ago by the 24-hour news cycle. Really, then, much of our modern malaise is the fault of Ted Turner, a man so wise he saw fit to marry Jane Fonda in 1991, well after she had publicly aired her crazy in myriad ways.\n\nAnd while information is good, there’s only so much of it that comes out in a day, which leaves lots of hours left to fill. Hence, the terrain quickly shifted from constant news to constant hysteria. Which is fine, if toting a fainting couch around with you is your thing, but there’s really no need to live this way. Take, for example, the latest outrage to animate us all: President Trump’s tariffs.\n\nWhether the tariffs are good, bad, or somewhere in between is immaterial. At the very least, they provide comedic relief in the form of a 10 percent tariff on the Heard and McDonald Islands, an Australian territory occupied primarily by penguins. It also has active volcanoes, which is not something we should want imported, though, so perhaps the tariffs are good. On the other hand, maybe we do need more penguins and the tariff will hinder the supply. In either case, I’m withholding umbrage.\n\nIn this scenario, more people should be like me. It is unhealthy to spend so much time worrying about the daily stories that percolate on X before dripping out into the mainstream, making people panic about world war, their 401(k), or the manufactured stories that provide outrage on slower news days. This is where the concept of touching grass, a meme that remains important even as its popularity has waned, was borne. It is wholly unnecessary to be bothered by every gyration of the world.\n\nBack to the tariffs, markets, and 401(k)s, a long-held rule of investing is that you shouldn’t pay attention to the daily movements. In the world spawned by the 24-hour cycle, it’s oh so tempting to do so, and it can make for great online dunks to point out that the Nasdaq, S&P, and Dow are down, but when one zooms out to longer timelines, the pictures look much different.\n\nSuch trends are boring, if comforting, though, so we tend not to discuss those, instead focusing on histrionic proclamations about oncoming destruction of biblical proportions. Debate is fun, and it’s important to discuss policy, but it’s also important to remember to stay in one’s lane.\n\nTo take an example from my own life, I recently completed coursework to become a real estate agent. Among the things I learned was that not every agent is a realtor, a designation that requires one to fill out some paperwork and pay dues, as with so many titles in life. (Will I do that? Undoubtedly, because they have good marketing, and I don’t want to confuse normal people who don’t know there’s a distinction.) The other big thing I learned, beyond a bunch of legal definitions about tenancy that I will never need in my life, is to steadfastly refuse to step outside my scope of expertise. The practice test was littered with questions to which the proper answer was, “You should talk to an attorney about that.”\n\nIn 24-hour newsrooms and especially on social media, almost no one is responding with, “You should consult an expert about this topic.” This is not helped by the fact that many experts are anything but. Naturally, this does not lessen the collective alarm brought on by the outrage du jour but instead intensifies it.\n\nMaybe, then, we should not allow ourselves to get sucked into the panics! sprawling before us every day. Being opposed to things isn’t a personality any more than being in favor of them is. Cultivate real hobbies, talk to your neighbors, take a walk without headphones, go fishing. Do something, anything, besides falling for the world Ted Turner built. For he is a man who not only married Jane Fonda when she was well past her prime but also donated $1 billion (!) in support of the decrepit terror sponsors at the United Nations.\n\nThat he convinced people the best way to save an endangered species is to eat it is not enough to cancel out those more destructive tendencies, ones that are currently making us spend too much time yelling at one another."

        "full_text": "A federal judge on Friday ruled that the United States must bring back a man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador last month.\n\nJudge Paula Xinis of the US District Court in Maryland directed the federal government to return Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, to the US no later than 11:59 p.m. on April 7.\n\nThe Trump administration conceded in a court filing Monday it mistakenly deported the Maryland father of three “because of an administrative error,” but said it could not bring him back because he is in Salvadoran custody. It appeared to mark the first time the administration has admitted an error related to its recent deportation flights to El Salvador, which are now at the center of a fraught legal battle.\n\n“This case is certainly important to Abrego Garcia and his family,” the judge said. “In recognition of that. I feel like I can’t wait on giving my order.”\n\nOver the course of the hearing, Xinis had repeatedly raised issues with Abrego Garcia’s removal to El Salvador, given that an immigration judge had previously granted him withholding of removal, meaning he could suffer persecution if removed from the US to El Salvador. He was still considered removable; it just couldn’t be to El Salvador. Xinis cited that status in her ruling, saying Abrego Garcia was apprehended last month “without legal basis” and deported “without justification of legal basis.”\n\n“This was an illegal act,” Xinis said. “Congress said you can’t do it, and you did it anyway.”\n\nDepartment of Justice attorney Erez Reuveni conceded to Abrego Garcia’s attorneys’ arguments that he should not have been deported to El Salvador, saying, “Our only arguments are jurisdictional … he should not have been sent to El Salvador.”\n\nXinis, an Obama appointee, questioned why the US could not bring Abrego Garcia back, given the US’ $6 million contract with the El Salvadorian prison facility, the Center for Terrorism Confinement.\n\n“Why can’t the United States get Mr. Abrego Garcia back?” Xinis asked.\n\n“The first thing I did when I got this case on my desk is ask my clients the same question,” Reuveni responded, but he said that he did not get a direct answer.\n\n“All of this points to a functional control and that if the United States as a contracted party can have functional control of the placement, the wrongful placement, they certainly have the functional control of the return,” Xinis said. Reuveni called his own lack of information on why the US couldn’t bring bring him back “frustrating,” but added, “The United States can’t call someone in El Salvador, have them pick up the phone and say ‘give us our guy back.’”\n\nThe DOJ lawyer appeared to suggest that he had asked the government to return Abrego Garcia, but they did not heed his advice. He then asked the judge for 24 hours to go back to the DOJ, but it was unclear exactly what this request was for.\n\nSimon Sandoval-Moshenberg, the lawyer for Abrego Garcia, asked for the court to order his client’s return to the US, saying he isn’t asking for “micro-managing” by the court, but that the government be “put on a leash” to ensure this is done in a timely manner. “At least today, it doesn’t seem like they’re taking it seriously,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said after Reuveni’s arguments before the bench.\n\nDuring the hearing, Xinis also appeared skeptical about Abrego Garcia’s alleged ties to the MS-13 gang, which Trump officials have maintained, saying that she had not seen sufficient evidence to that effect.\n\n“When someone is accused of membership in such a violent and predatory organization, it comes in the form of an indictment, complaint, criminal proceeding that has a robust process,” she said.\n\nThe Justice Department didn’t provide additional evidence beyond what’s already been submitted in the case. “The government made a choice here to produce no evidence,” DOJ attorney Erez Reuveni told the judge.\n\nThe Trump administration later Friday appealed the judge’s ruling, according to a court filing. The case has been appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\n\nTrump’s aggressive immigration push\n\nSince taking office, President Donald Trump and his team have taken extraordinary measures to crack down on immigration, including invoking a rarely used wartime authority, known as the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, that has pitted the administration against another federal judge and prompted public backlash.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration has made multiple missteps in recent weeks, including deporting Abrego Garcia. The errors kept happening despite federal agents assuring they are carefully vetting each person before putting them on flights to a notorious prison in El Salvador.\n\nStephen Miller, Trump’s White House deputy chief of staff, on Friday called Xinis a “Marxist judge” who “now thinks she’s president of El Salvador.”\n\n“Marxist judge now thinks she’s president of El Salvador,” Miller wrote in a post on X.\n\nIn a news conference Friday outside the courthouse, Jennifer, the wife of Abrego Garcia, said that she will “continue fighting for Kilmar.” Sandoval-Moshenberg expressed concern about whether the government would comply with Xinis’ order.\n\n“I really, sincerely hope that [the government] will abide by that order and walk away from this case and leave well enough alone. They do not need to appeal this decision. They do not need to seek a stay. They should simply obey the judge’s order, bring him back to the United States by Monday,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said. “An apology would be nice, but I am not expecting that.”\n\nAfter the news conference, Sandoval-Moshenberg told CNN, “I’m a lawyer, I have to assume initially that they will comply with the judge’s order unless it is stayed by a higher court. If they don’t, we will be right back here asking the judge to enforce her order.”\n\nThe attorney also cast doubt on the government’s notion that they cannot bring Abrego Garcia home, alluding to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s visit to Cecot earlier this week.\n\n“I don’t see how they can even plausibly argue that there’s no capacity to bring someone back,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said “Maybe they could have made that argument prior to Wednesday of last week, but as soon as they put Kristi Noem within the walls of that prison, they really kneecap their argument to say that they can’t get someone out of that prison — because they got Kristi Noem out of that prison.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\n\nCNN’s Samantha Waldenberg contributed to this story."

        "full_text": "WASHINGTON, D.C. — Economic issues continue to dominate Americans’ national concerns, with majorities expressing “a great deal” of personal worry about the economy, healthcare availability and affordability, inflation and the federal budget deficit. Along with the economy and healthcare, public concern about Social Security and the environment is up significantly, with Social Security registering a 15-year high.\n\nAt the same time, concern about crime, drug use, immigration, and the availability and affordability of energy has decreased when the last measure of President Joe Biden’s term in 2024 is compared with the first measure of President Donald Trump’s second term this year.\n\nAfter the change in presidential administrations, partisans’ worries have shifted significantly on most of the 16 issues Gallup measured, as Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents have become more concerned, while Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are less worried.\n\nEconomic Issues Top List of Americans’ Worries\n\nAmericans’ top-ranking worries are pocketbook issues, including the economy (60% worry a great deal), healthcare costs (59%), inflation (56%), federal spending and the budget deficit (53%), and the Social Security system (52%).\n\nMeanwhile, half of Americans are greatly worried about hunger and homelessness, and 48% each are concerned about the way income and wealth are distributed in the U.S. and the size and power of the federal government.\n\nCrime and violence, the quality of the environment, a possible terrorist attack on the U.S., illegal immigration and drug use are toward the bottom of the list, while Americans exhibit the lowest concern about unemployment, the availability and affordability of energy, and race relations. Race relations, the issue evoking the least amount of worry, has been declining since it peaked at 48% in 2021.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nInflation and the economy have been uppermost worries since 2022, but healthcare has not ranked at the top of the list since 2020 (at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the last year of Trump’s first term).\n\nTwelve of the 16 issues (all but inflation, the federal budget deficit, income and wealth distribution, and the federal government’s size and power) included in Gallup’s latest poll, conducted March 3-16, have been tracked annually since 2005. An average 45% of Americans worry a great deal about these 12 issues in 2025. This is the third consecutive reading of this measure that matches the high point in the trend, which was first recorded in 2011.\n\nWorry About Economy, Healthcare, Social Security, Environment Has Increased\n\nHigh-level worry about the economy, healthcare and Social Security has risen by eight or nine percentage points since last year, and concern about the environment is up six points. In contrast, concerns about energy (-13 points), immigration (-8 points), crime and drug use (-6 points each) have decreased. Meanwhile, Americans’ worries about federal spending, inflation, hunger and homelessness, race relations, unemployment, and terrorism are relatively steady. Federal government size/power and income/wealth distribution were not asked about in 2024.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nDemocrats’ Worries Increase Across the Board, as Republicans’ Ease\n\nThe degree to which Democrats and Republicans worry about many issues has differed, with each group generally worrying more when the sitting president is from the opposing political party and less when a president of their own party is in the White House. This pattern has been particularly evident since 2017.\n\nDemocrats and Democratic-leaning independents and Republicans and Republican leaners express significantly different degrees of worry on all issues except the possibility of a terrorist attack in the U.S. Republicans are more worried than Democrats about the federal budget deficit, crime, illegal immigration, drug use, and the size and power of the federal government. Democrats express more worry than Republicans on every other issue.\n\nAs Trump has replaced Biden, Democrats have become significantly more worried about 10 of the 14 issues measured last year, while Republicans have become less worried about 12. The steepest drops in Republican concern are seen for inflation (-18 points), possible U.S. terrorist attacks (-17 points), the economy and energy affordability (-16 points each).\n\nThe only issue on which Republican concern did not decrease was healthcare availability and affordability, though it remains a lower priority overall for that group compared with Democrats and is roughly on par with last year’s reading.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nBottom Line\n\nAmericans’ top worries remain firmly rooted in economic insecurity, with the economy, healthcare affordability, inflation and the federal budget deficit atop the list of problems they worry about a lot. Social Security also ranks high after worry increased sharply from 2024. Environmental concern rose because of an increase among Democrats and Democratic leaners, while worry about crime and drug use declined modestly. Meanwhile, sharp partisan differences over immigration, the environment and income inequality point to continued polarization on several major policy fronts.\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on X @Gallup.\n\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.\n\nView complete question responses and trends (PDF download).\n\n###Embeddable###"

        "full_text": "President Donald Trump’s administration is posting sadistic memes on its social media accounts to prompt the public to cruelly laugh at migrants caught up in his mass deportation obsession. For example, last week, the White House X account exploited a new ChatGPT feature that allows users to transform images “into the style of Studio Ghibli,” the beloved animation studio, and posted a cartoon version of a posted photo of a crying undocumented migrant in handcuffs. The responses to the post were a mix of delight from supporters and horror from critics, and the practice illustrates how Trump knows he must dehumanize migrants to justify his aggressive and increasingly extralegal efforts to deport them.\n\nTrump couches his messages in seemingly unserious or “comical” aesthetics online to downplay how sinister they are. As I’ve written in the past, Trump uses humor as a weapon, in part by dressing up his violations of norms and degradation of his opponents as a joke.\n\nThe White House chose an unsympathetic subject for its Studio Ghibli-style meme — a migrant who reportedly had been deported in the past after pleading guilty to attempted possession with intent to distribute fentanyl. But regardless of what that person did or where one stands on this particular deportation or deportations in general — brandishing people’s pain as a political message is not a defense of policy. Trump’s propaganda reveals that he delights in the pain of others, and he encourages the public to laugh with him.\n\nTrump’s social media team is making performative sadism a full-fledged comms strategy. In February the White House posted a video of migrants being deported with the text “ASMR: Illegal Alien Deportation Flight.\" The “joke” is that the viewer is supposed to find it soothing to hear the sounds of the jangling of handcuffs and chains on migrants and the starting rumble of the plane that will deport them. On Feb. 14, above an image that looked like a valentine with Trump’s and White House border czar Tom Homan’s heads surrounded by hearts, Trump posted, “Roses are red, violets are blue, come here illegally, and we’ll deport you,”\n\nTrump’s friends have struck similar notes. El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele created a disturbing three-minute propaganda video, which he released after Trump initially deported alleged Venezuelan gang members to a brutal prison in his country. Operating in a similar emotional register as Trump’s memes, Bukele’s video depicts the brutalization of prisoners as part of an exciting action sequence and revels in an authoritarian aesthetic in its depiction of phalanxes of police officers. It’s easy to see why Trump and Bukele are natural partners on this issue. Each of them takes pleasure in seeing others publicly humiliated."

Kennedy Jr., now serving as Secretary of Health and Human Services under President Donald Trump, continues to face renewed scrutiny over his use of testosterone replacement therapy—an anabolic steroid—after posting a series of shirtless workout videos that went viral and reignited earlier claims he was using performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nThe controversy, first sparked in mid-2023 following a viral video of Kennedy doing push-ups outside Gold's Gym in Venice, California, has resurfaced thanks to social media chatter and commentary from high-profile fitness figures like Greg Doucette. Doucette's recent YouTube video—titled \"Steroids! RFK Isn't Fooling Anyone...\"—recirculated the claims, pushing the topic back into the national spotlight as Kennedy now oversees U.S. health policy and drug regulation.\n\nThe Claim\n\nGreg Doucette is a professional bodybuilder and a world-record powerlifter who also runs a YouTube channel with 2.26 million subscribers. In a video posted on March 20, Doucette discussed whether or not Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had taken steroids.\n\n\"The reason he looks like this is not because of the vitamins,\" Doucette said in the video. \"It's not because he doesn't consume pesticides. It doesn't have anything to do with this. It's because he trains harder than last time, and he's on test, [also known as] steroids.\"\n\nAs of publishing, the video has gotten over 137,000 views.\n\nThe Facts\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. has publicly acknowledged using testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), a medically approved treatment often prescribed to older men with low testosterone levels. Testosterone replacement therapy involves administering testosterone—typically via injections, patches, or gels—to restore hormone levels to a normal range.\n\nAccording to an article published by WebMD, \"doses of testosterone used in TRT are small, designed to achieve natural levels of the hormone in the blood.\" Though still a steroid, it's only abused when athletes use doses as much as 10 to 100 times higher than those given medically, WebMD reports. The article goes on to say that this steroid is often \"stacked\" with others to further enhance building muscle.\n\nKennedy has denied taking any steroids but confirmed taking testosterone replacement therapy as part of an \"anti-aging protocol\" from his doctor, the New York Times reported in 2024.\n\nDespite Kennedy's repeated denials of using \"anabolic steroids,\" testosterone itself is legally classified as an anabolic steroid under the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 1990. As WebMD explains, TRT can lead to improved muscle mass, increased energy, and reduced fat in men with clinically low testosterone. These benefits help maintain a more muscular physique, particularly in aging men, making it likely that TRT contributes to Kennedy's visible fitness.\n\nHowever, while therapeutic when used under medical supervision, testosterone's classification as a steroid means Kennedy's claim of not using anabolic steroids is technically incorrect.\n\nSo, how much does TRT actually influence Kennedy's physique? According to Doucette, his diet and workout routine likely play a larger role in building and maintaining his muscle mass than the hormone therapy alone.\n\n\"I don't care how many of [the vitamins] he's taking, if he's not fat, it's because he's exercising or not eating too many calories,\" Doucette said in the YouTube video.\n\nThe Ruling\n\nNeeds Context.\n\nFACT CHECK BY Newsweek's Fact Check team"

The islands are also home to other animals including seals, flying birds and invertebrates — but no humans.\n\nFollowing U.S. President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs announcement on April 2, 2025, a claim (archived) circulated that the countries hit by Trump's reciprocal tariffs included an island inhabited only by penguins.\n\nOne X user wrote: \"The Trump administration has put a 10 percent tariff on the Heard Island and McDonald which has a population of 0 people and is inhabited only by penguins.\"\n\nThe claim spread across Facebook (archived), X (archived), Threads (archived), Bluesky (archived) and Reddit (archived).\n\nThe claim pertained to the Heard Island and McDonald Islands (HIMI), an uninhabited island group that is part of the external territory of Australia and located near Antarctica. The islands are home to penguins, seals and, according to the CIA World Factbook and the Australian government, no humans.\n\nThe Trump administration's tariffs list (archived), posted on the White House X account, did indeed include the \"Heard and McDonald Islands,\" which were hit with 10% \"discounted reciprocal\" tariffs. Therefore, we rate this claim true.\n\nWe reached out to the White House to ask why an island group with no human inhabitants was included on its tariffs list. We also asked why HIMI was listed separately from Australia, given the island group's classification as Australian territory and the fact that \"mainland\" Australia and HIMI were hit with the same 10% tariffs. We await the White House's reply.\n\nWe also reached out to the Australian Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet for its latest comment on the HIMI tariffs and await a reply.\n\nAccording to UNESCO, which includes the island group on its World Heritage List of locations with \"outstanding universal value\":\n\nThe distinctive conservation value of Heard and McDonald – one of the world's rare pristine island ecosystems – lies in the complete absence of alien plants and animals, as well as human impact.\n\nThe Australian government also highlighted the care taken to minimize human impact on the island group. According to the government website:\n\nSince the first landing on Heard Island in 1855, there have been only approximately 240 shore-based visits to the island, and only two landings on McDonald Island (in 1971 and 1980).\n\nIn lieu of humans, the island's inhabitants include flying birds, penguins, seals and invertebrates. Penguins are the most abundant birds on the islands.\n\nDespite this, import and export figures from the World Bank reported by the Guardian appeared to show that the U.S. imported $1.4 million worth of goods from HIMI in 2022. Almost all of the imported goods were classed as \"mach and electric.\" It was not clear from the World Bank figures what specific products were imported by the U.S.\n\nTrump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs list included more than 180 countries and territories. The tariffs were due to take effect immediately after they were announced on April 2, 2025."

        "full_text": "The administration of President Donald Trump promised big changes to the status quo in short order when it re-took the White House last November.\n\nAnd as far as the U.S. Army goes, it appears to be doing just that.\n\nNow under the purview of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, a report has surfaced that the military “is quietly considering a sweeping reduction of up to 90,000 active-duty troops,” according to Military.com.\n\n“[T]hree defense officials familiar with the deliberations” have cited pressure from the Pentagon to cut expenditures, as well as a general move away from spending military resources in Europe, as the reasons for this potentially drastic action.\n\nAs far as the Pentagon goes, that group appears to be working on an order from Hegseth, who demanded that it cut 8 percent from the budget.\n\nHegseth has specifically targeted leftist programs, such as climate change, as ones to cut at the Pentagon, but as Military.com noted, “Eliminating such programs alone would not yield anywhere close to 8 percent savings, making reductions in combat forces likely unavoidable.”\n\nThe current number of troops sits at roughly 450,000, and top officials are reportedly looking to bring that figure down to anywhere from 360,000 to 420,000.\n\nThe concerns of European involvement, meanwhile, come from the very top down.\n\nBoth President Donald Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance have been critical of various aspects of America’s relationship with Europe, especially when it comes to armed conflict.\n\nTrump has gone on record to criticize NATO and European nations for not paying their fair share for what virtually amounts to year-around American protection.\n\nVance, meanwhile, has just generally been resistant to America’s involvement in any conflict abroad.\n\nStars and Stripes also reported that the Army is slashing and/or merging training programs to streamline it, marking another cut and change to the military under Hegseth.\n\nBut perhaps no change for the military got more national attention than when Hegseth announced that he’s ordering combat readiness standards to be the same for both men and women on Monday.\n\n“For far too long, we have allowed standards to slip,” Hegseth posted to X. “We’ve had different standards for men/women serving in combat arms MOS’s and jobs….\n\n“That’s not acceptable, and it changes right now!”\n\nAdvertise with The Western Journal and reach millions of highly engaged readers, while supporting our work.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is part of DHS.\n\nAbrego Garcia's lawyer Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said, despite the mistake, no government efforts have been made to return Abrego Garcia to the United States.\n\n\"Every other time that that happened, as soon as I essentially convinced them that they messed up. Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, bent over backward to try to fix it. Right now, they haven't taken a single step.\"\n\nHe was sent to El Salvador in a deal to pay El Salvador $6 million to house deported migrants, authorities in the Central American nation said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Justice Department attorney said there was no contract.\n\n\"The way I see the record, though, is that there is an agreement between your clients and El Salvador where you clients are [paying] upward of $6 million to house individuals,\" the judge said. \"There's nothing to suggest that they're still not in the custody of DHS and immigration.\"\n\nThe U.S. government has acknowledged there was an \"administrative error\" and an \"oversight,\" but because he no longer is in U.S. custody, the court can't order him to be returned to the United States, nor can a judge order El Salavador to return him, according to a filing earlier.\n\n\"This case is certainly important to Abrego Garcia and his family,\" the judge said. \"In recognition of that, I feel like I can't wait on giving my order.\"\n\nAbrego Garcia's wife, Jennifer Stefania Vasquez Sura, a U.S. citizen, tearfully spoke to her imprisoned husband while addressing reporters ahead of Friday's hearing.\n\n\"Kilmar, if you can hear me, I miss you so much,\" she said. \"And I'm doing the best to fight for you and our children.\n\nAfter the hearing, she said that \"we will continue this fight to get my husband back.\"\n\nIn a Monday statement ICE field office director Robert Cerna said the removal of Garcia \"was an error.\"\n\nAttorneys for Abrego Garcia have said that he is not a member of \"Tren de Aragua, MS-13, or any other criminal street gang\" and fled El Salvador to the United States to escape gang violence, adding the Trump administration has not been able to produce \"an iota of evidence\" proving he is a gang member.\n\nThe administration has countered that Abrego Garcia \"had the opportunity to give evidence tending to show he was not part of MS-13, which he did not proffer.\"\n\nXinis said she hadn't seen sufficient evidence he is a member of the gang."

        "full_text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Energy Department has identified thousands of federal workers it deems “nonessential” and would not be protected if there is another round of large-scale firings, according to a document obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nThe jobs at risk include more than 8,500 positions across the Energy Department and the National Nuclear Security Administration — which upgrades and maintains the nation’s nuclear warheads. The department identified them as eligible to be cut to meet the goals of President Donald Trump’s executive order for mass reductions in federal employees.\n\nIt was not clear if every position identified as nonessential would be eliminated. All federal agencies had until March 13 to identify what departments and positions could be consolidated in a planning process to streamline the agencies and ready them for potential “large scale reductions in force,” Trump’s Feb. 26 order directed.\n\nAsked if large-scale firings are coming, the Energy Department, through spokesperson Ben Dietderich, said multiple plans are being considered and no final decisions have been made.\n\nSen. Patty Murray of Washington and Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio said gutting the department would raise energy costs for families and businesses, slow innovation and put national and global security at risk.\n\n“It is extremely concerning that the department is reportedly considering firing the very experts tasked with maintaining a safe, secure and reliable nuclear weapons stockpile,” the two Democrats said in a joint statement to The Associated Press. “These dangerous cuts should not transpire. We call for this foolishness to be set aside.”\n\nThere are about 17,500 federal positions within the department, which has a wide range of responsibilities beyond those for nuclear weapons. It also operates hydroelectric dams, cleans up contaminated radioactive waste sites, maintains and modernizes the power grid and provides grants for things like home weatherization. Only 9,004 of those positions were deemed essential, according to the document.\n\nThe majority of the employees within the National Nuclear Security Administration were deemed essential, according to the document. The majority of the national labs operated by the Energy Department are run by contractors and also would not be affected.\n\nIn February, the Trump administration ended up scrambling to reinstate hundreds of National Nuclear Security Administration employees who were laid off by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency after it became apparent many were directly supporting nuclear weapons management.\n\nAbout 3,000 employees at the Energy Department work directly for the nuclear security agency, which manages national security complexes nationwide where nuclear weapons material and warhead components are stored and refurbished to maintain the nuclear weapons stockpile.\n\nAccording to the document, about 500 positions at the nuclear security agency and about 8,000 jobs across the Energy Department were deemed nonessential. Some of those have already been reduced through deferred resignations.\n\nEnergy Secretary Chris Wright has said the department grew too big during the Biden administration in the last four years and now he’s right-sizing it. He acknowledged publicly that it was a mistake to lay off the nuclear security agency workers in February.\n\nUnlike some of the other federal agencies where cuts have left a deep impact on employment in the national capital region, much of the Energy Department’s workforce is scattered throughout the country in different energy sectors.\n\nAn earlier round targeted probationary employees but was thrown out by a federal judge."

        "full_text": "With Donald Trump back in office, freedom of speech is back in vogue. Vox, which put the word “censorship” in quotation marks in Biden-era coverage, is decrying Trump’s “assault” on the First Amendment. The same Washington Post that ignored years of censorship controversies is (hilariously) just now running “What to know about First Amendment rights” pieces. Looking down the business end of censorship threats seems to have inspired everyone in the press to get civil liberties religion.\n\nAlmost everyone, that is. From Jessica Karl at Bloomberg, in “Everyone Has a Substack. What Could Possibly Go Wrong?”:\n\nI’m by no means advocating for mass censorship, but there must be a greater focus on veracity to ensure the platform doesn’t become a vessel for misleading narratives… Media professionals… are leaving traditional outlets and establishing a foothold on Substack... Do they want their work to exist in a space that also houses an unverified hit piece by an anti-Semite? Probably not.\n\nIn 2022, the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate revealed that Substack generated $2.5 million a year from anti-vax content… In December 2023, that stance was stress-tested once again when The Atlantic published an article titled “Substack Has a Nazi Problem…” Although they ended up removing five Nazi newsletters, the core policy remained unchanged.\n\nIn a polarized commercial media space, pressure has always been brought to bear on tech platforms to choose sides. Right and left long fought for influence within Google or Facebook. The anti-Substack rants that filled corporate op-ed pages for years, though, were always transparent arguments to suppress or boycott the whole platform as a thinly-veiled bigoted/conservative outpost. Of course it never was that, but this was the argument.\n\nNow, with corporate press in collapse and hordes of refugees of the Jennifer Rubin/Norm Eisen/Jim Acosta type fleeing here in the hope of monetizing last microns of name recognition, an effort is coming to sanitize the platform. I first heard months ago that some of these new arrivals were under the impression that Substack executives would feel so lucky to have them, they’d consider ridding the platform of its more disreputable riffraff. In other words, rather than simply crush an annoying independent competitor, the new argument will be about making Substack a safe space for its influx of mainstream snowflakes.\n\nI didn’t believe anyone would say this out loud until I read the Bloomberg piece. “I’m not in favor of censorship, but” has been one of the most loathsome tropes in the legacy op-ed space, but even within the genre, Karl’s piece stands out. As Beavis and Butthead would say, it’s the “ass of the ass.” Lowlights:\n\nSubscribe to Racket News to keep reading this post and get 7 days of free access to the full post archives."

        "full_text": "South Korea’s top court ended months of political turmoil when it unanimously decided to remove the impeached president Yoon Suk Yeol on Friday, clearing the way for the country to elect a new leader.\n\nBut the political crisis that Mr. Yoon triggered with his misjudged declaration of martial law in December — and his ensuing impeachment by the National Assembly — exposed a deep fissure in South Korea’s polarized politics that may prove harder to heal. For months, protesters for and against Mr. Yoon have taken over the streets in Seoul.\n\nThe country must continue without an elected leader before the elections take place, as it deals with external challenges that include the deepening military cooperation between North Korea and Russia and an upheaval in global trade ignited by President Donald J. Trump’s new tariffs.\n\nBut after months of political limbo, the ruling by the Constitutional Court on Friday finally gave South Korea a sense of direction that it has desperately needed.\n\nMr. Yoon, who had defiantly held onto his job despite his impeachment, is a former president now. In the coming days, he must vacate his hilltop presidential residence in central Seoul, and the government will schedule a national election because his successor must be chosen within 60 days. On Friday, officials lowered a presidential emblem in front of a building from where Mr. Yoon used to run the government. Military units began removing his portraits.\n\n“This is a victory for South Korean democracy,” said Sung Deuk Hahm, dean of the Graduate School of Political Studies at Kyonggi University, remembering how South Koreans had sacrificed their lives to oppose military rule in the past. “It has taken time, but this time, the rule of law eventually prevailed without blood-shedding or serious violence.”\n\nMr. Yoon’s institution of martial law, which lasted six hours until the National Assembly voted to kill it, was the first attempt by a South Korean leader to use the military as a political tool since the country began democratizing in the 1980s.\n\nHours before the ruling, supporters and opponents of Mr. Yoon gathered for rival rallies in Seoul, some camping out on the pavement overnight. As Acting Chief Justice Moon Hyungbae began reading out the 22-minute-long decision, silence fell as the crowds listened intently to every word of the ruling that would determine Mr. Yoon’s fate — and the future of South Korea’s democracy. Some clasped their hands together in prayer.\n\nWhen the verdict came, a crowd gathered near the court erupted. Those supporting Mr. Yoon’s removal reacted with screams of delight, pumping their fists into the air and hugging each other.\n\n“This is the day I’ve been waiting for over the past four months of protesting,” said Jang Jaeeuk, 21, who said he had stayed out on the street near the court overnight along with other students from his university, getting only three hours of sleep.\n\nAt a rally of supporters of Mr. Yoon, there was loud booing. Some people folded over in dismay, and others loudly cursed.\n\nYe Chung-ho, 65, had come to Seoul from Geoje Island, off the south coast of South Korea, spending two nights on the street to support Mr. Yoon.\n\n“Today marks the beginning of a true South Korea,” said Lee Jae-myung, the main opposition leader, who campaigned for Mr. Yoon’s removal. Mr. Lee is expected to win the nomination of the Democratic Party, and polls have shown that he had the strongest chance to win if a presidential election were held now. No strong front-runner has emerged in Mr. Yoon’s party.\n\nMr. Yoon thanked his supporters and apologized to the people. But he did not comment directly on the court’s ruling, only saying: “I am regretful and sorry that I could not live up to your expectations.”\n\nBut his People Power Party said it “humbly” accepted the ruling.\n\nPolitical turmoil could continue if Mr. Yoon’s hard-line supporters continue their protests. But “it won’t pose a big threat, as the People Power Party must shift its gears toward the new election,” said Ahn Byong-jin, a professor of political science at Kyung Hee University in Seoul.\n\nMr. Yoon plunged his country into its biggest political crisis in decades when he suddenly declared martial law on Dec. 3 at a time when many world leaders were busy preparing for Mr. Trump’s return to the White House. Instead of building bipartisan cooperation, he attempted to seize the National Assembly with troops, labeling the opposition “anti-state forces.” Citizens quickly mobilized to block the military takeover, giving lawmakers time to gather and vote down his martial law declaration. Mr. Yoon ended up getting impeached, leaving his country to face Mr. Trump — and North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un — under an acting president with no popular mandate.\n\n“South Korea has managed to avoid the worst outcomes and can see light at the end of a long political crisis,” Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said about Friday’s ruling. “And not a moment too soon, given how the next administration in Seoul must navigate North Korea’s military threats, China’s diplomatic pressure and Trump’s trade tariffs.”\n\nMr. Yoon’s ouster was a crushing blow to the country’s conservative camp: He was the second conservative president in a row to be ousted by impeachment. (The first was President Park Geun-hye in 2017.) It increased the chances of his progressive foes in the current opposition to regain power and reshape South Korea’s foreign policy.\n\nMr. Yoon pleased conservatives by adopting tough stances toward North Korea and China and expanding joint military drills with the United States. He also won plaudits from Washington when he improved ties with Japan to lay the ground for trilateral cooperation to deter China. His progressive rivals favor dialogue with North Korea and seek to be on good terms with both the United States, South Korea’s main military ally, and China, its biggest trade partner."

The president also said he was interested in looking into the Signal incident and tasked Waltz with the follow-up.\n\nAccording to NBC News citing one Department of Defense official and three additional anonymous sources, the reason for the dismissals is not immediately known.\n\nHaugh, an Air Force general, has led the NSA and Cyber Command since 2023, while Noble served as the senior civilian official at the agency, the Associated Press reports.\n\nNBC News notes that Haugh and Nobel are career officials with decades of experience in intelligence.\n\nThe Washington Post was the first to report on their dismissals.\n\nDemocratic Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut posted to X, formerly Twitter, reacting to the news: \"I am deeply disturbed by the decision to remove General Haugh as Director of the National Security Agency. I have known General Haugh to be an honest and forthright leader who followed the law and put national security first — I fear those are precisely the qualities that could lead to his firing in this Administration. The Intelligence Committee and the American people need an immediate explanation for this decision, which makes all of us less safe.\"\n\nDemocratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia also posted to X on Thursday night: \"General Haugh has served our country in uniform, with honor and distinction, for more than 30 years. At a time when the United States is facing unprecedented cyber threats, as the Salt Typhoon cyberattack from China has so clearly underscored, how does firing him make Americans any safer?\"\n\nIt was unknown to Newsweek at the time of publication who will be appointed interim leader of the NSA after the shake-up."

        "full_text": "Vice President J.D. Vance touted the implementation of tariffs despite Thursday's massive stock market sell-off, telling Newsmax the Trump administration is \"feeling good\" while also reassuring one midwestern GOP senator that American farmers are going to be among those who \"reap the rewards\" in the end.\n\nVance joined \"Rob Schmitt Tonight\" to react to the Dow Jones tumbling 1,679 points on Thursday in reaction to President Donald Trump's tariffs. Vance asserted that \"one bad day\" in the stock market is going to render a \"booming market for a long time.\"\n\n\"We're feeling good. Look, I frankly thought in some ways it could be worse in the markets because this is a big transition. You saw the president said earlier today; it's like a patient who was very sick. We did the operation, and now it's time to make the patient better. And that's exactly what we're doing,\" Vance said.\n\n\"Look, one bad day in the stock market compared to what President Trump said earlier today, and I think he's right about this, we're going to have a booming stock market for a long time because we're reinvesting in the United States of America,\" Vance told Schmitt. \"And more importantly than that, of course, the people in Wall Street have done well; we want them to do well. But we care the most about are American workers and about American small businesses. And they're the ones who are really going to benefit from these policies.\"\n\nVance reminded that tariffs were not a surprise; Trump said months ago what he planned to do.\n\n\"[Y]ou had economic policies that rewarded shipping our jobs to China instead of investing in American workers. And that's what President Trump — he ran on changing it; he promised he would change it; and now he has,\" Vance said.\n\n\"Frankly, we could have gone a lot higher,\" he added about the tariffs. \"But the president is trying to send a message that, you know, yeah, we're going to be a little kind. We're going to be a little discounted.\"\n\nThe vice president also addressed the concerns of Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who cosponsored a bipartisan bill Thursday that would bring the power over tariffs back to Congress.\n\n\"Now look, Chuck Grassley, I understand he's worried about farmers. But here's my message to Chuck Grassley: Do our farmers benefit when you have foreign competitors who send a lot of their farm products to the United States but refuse to let our great farmers send beef and send other exports to those countries? That's the whole problem here that we're trying to fix,\" Vance said.\n\n\"That unfairness is why the president implemented these reciprocal tariffs. And really, fairness is the name of the game,\" Vance added. \"Chuck Grassley's a good guy. I know he's worried about our farmers, but the way to fight for American farmers is to tell foreign countries you can't stop what American farmers produce from coming in.

        "full_text": "The Trump administration’s tariffs are, by every reasonable account, an economic catastrophe in the making. So why are they happening?\n\nOne explanation is that this is simply democracy at work. President Donald Trump campaigned on doing more or less exactly what he’s just done, and the voting public elected him. So here we are.\n\nThat’s at best a partial story. In fact, it’s probably more accurate to see Trump’s tariffs as a symptom of democratic decay — of America transitioning into a kind of strange hybrid system that combines both authoritarian and democratic features.\n\nWere America’s democracy functioning properly, Trump wouldn’t have the power to impose such broad tariffs unilaterally. Congress, not the presidency, has the constitutional authority to raise taxes — and tariffs are, of course, a tax on imports.\n\nYet the basic design of the American system has broken down, allowing the president to usurp far more authority than is healthy. In many policy areas, the presidency functions less like a democratic chief executive who operates under constraint and more like an elected dictatorship.\n\nAnd historically, dictatorships — elected or otherwise — suffer from a fatal flaw: they have no ability to stop the people at the top from acting on their policy whims and, in the process, producing national disasters. This tendency is why democracy tends to produce superior policy outcomes over the long run; why America, and not Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union, won the 20th century.\n\nThe tariffs, in short, show the true stakes of democratic decline. It’s not just a matter of abstract principle, but the difference between stability and disaster.\n\nAmerica’s democratic decline caused the tariffs\n\nWhen Donald Trump and Elon Musk began laying waste to the federal government in February, the political scientist Adam Przeworski declared himself “at a loss.” Though Przeworski is one of the world’s most eminent scholars of comparative democracy, author of many defining pieces in the field, he could not find the right vocabulary to describe what was happening in the United States.\n\nThough “Trump was elected in fair elections,” his subsequent policy agenda amounted to “revolutionary change of the relation between the state and society” — one that attempts to replace the rules and norms that define democratic politics with something very different.\n\nUnderstanding America in this more textured sense, as a country under a new and confusing regime that is both democratic and not, helps us make better sense out of the Trump tariff debacle.\n\nOn the one hand, an electorate that picked Trump is getting one of Trump’s signature policies. Sometimes, in democracies, demagogues win elections — a problem so old that you can find a discussion of it in Plato’s Republic.\n\nOn the other hand, democracies rely on legal rules constraining the executive to prevent any such demagogue from becoming a dictator. In the American system, that means a complex system of constitutional checks and balances — one of which is the Constitution granting taxation powers to Congress and Congress alone. Yet instead of asking for statutory authorization to raise tariffs, Trump is exploiting broadly worded emergency legislation to do an end-run around the legislative branch.\n\nThis is what a hybrid political system looks like in practice. The United States still has free and fair elections at all levels of government, and is in that sense democratic. But elections don’t matter in the way that they’re supposed to, because the people’s representatives in Congress are not playing their constitutionally assigned policymaking role. This is the autocratic component of the current American system, one that enables the president to sabotage the global economy if he so wishes.\n\nThe transformation of America, from democracy to Frankensteinian amalgam, has been in the works for decades.\n\nThe primary culprit is Congress, which has — due to a combination of partisanship and political cowardice — become both unable and unwilling to act as the supreme lawmaking body. Instead, it began delegating significant amounts of its own authority to the executive.\n\nSometimes, this was intentional — authorizing the president to make policy through executive agencies, creating the “administrative state” conservatives decry. Sometimes, it was unintentional: Congress giving the president vague emergency powers that were supposed to function in narrow circumstances, but in practice allowed the president to act unilaterally in all sorts of “normal” policy debates. And sometimes, Congress simply did nothing on crucial policy issues — forcing the president to try to address them with dubiously broad interpretations of their own powers.\n\nThe judicial branch deserves some blame too. While the Supreme Court has occasionally stepped in to address presidential overreach, it has done so in a haphazard and partisan way. Moreover, it has long deferred to the president on key issues like immigration, trade, and war.\n\nObservers on both the liberal left and the libertarian right warned for decades that growing executive power posed a problem for democracy and good policymaking. Obviously, they were right to do so in hindsight. Yet part of the reason that they were ignored is that there were other checks on the president that seemed to keep the executive in line.\n\nSome of these were internal executive branch checks. The White House relied on the Office of Legal Counsel — a group of senior executive branch attorneys — to provide independent opinions on the legality of various policy options. Internal policy shops like the Council of Economic Advisers provided informed expert opinions that would steer presidents toward more evidence-based policymaking. In dire cases, the Justice Department would probe potentially criminal activity by executive branch staff.\n\nOther checks were more informal. Fear of losing the war for public opinion might prevent a president from taking a particularly radical stance. The president’s own moral code, a sense that there are just certain things one shouldn’t do even if you can, also provided a kind of soft check on the abuse of power.\n\nBut what’s clear now is that all of these internal mechanisms were voluntary. Trump has neutered executive branch checks on his authority and (clearly!) does not possess the judgment we expect from people in the highest office.\n\nIt turns out that the rest of the political system — and especially Congress — had created the conditions for our descent into a hybrid political system. The only barriers remaining were norms about how the executive branch should work, ones that a determined president like Trump could smash through with ease.\n\nThe tariffs show why our hybrid system is so dangerous\n\nSometimes, the stakes in this kind of conversation can feel a little fuzzy. Why does it matter if we are living in a hybrid system rather than a full democracy? Sure, the president may be powerful, but if we’ve still got elections, then isn’t everything going to be fine in the end?\n\nThe tariffs provide one of the clearest examples of why this matters for everyone: without democracy, the quality of our policymaking gets dangerously worse.\n\nPolitical scientists have long found that, on average, democracies produce better outcomes for citizens than authoritarian states. They produce higher rates of economic growth, superior technological innovation, better public health services, and are even more likely to win wars.\n\nOne of the key reasons for democracy’s success has been its formalized policymaking process. Because laws are changed through legal and transparent processes, ones subject to public debate and legal oversight, they are more likely to both be well-informed by the best available evidence and corrected if something goes badly.\n\nAuthoritarian and hybrid regimes ditch these constraints, which allows them to make policy changes a lot faster. But it also enables one person, or a small group of people, to make radical decisions on a whim with disastrous consequences.\n\nThink about Mao’s Great Leap Forward in China, a direct product of the leader’s adherence to a Communist ideology that was out of touch with reality. While Trump’s tariffs are nowhere near as evil — the Great Leap Forward killed somewhere between 18 and 32 million people — the same formal problem contributed to both mistakes.\n\nFor a more recent example, look at Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The disaster began with Putin’s personal obsession with the idea that Ukrainian nationhood was fake and that the territory was rightfully Russian. This notion went from Putin’s personal obsession to actual war because no one could stop him.\n\nTrump’s tariffs will, if fully implemented, be remembered as their own cautionary tale. While he campaigned on them, he wouldn’t have been able to implement the entire tariff package had he gone through the normal constitutionally prescribed procedure for raising taxes. The fact that America isn’t functioning like a normal democracy, with public deliberation and multiple checks on executive authority, is what allowed Trump to act on his idiosyncratic ideas in the manner of a Mao or Putin.\n\nNow, it’s still possible that Trump steps back from the brink. But even if he does, and the worst outcome is avoided, the lesson should be clear: the long decay of America’s democratic system means that we are all living under an axe.\n\nAnd if this isn’t the moment it falls, there will surely be another."

        "full_text": "Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino.\n\nIn his Rose Garden announcement of sweeping new “reciprocal tariffs,” President Donald Trump held aloft a misleading chart that claimed to give a breakdown of the tariffs other countries charge the U.S. and the corresponding tariff that the U.S. will now impose against those countries.\n\n“Reciprocal. That means they do it to us and we do it to them,” Trump said in his April 2 speech. “Very simple. Can’t get any simpler than that.”\n\nTrump said the U.S. would begin charging a “minimum baseline tariff of 10%” on all imported goods. But he said the U.S. would also tariff countries at a rate equal to half of tariff rates that countries charged for U.S. goods “including currency manipulation and trade barriers.” That, according to Trump’s chart, would mean tariffs of 50% on imports from some countries.\n\nThe first column next to the list of countries purported to represent “Tariffs Charged to the U.S.A.” as a percentage. A cursory look revealed, however, that the percentages are far higher than the average tariff rates published by the World Trade Organization. Smaller print under the “Tariffs Charged” heading notes — as Trump did — that the figures include “Currency Manipulation and Trade Barriers.” Those last two factors are harder to quantify, but it turns out that’s not how the White House arrived at its figures anyway.\n\n“You see the numbers, the numbers are so disproportionate, they’re so unfair,” Trump said.\n\nAccording to a fact sheet provided by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the reciprocal tariffs were “calculated as the tariff rate necessary to balance bilateral trade deficits between the U.S. and each of our trading partners. This calculation assumes that persistent trade deficits are due to a combination of tariff and non-tariff factors that prevent trade from balancing. Tariffs work through direct reductions of imports.”\n\nUSTR said that while computing trade deficit effects for every country “is complex, if not impossible, their combined effects can be proxied by computing the tariff level consistent with driving bilateral trade deficits to zero.”\n\nTo approximate that, USTR said it divided the size of a country’s trade imbalance with the U.S. in goods by how much America imports in goods from that nation.\n\nTake the European Union, for example. The chart lists its tariffs charged for U.S. imports (again, including currency manipulation or trade barriers) as 39%. Trump said the U.S. would charge countries half of what they are charging the U.S., because charging the full reciprocal amount “would have been tough for a lot of countries.” So in the case of the EU, the “USA Discounted Reciprocal Tariffs” is 20%, the chart states.\n\nAccording to the World Trade Organization, the EU’s trade-weighted average tariff rate is 2.7%. Trump also noted that European countries charge a value-added tax of about 20% — it varies by country but that’s roughly accurate. But those taxes are levied on imports as well as domestic production, so the VAT does not provide any trade advantage. In any case, neither of those numbers factor into the White House’s math.\n\nHow does the White House arrive at 39%? In 2024, the U.S. goods trade deficit with the EU was $235.6 billion. That year, the U.S. imported $605.8 billion worth of goods from the EU. So, $235.6 divided by $605.8 is 38.9%, or, rounded up, 39%.\n\nEconomists told us that’s not a legitimate way to calculate reciprocal tariffs for countries.\n\n“Those listed numbers are simply not tariffs, but some other made-up measure based on a formulaic trade deficit calculation,” Kimberly Clausing, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told us via email. “In almost every instance, countries’ true trade barriers are far, far lower.”\n\n“This is not a legitimate way to calculate trade barriers, and the vast majority of subject matter experts (I would wager >99% of international economists) would reject this methodology as profoundly flawed,” Clausing said.\n\n“For example,” she said, “imagine you have completely free trade with an island that produces mangos but lacks sufficient income to buy US goods. The US buys $100 in mangos and sends only $20 in exports. This would imply a tariff rate of 40% by the Trump method, (80/100 divided by 2), but the imbalance of trade represents only the fact of distinct comparative advantage in trade, not any trade barriers.”\n\nOr, as the New York Times put it, “The difference between exports and imports doesn’t necessarily reflect trade barriers; Americans may simply want to buy more stuff from, say, Japan than the Japanese want to buy from the United States.”\n\n“The Trump administration’s calculations are a fundamentally nonsensical way to calculate ‘reciprocal’ tariffs,” Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, told us. “Absolutely none of the factors the White House purports to be looking at, like tariffs, non-tariff barriers, or other unfair practices, factor in to the tariff rate they calculate in any way. They are invented numbers that have zero relationship to real policies.”\n\nWilliam Reinsch, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former president of the National Foreign Trade Council, concurred.\n\n“We do not believe it is an appropriate or accurate measure of trade barriers,” Reinsch told us via email. “We believe their methodology basically has nothing to do with reciprocal tariffs as the administration had previously discussed. The most charitable interpretation of what they are saying is ‘this is the tariff rate that would be necessary to balance bilateral trade with each partner.'”\n\nCountries with which the U.S. has a trade surplus – such as the U.K. and Singapore – are still listed on the chart as charging 10% tariffs.\n\nAccording to York, if the aim is to balance trade with every country, these proposed tariffs won’t work.\n\n“Tariffs will not reduce the US trade deficit because tariffs, either through their effects on the US dollar or through retaliation, will also reduce US exports,” York said. “That’s a result borne out in economic literature, and in recent US experience with the 2018-2019 tariffs.”\n\nEconomists also noted that the White House equation focuses only on goods, and ignores trade in services, where the U.S. enjoys a trade surplus.\n\n“That skews the results. A lot,” Clausing, of the Peterson Institute, told us. “The US has a comparative advantage in services, and this ignores our substantial trade surpluses in that sector.”\n\n“Excluding services is simply wrong and doesn’t give the full picture,” Stuart Malawer, a professor emeritus of policy and government at George Mason University, told us via email.\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Fact Sheet\n\nThe USTR fact sheet on the reciprocal tariff calculations cited a handful of academic studies, but when we reached out to the authors of several of them, they balked at the Trump administration’s conclusions.\n\n“The tariffs charged to the USA column certainly does not represent legislated tariffs faced by the US,” Anson Soderbery, an economics professor at Purdue University and author of the research paper “Trade elasticities, heterogeneity, and optimal tariffs,” told us via email. “Those are much smaller than reported and take into account bilateral agreements (e.g., USMCA, WTO preferential duties, etc).\n\n“If they are using the USTR formula proposed this morning to adjust those numbers, I am even less sure how to go about evaluating what they mean,” Soderbery said. “That is, suggesting trade imbalances are only due to trade barriers is not founded in any economic theory or methodology. And, further suggesting the reductionist formula exports-imports/imports can be used to back out all trade barriers and equivalent tariff rates is misguided.”\n\nIna Simonovska of the University of California, Davis, and co-author of “The elasticity of trade: Estimates and evidence,” told us via email, “The formula that the administration uses is correct under the assumption that the objective is to arrive at a zero bilateral trade balance with a given trade partner, holding fixed any other effects.” But there will be other effects, she said, including “the changes in exports that would occur due to the domestic price increases caused by the tariff as well as changes in trade flows with other trade partners than the one that the tariff targets. … These effects are harmful so they would result in a lower optimal tariff compared to the reported one” in the White House chart.\n\nThe USTR fact sheet also cites as a reference for its estimates a paper published in American Economic Review, “The Long and Short (Run) of Trade Elasticities.” One of the authors of that paper, Andrei Levchenko, a professor of international economics at the University of Michigan, told us via email that the “elasticity estimate” in the paper and used by the USTR “should not be directly applied in this tariff calculation.”\n\n“The key reason is that the concept of the trade elasticity holds everything else constant,” he explained. “In practice, everything else will not be constant. In particular, US exports could change. That can come from a variety of channels, but one important one is tariff retaliation by trading partners. If a trading partner puts tariffs on US exports to it, they will fall, (at least partially) un-doing the impact of lower imports on the trade deficit.\n\n“Beyond this, there are many other ways in which the change in US imports and exports will differ from the formula that directly applies a partial equilibrium trade elasticity,” he said. “For example, trade elasticity estimates do not account for any impact of the change in tariffs on wages, prices, exchange rates, and the stock market. Those can go in different directions depending on the country, the product, the production technology used, etc. For small tariff changes on individual products from individual countries, these changes might be small and could reasonably be ignored. However, the change in imports and in the bilateral trade balance implied by the partial equilibrium trade elasticity is likely to be\n\nunreliable when the tariff change is large and comprehensive (covering all goods), as is the case today.”\n\nRepeated Claims\n\nTrump got other things wrong in his tariff announcement. He continued to wrongly frame his tariffs as a way to raise “trillions and trillions of dollars to reduce our taxes.” Tariffs are a tax. And because U.S. importers pay the tariffs, and often pass at least some of their increased costs onto consumers through higher prices, tariffs are considered to be regressive taxes, affecting lower-income households more than others as a percentage of income.\n\nA Tax Foundation analysis projected that the tariffs announced on April 2, combined with earlier tariffs announced by Trump, would raise nearly $3.2 trillion in revenue over 10 years. But the tariffs would also reduce Americans’ after-tax income, amounting to “an average tax increase of more than $2,100 per US household in 2025,” the Tax Foundation said.\n\nTrump also repeated false or misleading trade claims that we’ve already covered.\n\nHe said Canada “imposes a 250 to 300% tariff on many of our dairy products,” referring to rates that would only be charged if U.S. exports to Canada ever exceeded predetermined quotas. He said tariffs made the U.S. “proportionately the wealthiest it has ever been” between 1789 and 1913, even though real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product per capita is many times higher today than it was more than a century ago. And he claimed that during his first term he “took in hundreds of billions of dollars” from tariffs on China, which he said “never paid 10 cents to any other president.” But the U.S. has long collected billions from customs duties on Chinese imports — and the tariffs are paid by U.S. importers, not China."

        "full_text": "The Senate GOP budget plan designed to usher President Trump’s sweeping domestic priorities into law is getting an ice-cold reception from Republicans in the House, where conservatives are balking at the low levels of mandated spending cuts and the heightened deficits that could result.\n\nBut after Trump’s endorsement of the plan, House Republicans face enormous pressure to give the president a victory on his top campaign promises, including an extension of tax cuts, new limits on immigration and a boost in domestic energy production. That pressure will likely grow in the face of the fallout from Trump’s new tariffs, which sent markets plummeting Thursday and threatened a global recession.\n\nThe budget debate is just the latest challenge for Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and his leadership team, who are already struggling to resolve an internal battle over proxy voting for new parents — one that’s shut down floor activity indefinitely — and will soon confront the dilemma of how to approach the Senate budget blueprint in the face of the uproar within their House GOP conference.\n\nIf the early response is any indication, they have their work cut out.\n\n“THE SENATE VERSION IS DEAD ON ARRIVAL,” Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.), a member of the hard-line conservative House Freedom Caucus, wrote in a text message, “among many of our Freedom Caucus members as well as other conservatives who are concerned about the lack of cuts in the Senate bill.”\n\n“What they sent back was not a serious counter to our House version,” he added.\n\n“The Senate budget bill is really offensive; quite frankly, it’s a joke,” Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) said Thursday. “[T]his is offensive and so I’m a hard no on this junk.”\n\nConservatives like Ogles are up in arms specifically over the Senate’s proposal requiring upper-chamber committees to locate at least $4 billion in specific cuts to federal spending — a microscopic fraction of the $1.5 trillion minimum in cuts mandated under the budget blueprint adopted by the House in February.\n\n“Look, $1.5 trillion, that was a serious offer from the House of Representatives,” Ogles said. “A $3 to $4 billion cut is offensive to the American people, it’s a joke, it should not have been presented.”\n\nIn an effort to address those concerns, Senate Republicans included two tiers of instructions in their compromise plan, mandating at least $4 billion in cuts for Senate committees and a minimum of $1.5 trillion for those in the House. Senate Republicans also maintain that the $4 billion is just a starting point designed to grant committees maximum flexibility in locating cuts, and the number will rise dramatically in the weeks to come.\n\nHouse conservatives, however, don’t believe it. Earlier this week, amid reports of the compromise budget resolution including two different sets of instructions, Norman said he would not back a measure with those details.\n\n“It’s got to be the $2 trillion,” Norman said, referring to the target for spending cuts included in the House’s budget resolution. “We have to be in lockstep with that.”\n\nAnother hard-line conservative, who asked for anonymity to discuss a sensitive dispute, accused the Senate of trying to jam the House with a package that would do little to rein in deficit spending, expressing doubt that the lower chamber’s instructions would reign supreme.\n\n“Different instructions is code for: ‘We’re the Senate and our instructions will win out,’” the lawmaker said Thursday.\n\nEven House Budget Committee Chair Jodey Arrington (R-Texas) is backing up his hard-line conservative colleagues, airing concerns that those on the right-flank will not get on board with the blueprint.\n\n“I can’t imagine any world where deficit hawks in the House would ever walk away from the reconciliation process with the deficit going up at the rate it would with that framework,” Arrington said Wednesday, according to Politico. “I would have tremendous concern.”\n\nAnother gripe from the conservatives relates to the Senate’s plan to abandon normal budget rules and adopt an accounting gimmick that puts the cost of extending Trump’s 2017 tax cuts at $0 — a far cry from the roughly $4 trillion the Congressional Budget Office has estimated. That might help with the scoring, the critics say, but it will only exacerbate the nation’s $36 trillion debt.\n\n“Adopting a policy baseline does not change basic math,” Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) said Thursday. “And the Senate is not indicating it can do that math.”\n\nThe blowback highlights the difficulties facing GOP leaders in both chambers as they race to adopt Trump’s domestic agenda in the coming months. The Republicans are expected to move the legislation on an obscure procedural track, known as reconciliation, which prevents the minority Democrats from blocking the package with a filibuster in the upper chamber.\n\nBut uniting the various factions of the GOP conference poses unique difficulties — a challenge only exacerbated by the Republicans’ hairline majority in the House, where just a few defections would sink the whole project. With Democrats poised to oppose the measure unanimously, the Speaker can afford to lose only three of his members on the vote, assuming full attendance.\n\nIf the conservative demands for sharper cuts were the only factor, the fix might be easy. But more moderate Republicans — many of them facing tough reelections in battleground districts — have their own red lines. And a number of those lawmakers are wary that slashing trillions of dollars in spending would necessarily gut federal programs that benefit their constituents, including Medicaid, which is likely facing sharp cuts under the House budget plan.\n\nSome of those centrist are already advocating for the smaller cuts championed by the Senate.\n\n“The end bill will be more like the Senate’s numbers,” Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.), who represents a district former Vice President Kamala Harris won in 2024, told The Hill. “There’s about 20 of us who are public that we won’t support Medicaid cuts that hurt patients or hospitals.”\n\nRep. David Valadao (R-Calif.), another centrist Republican, sounded a similar note, pointing to the difficult dynamics leadership is facing as they try to appease both ends of the ideologically diverse GOP conference.\n\n“I think ultimately the Senate’s gonna win out,” he told The Hill. “The numbers are probably more aligned with where most members are. But it is going to be a complicated flight.”\n\n“On the far-right, they’re not gonna be happy, and on the moderate side, they’re not gonna be happy,” he added. “So it’s gonna be painful for everyone.”\n\nThe sensitive balancing act is set to come to a head next week, when Johnson plans to bring the budget resolution to the floor — as long as the Senate can advance it this weekend.\n\n“The Senate moves on the resolution today, and we’ll be moving it through the House next week and that is, you know, the starting gun for the big game,” Johnson said Wednesday. “It’s the kickoff of the game to get the budget reconciliation bill done.”\n\nTrump is likely to be a wild card in the debate — one that GOP leaders are hoping can unite the fractious conference. In February, the president did just that when House Republicans passed their budget resolution even after some lawmakers expressed concerns. And Trump did it again last month when he rallied House Republicans behind a government spending bill — a topic that has historically split the conference.\n\nHe quickly jumped into the budget debate this week, endorsing the Senate legislation shortly after it was unveiled.\n\n“The Senate Budget plan gives us the tools that we need to get our shared priorities done, including certain PERMANENT Tax Cuts, Spending Cuts, Energy, Historic Investments in Defense, Border, and much more,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, the media platform he owns.\n\n“Every Republican, House and Senate, must UNIFY. We need to pass it IMMEDIATELY!”\n\nLending Johnson a boost, Florida voters on Tuesday sent two Republicans to the House, filling empty seats vacated by GOP lawmakers following November’s elections. The development gives GOP leaders a slightly larger cushion, and the Speaker said he was “elated” after swearing in the new pair on Wednesday.\n\n“The margin is a little more comfortable,” he added. “It’s an embarrassment of riches now. We can move, what, three votes now, or something. We’re gonna build consensus around this, we’re excited.”"

        "full_text": "On April 2nd, President Donald J. Trump did something no other modern president has had the spine to do. He declared “Liberation Day” and slapped sweeping tariffs on the very nations that have been gutting the American economy for decades. A 10 percent universal tariff across all imports. Targeted, punitive tariffs up to 34 percent on bad actors like China. And guess what? We should be furious—not at Trump—but at the spineless presidents before him who let things get this bad in the first place.\n\nLet’s be clear: these tariffs didn’t start a trade war. They responded to one.\n\nFor decades, our so-called allies and trading partners have been gleefully waging economic warfare on the United States, with the full permission — no, the encouragement — of prior administrations. China flooded our markets with cheap steel, violating trade norms and collapsing American mills. The European Union protected its own industries while slapping barriers on ours. Japan, Taiwan, and others enjoyed one-sided access to our consumers while shielding their own markets with layers of red tape and tariffs.\n\nAnd what did our leaders do in response? They looked the other way. Smiled. Shook hands. Signed one-sided trade deals. Sold us out. They told us it was for the “global good,” for “peace,” for “prosperity.” But the only people prospering were in Beijing, Brussels, and Tokyo. In small-town Ohio, Detroit, and western Pennsylvania, all we got were pink slips and boarded-up factories.\n\nTrump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs are long overdue justice. They’re a correction to a rigged game that’s been hurting American businesses, workers, and families for far too long.\n\nLet’s talk steel and aluminum. In 2018, President Trump placed a 25 percent tariff on foreign steel and 10 percent on aluminum to push back against dumping and reclaim our national security edge. That wasn’t a rash decision — it was backed by years of data showing our dependence on foreign metals made us vulnerable. Yet in that time, D.C. elites told us to let it happen. That “free trade” meant letting foreign nations cheat while we played by the rules.\n\nEven our farmers haven’t been spared. Take California’s almond growers — part of a $23.6 billion ag export economy. Under previous administrations, they were hung out to dry as countries like China and India retaliated against our lack of backbone by imposing their own crushing tariffs. Instead of defending our farmers, those in power shrugged and said it was the cost of doing business in a “global economy.”\n\nIt’s nonsense. And it’s unforgivable.\n\nNow, the hand-wringers in the media — and predictably, the Biden administration holdovers — are moaning that these tariffs could raise consumer prices. That they could cause friction. That they might prompt retaliation.\n\nGood.\n\nLet them squirm.\n\nBecause the goal here isn’t to make life easy for globalist bureaucrats. It’s to bring fairness back to American trade. To restore dignity to American work. And to put America first — unapologetically.\n\nTreasury Secretary Bessent was right to warn other nations not to retaliate. The message is simple: this isn’t about starting fights, it’s about ending decades of economic surrender. For too long, the U.S. has subsidized the success of other nations while they’ve exploited our openness. That ends now.\n\nAnd let’s talk about the bigger picture. These tariffs aren’t just about economics — they’re about sovereignty and national security. COVID-19 exposed what happens when America offshores everything from microchips to medicine. We were left scrambling. Now, with these tariffs, we have a shot at rebuilding critical industries here at home.\n\nWe’ve heard for years that American manufacturing is a relic of the past. That we should get used to “service sector” jobs. That we can just code apps and order stuff from China. But what happens when China turns off the tap? What happens when global supply chains buckle?\n\nWe need American factories. We need American steel. We need Americans building things again.\n\nTariffs may cause short-term adjustments, but they pave the way for long-term independence. And that’s worth every penny.\n\nThe truth is, these tariffs are a moral issue. When we allow foreign governments to manipulate currency, exploit labor, and dump products in our markets, we’re enabling injustice. And when our own leaders look the other way, they’re complicit.\n\nPresident Trump isn’t just fixing trade — he’s exposing the rot. He’s showing us how many American politicians were more loyal to global think tanks than to the people who elected them.\n\nAnd that’s what really stings the establishment.\n\nBecause Trump — like Reagan before him — puts the American people first. Not in rhetoric. Not in focus-grouped slogans. But in action. Bold, unapologetic, unmistakable action.\n\nWhere Reagan challenged the Soviets, Trump is challenging a corrupt globalist system. And just like Reagan was right then, Trump is right now.\n\nIf you’re not angry about these tariffs, you’re not paying attention. We should be furious — that it took this long to get here. Furious at presidents who smiled while our industries died. Furious at politicians who used middle America as a bargaining chip for Davos clout.\n\nBut thanks to Trump, the tide is turning.\n\nHe may be the only president since Reagan who’s had the courage to stare down the world and say, “You will not take advantage of America anymore.”\n\nAnd for that, every American — every farmer, every factory worker, every small business owner — should be standing and cheering.\n\nBecause it’s about time someone stood up for us. Shame on the ones who didn’t. And thank God for the one who finally did."

        "full_text": "President Trump’s approval rating slipped to its lowest point during his second White House term amid his handling of the economy and the recent Houthi Signal chat leak, according to a survey published Wednesday.\n\nThe new Reuters/Ipsos poll found that the president’s approval rating was 43 percent, representing a 2-point drop since the late March iteration of the survey. After Trump took office on Jan. 20, his approval rating stood at 47 percent.\n\nIn the latest poll, 37 percent of respondents approved of Trump’s handling of the economy and 30 percent approved of his approach to addressing the high cost of living in the country.\n\nA majority of Americans, 52 percent, said that hiking tariffs on cars and auto parts will be detrimental to the people they are close with. A similar share of respondents said increasing tariffs across the board, as Trump announced he was doing on Wednesday, would make things worse, not better. Approximately a third of Republican and Republican-leaning voters said that tariffs would harm the economy, according to the poll.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump outlined the U.S.’s new tariff plan, slapping a minimum 10 percent import tax on goods coming into the nation. Many countries face higher rates, led by the 54 percent tariff levied on China.\n\nThe U.S.’s main trading partners — Mexico and Canada — were exempted from the fresh tariff package. Both countries are still subject to a 25 percent duty, although items covered under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement have been left unscathed.\n\nThe survey respondents also dinged Trump over the leaked Signal chat involving multiple members of his administration. The Atlantic’s top editor revealed in an article last week that he was inadvertently added to the Signal thread featuring top national security officials. Messages published by The Atlantic show the officials discussing military strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen, an attack that took place in mid-March.\n\nA large majority of respondents, 74 percent, including 91 percent of Democrats and 55 percent of GOP voters, stated that the officials were “reckless” for discussing the war plans in this manner. Twenty-two percent said it was harmless.\n\nJust more than a third of poll respondents, 34 percent, approved of Trump’s foreign policy, a 3-point drop from the late-March version of the survey. Nearly half, 48 percent, were satisfied with the president’s oversight of immigration.\n\nTrump’s approval rating dipped 3 points, dropping from 52 to 49 percent, in a recent Harvard CAPS/Harris poll. Forty-six percent disapproved of the commander in chief.\n\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted from March 31 to April 2 among 1,486 U.S. adults. The margin of error was about 3 percentage points."

        "full_text": "Oklahoma Superintendent Ryan Walters and the state's Department of Education have sued the Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF), claiming that the organization is conducting a \"blatant attack on the religious freedoms and Christians of Oklahoma students.\"\n\n\"We won't stand idly by while atheists try to erase faith,\" Walters said in a statement.\n\nWhen reached for comment, a spokesperson for Walters referred Newsweek to comments he made earlier this week in a press release and social media posts.\n\nWalters has drawn national attention and some scrutiny for his open endorsements of pro-religious policies across Oklahoma's public schools, in addition to bringing his support for President Donald Trump into statewide classrooms.\n\nIn November, less than two weeks after Trump's election victory, Walters announced that Oklahoma would be the first state in the nation to purchase more than 500 Bibles to be put into classrooms. Those Bibles mimicked the \"God Bless the USA Bibles,\" endorsed by Trump earlier in 2024, which include the U.S. Constitution, Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence and Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nAround the same time period, Walters touted the formation of Oklahoma's new Department of Religious Freedom and Patriotism within the state Department of Education (OSDE). Not only were public school superintendents sent videos requiring them to show students his video announcement—which included Walters praying for Trump—but also told school districts to also send the video to students' parents.\n\nOklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond later said that Walters couldn't force schools to show the video to students.\n\nThe lawsuit filed by Walters and OSED against FFRF on March 31 is described by officials as a legal response to FFRF's issuance of a cease-and-desist letter to an Oklahoma school district (Achilles Public Schools, or APS) for allowing a student to pray over the intercom.\n\n\"Oklahoma will never be bullied by radical, out-of-state atheists who use intimidation and harassment against kids,\" Walters said in a statement. \"The Freedom From Religion Foundation has no stake in our schools, no authority over our communities, and absolutely no right to trample on the First Amendment.\n\n\"Their threats are nothing more than a desperate attempt to erase faith from public life, and we will fight them at every turn.\"\n\nThe 24-page lawsuit, shared with Newsweek, states that Oklahoma statute clearly and unambiguously states that prayer is for any students \"who wish to do so\" and are not forced upon students—adding that under the state's \"Parents' Bill of Rights,\" multiple \"opt-out\" provisions are contained within regarding curriculum, instruction and participation.\n\nOn or about December 17, 2024, APS Superintendent Rick Beene reportedly received a letter from FFRF regarding \"unconstitutional school-sponsored prayer and bible readings.\"\n\nFFRF allegedly claimed that \"a concerned parent report[ed] that the district implemented a policy allowing teachers to read Bible verses at the beginning of their classes\" and that \"the district has a custom and practice of beginning each school day with a 'mandatory student-led prayer' over the schools' intercom systems.\"\n\nOklahoma is fighting back. Our kids, our parents, and our teachers will not be harassed for expressing their belief in God. We'll see you in court @FFRF. pic.twitter.com/t3g7pc7Z82\n\n\"The district must cease permitting instructors to teach students Bible verses, and it must end its schools' practice of beginning each day with school-sponsored student-led prayers,\" the FFRF also purportedly wrote.\n\n\"Despite having no standing whatsoever to do so, FFRF continuously threatens Oklahoma Public Schools with demand letters under the guise speaking on behalf of anonymous 'concerned parents' who have contacted them,\" the lawsuit reads.\n\nFFRF Legal Director Patrick Elliott told Newsweek the lawsuit is \"frivolous.\"\n\n\"It's not an attempt to improve education in Oklahoma,\" Elliott said. \"It seems to be political and to try to stifle the speech of the foundation in terms of our prior letters to school districts. We stand behind those. I think those raise serious constitutional problems with how some schools were operating.\"\n\nFFRF stands behind the idea that public schools cannot broadcast prayer at the start of a school day, he added, and they can't have teachers or students reading mandatory Bible readings every day.\n\nElliott described them as \"violations of the First Amendment.\"\n\nAsked about Walters' past comments and actions regarding religion in schools, such as placing Bibles inside classrooms, Elliott said the actions are all related.\n\n\"It's related in the sense that he wants to take over local control of schools, which are governed by local school boards,\" he said. \"He doesn't have authority to tell them what to do in terms of their particular curricular materials or whether or not they engage in prayer or Bible readings.\n\n\"He's really just trying to overreach and tells local schools what to do. So in terms of the state law and regulations, we just don't think he has any role like this at all to tell schools what to do on this.\"\n\nAbout 698,923 students were enrolled in an Oklahoma school as of October of the 2023-2024 school year, according to the Oklahoma State Report Card.\n\nThe Pew Research Center said that Oklahoma is \"tied for the 8th most religious state overall\" with \"66% of adults\" identifying as \"highly religious\" and \"71% say[ing] they believe in God with absolute certainty.\"\n\nFFRF Co-President Annie Laurie Gaylor: \"Ryan Walters is a loose cannon bent on destroying secular public education in Oklahoma. We are proud of FFRF's record of support for true religious freedom and the rights of conscience of a captive audience of schoolchildren to be free from government-sponsored indoctrination in our public schools.\"\n\nElliott said that FFRF's next move will be to dismiss the lawsuit.\n\nWalters and OSED said that \"the state remains resolute in its position and will vigorously oppose any efforts to undermine religious expression in its schools.\""

        "full_text": "The nation’s LGBTQ research field is collapsing.\n\nIn recent weeks, academics who focus on improving the health of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer Americans have been subjected to waves of grant cancellations from the National Institutes of Health. More than 270 grants totaling at least $125 million of unspent funds have been eliminated, though the true sum is likely much greater, researchers told NBC News.\n\nCancellation letters obtained by NBC News often vaguely state that the research in question no longer suits NIH priorities. Some allude to executive orders issued by President Donald Trump, including one that effectively bars recognition of transgender identities and another forbidding diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, initiatives. Other LGBTQ-focused grants have been swept up in the Trump administration’s broadsides against Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania. Academics fear more cancellations as the administration targets Harvard University.\n\nHundreds of researchers, many of them panicked, have watched as the system that supports their life’s work — to address the myriad health disparities faced by sexual and gender minorities — has been upended. Many of them suddenly face potential unemployment and a job market rendered bleak by the Trump administration’s efforts to downsize funding for academic research.\n\nOn Tuesday, mass layoffs across the Department of Health and Human Services included the gutting of programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that surveil the HIV epidemic among gay men in particular, according to a CDC official who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals. The Trump administration also eliminated a lab that conducts specialized testing of and assessment for drug resistance among bacterial sexually transmitted infections, including syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia, which are especially prevalent in gay men, according to another CDC official who similarly asked to remain anonymous.\n\n“This has been a devastating experience,” said Brian Mustanski, a psychologist and director of the Institute for Sexual and Gender Minority Health and Wellbeing at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago.\n\nMustanski, a pioneer in LGBTQ health research, built his program into a powerhouse, with his team cultivating some of the most robust data on gay and trans Americans in history. Now, he’s seen much of the institute topple in weeks and has been desperately seeking other positions for many of the half of his 120-person team who were supported by the grants.\n\nThe NIH’s new director, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, said in an emailed statement Wednesday that the agency remains “committed to supporting research aimed at improving the health and well-being of every American” but noted that it would be shifting its priorities “away from politicized DEI and gender ideology studies” in accordance with the president’s executive orders.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment. The CDC had no comment.\n\n‘An incredible lack of transparency’\n\nTransgender people face clear erasure from the national research agenda. As for gay people, the White House’s initial, narrow attention on trans populations in its executive orders suggested it might leave gays untouched. But the Trump administration’s justification of NIH grant rejections based on what it perceives as the employment of DEI principles in academia has ensnared many research grants focused on gay populations as well.\n\nThis includes research into reducing rates of HIV and other STIs. Such studies have also been canceled if they include trans people as an additional risk group.\n\nLast month, Mustanski said, the NIH canceled two major grants for his team. One supported its long-running study of the drivers of HIV acquisition, substance use and other negative health outcomes in young gay men. Last year, the study, which accrued almost 20 years of data from some participants, received a glowing assessment from the NIH.\n\nThe grant was canceled for ostensibly engaging in DEI, according to the termination letter, which Mustanski shared with NBC News.\n\n“It’s unclear how DEI is even defined,” he said. “That’s a big problem for scientists, because science is all about precision.”\n\nMustanski said his second grant supported implementing effective means of preventing and treating HIV as part of the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative that the first Trump administration launched.\n\n“There’s an incredible lack of transparency behind this process and who’s behind it,” Musanski said of the grant rejections. “That is not the condition that’s going to produce the best science.”\n\nAmid the prospect of both gay and trans people’s erasure from the nation’s research priorities, 30 editors of leading journals that focus on sex and gender research published an editorial last month in The Journal of Sex Research on this work’s importance.\n\n“Research into sexuality and gender is vital for identifying social, cultural, and medical needs of populations, and addressing inequalities across populations,” they stated. “Any limiting of research and forcing specific research agendas is an infringement on academic freedom and integrity.”\n\nIndeed, a clear chill has descended over many of the LGBTQ-focused researchers subjected to — or fearing — grant cancellations. NBC News reached out to more than 80 of them, but few responded and just seven were willing to speak on the record; the others said they were too scared of reprisals from the Trump administration.\n\n“Most of my colleagues are afraid to speak out, or they’re being muzzled by their institutions,” said Julia Marcus, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School.\n\n“This is what authoritarianism looks like. Fear keeps people silent,” said Marcus, who lost all her NIH grant funding for a trio of HIV and STI prevention studies, and shared the rejection letters with NBC News. With the hope for future grant opportunities appearing grim, she said, she faces the end of a 20-year career spent fighting HIV and promoting LGBTQ health.\n\nAny available private funding, from pharmaceutical companies, nonprofits and foundations, could not possibly rescue this overall field, she said.\n\nA quarter-century effort\n\nVirtually all of the nation’s LGBTQ-focused research apparatus has been built over the past quarter century. A notable catalyst was a 2011 Institute of Medicine report that called for greater research into documenting and addressing health disparities among LGBTQ people. The report cited their poorer mental health and higher rates of smoking, substance use disorders, STIs, certain cancers and suicidality.\n\n“Decades of evidence-based LGBTQ+ research has demonstrated the need for specific approaches to improve health outcomes in this community,” said Dr. Philip Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Brown University, who noted he was not speaking on behalf of his employer.\n\nThe Biden administration placed particular emphasis on addressing the needs of sexual and gender minorities, and NIH research funds flourished accordingly. Such prioritization, researchers told NBC News, opened increasing avenues for what is known as precision public health or precision medicine, in which research identifies the specific needs of subpopulations and develops evidence-based, targeted interventions accordingly. This, researchers such as Marcus asserted, is the efficient use of public resources at its finest.\n\nNIH-funded research recently scored a landmark win by proving that taking the antibiotic doxycycline following sex slashed STI rates among gay men and trans women — an intervention believed to have driven a remarkable recent turnaround in such cases. But now $7.4 million in NIH support for two follow-up studies, including one on safety monitoring for drug-resistant pathogens, has been eliminated, according to the studies’ lead investigators.\n\nThe Adolescent Medicine Trials Network, terminated last month, was in the third year of a seven-year pair of grants — totaling more than $70 million in lost funds — to improve prevention, diagnosis and treatment of HIV among adolescents and young adults, most centrally young gay men.\n\n“As we talk about government waste and being more efficient, one thing that just really doesn’t make sense is to cut studies that have already invested millions and millions of dollars in their final years,” Chan said.\n\nChan said he lost two NIH grants last month, totaling about $3 million in unspent funds, and he shared those termination letters with NBC News. One focused on improving the mental health of LGBTQ people negatively affected by the Covid pandemic. The second concerned a program to boost adherence to the HIV-prevention pill, called PrEP, among Black gay and bisexual men.\n\n“Given the overall goal of LGBTQ+ research of not just improving, but extending the lives of LGBTQ+ Americans, the effective dissolution of this research threatens to widen health disparities related to HIV, mental health, substance use, and chronic disease, which will eventually affect everyone in our society,” he said.\n\nPotential elimination from vital government surveys\n\nIlan Meyer, a professor at the Williams Institute at UCLA’s School of Law, has sounded the alarm that LGBTQ people also face potential elimination from major, ongoing federal surveys regarding health and crime victimization, as well as the census.\n\n“We are about to lose knowledge about the LGBT population that has been essential for understanding policy, for providing advice to litigation, for providing evidence for courts. And to inform the public,” he said.\n\nThe inclusion of questions regarding sexuality and gender identity on these surveys has been a hard-fought win for LGBTQ advocates. The resulting data has been the basis of hundreds of academic papers — including some, Meyer noted, that helped persuade a judge to overturn California’s ban on same-sex marriage in 2010.\n\nA new Williams Institute report Meyer co-authored asserted that it “seems likely,” to appease the Trump administration, that future cycles of federal health surveys would eliminate questions on gender identity, and possibly sexual orientation as well. The CDC, for one, announced in February that it would cease collecting data on gender identity in its surveys.\n\n“The removal of such data from the public record and the loss of future data would set the United States decades backward to a time when little was known about the current demography, health, and well-being of the 14 million LGBT people in the United States,” the report warns.\n\nInside NIH: A department in turmoil\n\nSources inside the NIH, who requested anonymity because they said they are forbidden to speak to the press and fear reprisals, described an agency thrown into turmoil.\n\nIn 2015, the NIH formed the Sexual and Gender Minority Research Office to coordinate LGBTQ research across the agency and, for example, to establish uniform language about sex, gender and sexual orientation across research projects.\n\nThe office has been a particular target of conservatives, who allege that it infuses ideological, unscientific perspectives into research. Consequently, Trump’s election in November ignited fears within the NIH that the new administration would gut the office. So in December, the office was effectively dissolved, and its seven staffers were dispersed into open positions where they hoped to continue working quietly in the background, according to two NIH employees familiar with the matter.\n\nOn March 4, all seven employees were placed on administrative leave. By that time, the Trump administration had already instituted sweeping layoffs of federal employees who were focused on what it characterized as DEI initiatives.\n\nNIH grantees, meanwhile, told NBC News that their designated agency program officers had been cut out of the loop from their grant cancellations.\n\n“It’s a bloodbath,” one NIH source said of the cancellations.\n\nOn Wednesday, the American Public Health Association and others sued the NIH in federal court over canceled grants, including those backing HIV-prevention research. Evidence suggests, the suit asserts, that the cancellation letters were originally developed by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, and not within the HHS or the NIH. The suit states: “For example, metadata associated with at least one such notice shows it was authored by ‘JoshuaAHanley.’ An attorney named Joshua A. Hanley, a 2021 law school graduate, works at DOGE.”\n\nHanley did not immediately respond to an email from NBC News seeking comment.\n\nInternal guidance issued to NIH grant management staff last week was cited by the lawsuit as evidence of the agency using “boilerplate notices to terminate hundreds of grants.” The document provided language for communicating with grantees, including: “It is the policy of the NIH not to prioritize [select one of the following: diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) research programs, gender identity, vaccine hesitancy, climate change or countries of concern, e.g., China or South Africa.]”\n\nMultiple cancellation letters reviewed by NBC News have stated: “Research programs based on gender identity are often unscientific, have little identifiable return on investment, and do nothing to enhance the health of many Americans. Many such studies ignore, rather than seriously examine, biological realities. It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize these research programs.”\n\nResearchers noted to NBC News that only a few of the canceled grants pertain to gender transition treatments for minors, which has become a political flashpoint.\n\nEven prominent right-wing critics of the agency’s approach to research related to gender identity have taken issue with the Trump administration’s tack of canceling grants.\n\nLeor Sapir, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, has advocated for NIH reforms that align with Trump’s orders on DEI and trans issues. However, he criticized the administration for its overly broad “search-term-based cancellation” of NIH grants.\n\n“It’s quintessential bull in a china shop — Trumpesque,” he said in an interview. “A much more fine-tuned approach needs to happen.”\n\nThe prevailing question facing NIH-funded researchers is whether such a recalibration will occur now that Bhattacharya was sworn in as director Tuesday. During his confirmation hearing early last month, Bhattacharya, a health economist formerly of Stanford, was asked repeatedly whether he would return the NIH to something resembling normal functioning.\n\n“I will follow the laws,” he said — a refrain he relied on for such questions. He added that he would “make sure” that researchers within and funded by the NIH, “have the resources they need to make sure that they do their research.”\n\nIn response to questions about the grant cancellations — including one about the Trump administration’s intentions regarding research specific to transgender people — Bhattacharya’s statement Wednesday said the agency would be committed to research that improves the health of all Americans, “regardless of their sexual identity,” though it notably did not mention gender identity.\n\nIt then noted that the agency would shift its priorities toward “research aimed at preventing, treating, and curing chronic conditions like cancer, diabetes, heart disease, obesity and many others that cause so much suffering and deaths among all Americans, LGBTQ individuals included.”\n\nThe statement made no specific mention of HIV, a chronic health condition that disproportionately affects gay men and trans women. Also not mentioned was that at least 16 of the LGBTQ-focused grants that were terminated concerned cancer, diabetes or heart disease.\n\nThe hard work begins\n\nLooking toward an uncertain future, Northwestern’s Mustanski, for one, said he hopes for success in appealing his grant rejections.\n\nDr. Kenneth Mayer, medical director of Fenway Health, a leading LGBTQ-focused health center in Boston, expressed hope for “some victories in the courts” over the grant cancellations. Noting he was not speaking on behalf of his employer, he added: “But I am not in denial, so the field could collapse.”\n\nMayer and other LGBTQ-health researchers expressed concern that their field would lose a generation of academics focused on these populations — through layoffs, hiring freezes and the likelihood that bright young people would eschew a newly uncertain career in academia and public health.\n\nMany veterans of this field reported suffering from what they characterize as foreboding déjà vu under the Trump regime.\n\nDr. Chris Beyrer, director of the Duke Global Health Institute, said the past few weeks have reminded him of the horrors he witnessed in the 1980s.\n\n“When I started my career in HIV research, there were really no dedicated funds” for LGBTQ-specific research, he said. Recently, he added, he’s been haunted by that period in his career, four decades ago, when he cared for babies dying of AIDS. This was a time when gay men perished of the disease by the tens of thousands while then-President Ronald Reagan remained largely, and notoriously, impassive.\n\nUCLA’s Meyer, however, struck an optimistic tone when he said that lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans Americans are nothing if not tenacious in the face of political adversity.\n\n“One thing that I tell students is LGBT people have been fighting for more than 100 years for our rights,” he said. “So, I think this just reminds us that we need to continue doing that.”"

The report analyzed the first Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) update since President Donald Trump returned to office.\n\n\"Forever chemicals,\" or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), are chemicals that do not break down easily and are linked to cancer and other health risks. These substances are found in everyday items such as non-stick cookware, food packaging, firefighting foams, and water-resistant clothing. As these products degrade, the chemicals leach into the soil and water, eventually entering the human bloodstream.\n\nUSA Today uncovered that 667 water systems have already surpassed the PFAS limits proposed by the EPA just a year ago. Under current regulations, utilities must address these violations by 2029. The EPA estimated last year that the PFAS limits could affect up to 6,000 water systems and protect about 100 million Americans who rely on those utilities for drinking water. However, advocates are concerned that these rules could be weakened, overturned, or face legal challenges.\n\nResearch from the found a strong link between PFAS and kidney and testicular cancer. There is also growing evidence suggesting connections to prostate, thyroid, breast, ovarian, and uterine cancers. The level of risk can depend on the type of PFAS and the extent of exposure.\n\nResearch published in the estimated that PFAS contamination in drinking water could cause around 4,600 to 6,800 cancer cases every year in the U.S.\n\nTo avoid exposure to these chemicals, the recommends using water filters certified to reduce PFAS levels, avoiding nonstick cookware that contains PFAS, limiting exposure to fast food packaging, and checking labels on personal care products to avoid those with ingredients linked to these chemicals."

        "full_text": "Christine Grady, a top bioethicist at the National Institutes of Health and the wife of former top NIH official Anthony Fauci, was among the health bureaucrats who received a layoff notice on Tuesday, according to news reports.\n\nGrady was given the boot as part of the post-pandemic restructuring of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), according to the New York Times and STAT News. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his top aides have said the layoffs are aimed at consolidating administrative functions and overhauling a failed status quo in Americans’ health.\n\nSome NIH leaders were given the option of transferring to one of the field offices of the Indian Health Service in Alaska, Montana, Minnesota, and other locations far removed from Washington, DC. But it’s not clear whether Grady was among the officials given the option of taking up a remote post hundreds of miles from the couple’s tony Beltway neighborhood. The couple had a net worth of $11.5 million by the time of Fauci’s 2022 retirement, according to federal disclosures, a jump from $7.6 million before the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Open The Books.\n\nEven an NIH official who described Grady as well respected acknowledged that her marriage to Fauci impacted the ability of the institutes to tackle ethical questions that risked reflecting poorly on the former White House medical advisor.\n\nAn NIH official speaking on the condition of anonymity told the Daily Caller News Foundation that Grady was “a good person with a major conflict of interest.”\n\n“One of the problems when the coverup was going on of the Wuhan lab leak, that whole fiasco, was that they were not listening to anyone giving ethics advice,” the official said. “If they had had someone at the table with knowledge of this, they would have said: ‘Hey do you want to play it this way, or be more transparent?’ Someone could have raised the question.” (RELATED: ‘Pandemic Is Over’: All NIH COVID Grants Eliminated Under New Directive)\n\n“That’s something Christine Grady could have, or should have, done,” the official continued. “She wasn’t able to do it because she was Fauci’s wife.”\n\n“Maybe they had discussions in private about what was going on,” the official said. “She was placed in a conflicted role because of that.”\n\nOther NIH officials in Fauci’s inner circle were also let go.\n\nClifford Lane, who had worked at Fauci’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) since 1991 — most recently as deputy director of clinical research and special projects — was also let go, according to the New York Times.\n\nNIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Director Emily Erbelding has also been let go, according to Government Executive. Erbelding was involved in communications with Fauci and with EcoHealth Alliance President Peter Daszak about the connection between the NIAID and high-risk virology in Wuhan, China, in 2020 according to emails obtained by U.S. Right to Know through the Freedom of Information Act and a congressional investigation.\n\nEmailed requests for comment to Grady, Lane and Erbelding received no immediate response.

We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.\n\nNow that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate media and joining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes to marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; senators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want to limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our independence.\n\nWe don't complain -- we can't stand complainers -- but we do call it how we see it.

We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.\n\nWe're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates them -- because we won’t bend the knee to political correctness.\n\nOne reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of our being, and we think she's worth saving from today’s craziness.\n\nHelp us save her.\n\nA second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train. We have trained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political spectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There’s a good chance they were trained at Daily Caller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, Newsmax, Daily Wire and many others.\n\nSimply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a fair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.\n\nSince 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. And we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible to ignore.\n\nWe can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can’t do it unless you — the everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment — have our back.\n\nPlease consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, corporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new generation of news reporters who will actually tell the truth. And help us remind Americans everywhere that there are millions of us who remain clear-eyed about our country's greatness.\n\nIn return for membership, Daily Caller Patriots will be able to read The Daily Caller without any of the ads that we have long used to support our mission.

        "full_text": "As it began fighting for its life in federal court last week, the law firm WilmerHale turned to the story that most budding lawyers hear before anything else.\n\nIt’s 1770, and a group of British soldiers is on trial after killing five colonists in the Boston Massacre. John Adams, a prominent voice for independence, has chosen to defend them. Despite widespread criticism at the time, America’s second president later described it as “one of the best pieces of service I ever rendered my country.”\n\nThe British crown had a penchant for punishing lawyers who argued for causes it didn’t like. While it took place before the Revolutionary War, the Boston Massacre trial helped establish the bedrock principle that the U.S. government would have no such power. Every defendant has the right to a lawyer, and every lawyer has the freedom to represent whom they choose.\n\nWhy We Wrote This\n\nAmerican law has long rested on the foundational principle that everyone has the right to a lawyer and that lawyers are free to choose whom they represent. Are the Trump executive orders endangering this principle?\n\nThe Trump administration is now – according to the WilmerHale lawsuit and numerous legal observers – endangering that principle. In a series of executive orders and memos issued over the past month, President Donald Trump has ordered sanctions on major law firms. The firms, he says, have supported his legal and political enemies and, more broadly, undermined U.S. policy and security interests. The orders inflict penalties that could financially and reputationally hamper the firms. More orders could come, the White House has suggested.\n\nSome firms are fighting back in court, while others have struck deals to avoid possible ruin. Overall, a climate of fear and confusion has settled over the cadre of elite law firms known familiarly as Big Law. Many lawyers interviewed would only speak to the Monitor anonymously out of concern they could attract unwanted attention to their firm.\n\nThese actions may be unprecedented in American history, but they echo actions taken in other countries where democracy has been declining. While Americans may have little sympathy for the soft hands and power suits of America’s corporate white-shoe law firms, legal experts warn that the stakes are that high. A fearful, compliant legal industry could open the door to more serious abuses of rights and freedoms.\n\n“There has always been a tradition of lawyers challenging the government,” says Leslie Levin, a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law. “This is attempting to make [them] reluctant to do that.”\n\nLeveraging government access\n\nIn late February, Mr. Trump issued a memo targeting Covington & Burling LLP. Noting that the firm had helped former special counsel Jack Smith, who brought two criminal prosecutions against the president, he instructed senior federal officials to revoke security clearances for the firm and to evaluate government contracts with Covington.\n\nThe following weeks brought executive orders targeting Perkins Coie LLP and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. Again, the firms have ties to Mr. Trump’s political opponents. Again, the orders revoked security clearances and ordered evaluations of their government work—even limiting access to federal buildings. Orders targeting two other firms have followed, along with a broader presidential memo calling for accountability for law firms and lawyers who threaten national security, public safety, or election integrity.\n\n“Democrats and their law firms weaponized the legal process to try to punish and jail their political opponents,” said Harrison Fields, White House principal deputy press secretary, in a statement.\n\nThe executive orders, he added, “are lawful directives to ensure that the President’s agenda is implemented and that law firms comply with the law.”\n\nThe orders are also designed to hit Big Law firms where it hurts most: their wallets. Firms typically take on major constitutional cases pro bono, so while they may have a big impact on American democracy, they have next to no impact on the bottom line. Big corporations are their most lucrative clients, and government access is a key selling point to that clientele. Losing that access means losing revenue.\n\nBut while each firm in Mr. Trump’s crosshairs faces similar risks, their responses have differed.\n\nThree firms have sued, arguing that the orders abridge constitutional rights to free speech, due process, and assistance of counsel. Four firms, meanwhile – including three that had not yet been targeted by Mr. Trump – have negotiated settlements with the White House. In exchange for tens of millions of dollars of pro bono work supporting the government’s causes, the firms will not be targeted by the president.\n\nExactly what is motivating firms to fight or bargain is unclear, but observers speculate that those with the most corporate revenue at stake are least likely to stand up to the government.\n\nMeanwhile, sources and news reports say that major firms are refusing to take certain cases that they believe could anger the White House. In court last week, a U.S. Department of Justice attorney said, “There certainly may be more” executive actions coming, Reuters reported.\n\nBig Law as big business\n\nThe extent to which some firms have folded at the first sign of danger is worrying to many lawyers and legal experts. But for others, firms are making understandable moves to avoid existential threats. Yet others say that they believe a political reckoning for the industry is overdue.\n\nAttorneys in Washington have expressed that it’s a delicate balance for law firms.\n\n“It’s easy to say in the abstract that you’d love them to fight back. But when your firm is targeted, it’s not abstract,” says one lawyer. “Employees’ jobs are on the line. The firm’s ability to advocate for clients is on the line. And we’re only two months into a four-year administration.”\n\nTwo companies that ranked among the 10 most profitable Big Law firms in recent years – Paul, Weiss and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom – negotiated agreements. Earlier this week Mr. Trump also announced agreements with Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, as well as Milbank LLP, which announced its deal Wednesday afternoon. Doug Emhoff, husband to Mr. Trump’s 2024 election opponent, Kamala Harris, is a partner at Willkie. Neal Katyal, a vocal Trump critic, is a partner at Milbank.\n\nPaul, Weiss Chairman Brad Karp, in a firm-wide email sent after its agreement became public, described the situation as an “existential crisis” that “could easily have destroyed” the company. He also criticized other law firms, which, instead of supporting them, he said, “aggressively solicit[ed] our clients and recruit[ed] our attorneys.”\n\nMr. Karp added that the agreement “will have no effect on our work and our shared cultural values.” The Trump administration, he continued, “is not dictating what matters we take on, approving our matters, or anything like that.”\n\nThomas Cerabino, Willkie’s chairman, echoed this sentiment in the White House’s announcement released Tuesday. “The substance of that agreement is consistent with our Firm’s views on access to Legal representation by clients ... and our history of working with clients across a wide spectrum of political viewpoints,” he wrote.\n\nAccording to a former partner at a major law firm who asked not to be named so he could speak candidly, negotiating agreements with the government is “an excellent business decision.”\n\n“Some firms were exceptionally zealous and provided a lot of aid to people supporting causes the Trump administration opposed or causes that were personally damaging to Trump or his supporters,” he adds. “I don’t see any problem with the Trump administration saying you should provide pro bono services for causes you don’t necessarily agree with – that has always been an ideal of the profession.”\n\nOther lawyers are worried about the precedent the agreements set, however, and the chilling effect it already appears to be having in the legal industry.\n\nProfits over ethics?\n\nCritics both inside and outside law firms say the firms are choosing money over morals and self-interest over the Constitution. For Rachel Cohen, who resigned from Skadden last week, this is an existential crisis – but it’s a crisis that requires a defense of the Constitution, not a negotiation.\n\n“I have made plenty of moral compromises before. But this moment is existential,” she wrote in a LinkedIn post two weeks ago.\n\n“If being on this career path demands I accept that my industry ... will allow an authoritarian government to ignore the courts,” she added, “I refuse to take it any further.”\n\nSome Big Law firms share her view. WilmerHale and Jenner & Block sued the Trump administration last week. Perkins – which says the executive order against it could cost the firm one-quarter of its total revenue – had already challenged the government.\n\nFederal judges have issued orders temporarily blocking parts of Mr. Trump’s orders against all three firms. The firms, judges said, face an immediate, concrete injury and are likely to succeed with their claims.\n\n“There is no doubt this retaliatory action chills speech and legal advocacy, or that it qualifies as a constitutional harm,” said Judge Richard Leon, who is overseeing the WilmerHale case.\n\nIn the Perkins case, the executive order appears to violate the First Amendment and the law firm’s due process rights, said Judge Beryl Howell, according to The Washington Post. “It sends little chills down my spine,” she added.\n\nIn addition to the possible constitutional violations, judicial rules already exist to address concerns of the Trump administration. Rule 11 in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure holds that pleadings in court must be “nonfrivolous” and cannot be “presented for any improper purpose.” If a party believes a law firm is weaponizing the justice system for political ends, for example, it can ask the judge to sanction the opposing party.\n\nIn targeting specific firms with executive orders, the Trump administration no longer needs Rule 11.\n\n“The whole point of these [orders] is they don’t have to ask the judge,” says Walter Olson, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute.\n\nIf the orders are upheld, he adds, “You have to worry, as a lawyer, that they’re going to come after you [just] because they don’t like the arguments you made.”\n\nA tilted playing field?\n\nThat is not how the U.S. legal system is supposed to operate, experts say. In what’s known as an adversarial system, it’s presumed that parties arrive in court on relatively equal footing in terms of resources and lawyering skills. At that point, the best arguments win, and justice is served.\n\nIf independent law firms are afraid of advocating for causes the federal government dislikes, the playing field is tilted even more in the government's favor. The best arguments may not win. Justice may not be served.\n\n“So many of the rights that we now take for granted were actually won by advocates in this system – going up against government lawyers often,” says Lindsay Langholz, senior director of policy and program at the American Constitution Society.\n\nThere is hope in how some firms are fighting back, legal experts say. But given the number of negotiated agreements, there is also skepticism. It appears that the industry best placed to fight for its rights against a grudge-fueled presidency with a maximalist view of its own power is doing so only cautiously.\n\n“I’m shocked and dismayed by how brittle these institutions have turned out to be,” says one lawyer at a major firm who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\n“This is about the fundamentals of who we are and the rule of law, and the fact people can’t see past their pockets for this. It’s a sad state of affairs,” the lawyer adds."

        "full_text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. government has banned American government personnel in China, as well as family members and contractors with security clearances, from any romantic or sexual relationships with Chinese citizens, The Associated Press has learned.\n\nFour people with direct knowledge of the matter told the AP about the policy, which was put into effect by departing U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Burns in January shortly before he left China. The people would speak only on condition of anonymity to discuss details of a confidential new directive.\n\nThough some U.S. agencies already had strict rules on such relationships, a blanket “non-fraternization” policy, as it is known, has been unheard of publicly since the Cold War. It’s not uncommon for American diplomats in other countries to date locals and even marry them.\n\nA more limited version of the policy was enacted last summer prohibiting U.S. personnel from “romantic and sexual relations” with Chinese citizens working as guards and other support staff at the U.S. Embassy and five consulates in China. But Burns, the departing ambassador, broadened it to a blanket ban on such relations with any Chinese citizen in China in January, days before President Donald Trump took office. The AP was unable to determine exactly how the policy defined the phrase “romantic or sexual relationship.”\n\nTwo of the people with knowledge of the ban told the AP the new policy was first discussed last summer after members of Congress contacted Burns to express concern that restrictions on such relationships were not stringent enough. The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe new policy covers U.S. missions in mainland China, including the embassy in Beijing and consulates in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shenyang and Wuhan, as well as the American consulate in the semi-autonomous territory of Hong Kong. It does not apply to U.S. personnel stationed outside China.\n\nThe only exception to the policy is U.S. personnel with pre-existing relations with Chinese citizens; they can apply for exemptions. If the exemption is denied, they must end the relationship or leave their position, the people said. Anyone who violates the policy will be ordered to leave China immediately.\n\nThe policy was communicated verbally and electronically to American personnel in China in January, but has not been publicly announced.\n\nThe State Department said it does not comment on internal matters. The National Security Council referred questions to the State Department. Burns, the former ambassador, did not reply to an AP request sent to his email address at The Cohen Group, a consultancy that he rejoined as vice chair in February.\n\nA Cold War throwback\n\nIntelligence services across the world have long used attractive men and women to obtain sensitive information, famously during the Cold War. The State Department and other agencies with offices in China have long had stringent reporting requirements on personal relationships for American personnel stationed there, as well as rivals considered high intelligence threats such as Russia or Cuba.\n\nDeclassified State Department documents show that in 1987, the U.S. government barred personnel stationed in the Soviet bloc and China from befriending, dating or having sex with locals after a U.S. Marine in Moscow was seduced by a Soviet spy. Such restrictions were relaxed after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, according to news reports at the time.\n\nIn China, a blanket ban on such relations has not been in effect for many years. Until the new ban in January, U.S. personnel in China were required to report any intimate contact with Chinese citizens to their supervisors, but were not explicitly forbidden from sexual or romantic relationships.\n\nU.S. diplomats and intelligence experts say that Beijing continues to aggressively use so-called honeypots to access American secrets. In presentations before being stationed in China, U.S. personnel are briefed on case studies where Chinese intelligence services sent attractive women to seduce American diplomats, and warned that dozens of Chinese state security agents can be assigned to monitor any individual diplomat of interest.\n\nLittle is known about the U.S. government’s non-fraternization policies elsewhere, as they are considered classified. It is unknown how restrictive such policies are in other countries.\n\nRising tensions, tighter controls\n\nIn recent years, tensions between Washington and Beijing have escalated over trade, technology and geopolitical competition.\n\nPeter Mattis, a former CIA analyst and president of The Jamestown Foundation, a Washington-based think tank, said there were at least two publicized cases in which Chinese agents seduced American diplomats stationed in China, though he hasn’t heard of such a case in recent years.\n\nMattis added that another issue is that Chinese state security doesn’t gather intelligence just through spies, but also by pressing ordinary Chinese people for information, often through threats or intimidation. That, Mattis said, means any Chinese citizen who dates an American diplomat could be vulnerable to coercion.\n\n“The MSS is willing to leverage any human connection that a target has to collect intelligence,” Mattis said, using an acronym referring to China’s Ministry of State Security. “This rule change suggests the MSS has gotten a lot more aggressive at trying to access the embassy and U.S. government.”\n\nThe Chinese foreign ministry did not comment on the ban, saying in a faxed statement that it was “more appropriate to ask the U.S. about this question.”\n\nChina also has been tightening already strict controls on its personnel overseas, according to Chinese regulations, news reports and four people familiar with China’s bureaucracy who spoke on condition of anonymity so they could discuss a sensitive topic. In recent years, Beijing began strictly enforcing regulations that bar promotions for Chinese civil servants with spouses who acquired foreign citizenship and restrict diplomats from spending an extended period of time in one country, forcing some to return to China.\n\nChina’s foreign ministry and many other government bodies bar their officials and staff from sexual or romantic relations with foreign citizens, while members of the Chinese military or police are generally barred from leaving China altogether without express approval from their supervisors.\n\n___\n\nKang reported from Beijing."

        "full_text": "Today is “Liberation Day,” according to President Donald Trump — the day he announces a slate of new tariffs. This is just the latest update to tariff policies that have already caused a good deal of whiplash since Trump took office in January. He threatened to impose tariffs on Colombia and canceled his plan to do so all in a single day. He rolled out a tariff plan for Canada and Mexico, only to postpone implementing it shortly after some tariffs went into effect. And he’s been threatening both allies and adversaries with broad and aggressive tariffs for reasons ranging from cracking down on fentanyl to closing a TikTok deal.\n\nThe chaotic nature of Trump’s tariff policies has unnerved investors, and the stock market has plummeted since the president made it clear that he’s not afraid of a trade war. It has also made tariffs look like an inherently bad idea.\n\nTo be fair, Trump’s tariff proposals are bad policy: They are far too broad, haphazard, and have confusing rationales.\n\nBut tariffs are not fundamentally unwise. “​​The reality is that tariffs can be, and have been, effective policy tools for promoting industrial development when they’re done in a targeted strategic way and when they are matched with other complementary policies,” said Adam Hersh, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.\n\nSo what would good tariff policies actually look like?\n\nWhen tariffs can be good\n\nA tariff is a tax that’s imposed on goods imported from other countries. Oftentimes, the cost is passed on to consumers because companies will raise their prices to offset the tax.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons countries would be interested in levying a tariff is to protect domestic industries from unfair competition. Take the example of Chinese steel. China, which heavily subsidizes its steel industry, produces more than half of the world’s steel. Because demand for steel within China has not kept pace with supply, Chinese steel has become much cheaper, potentially selling at a loss in international markets.\n\nThat makes it extremely difficult for steel manufacturers elsewhere to compete, which has prompted governments to respond. Last year, the Biden administration implemented tariffs aimed at curbing imports of Chinese steel in order to protect US manufacturers.\n\nAnother example of unfair competition comes from countries with bad labor standards and very low wages. If, for example, Chinese products are cheaper than American products in part because of extremely low labor costs, the US shouldn’t respond by lowering wages to keep local companies competitive. Instead of a race to the bottom, the US can respond by imposing tariffs on certain Chinese products. That allows American companies to pay their workers well without having to sacrifice their competitiveness in the market.\n\nTariffs work best when they are tailored to a specific problem. “We have to start by making strategic choices about, ‘What are the industries that are important to support with public policy?’” Hersh said. “That could be for a national security reason, it could be for an economic reason, it could be because of broader social goals like fighting the climate crisis.”\n\nOther times, a country might be interested in propping up a certain sector to make the supply chain more stable. If the United States is too reliant on other countries to provide certain goods, it can be caught in a crisis when supply chains are disrupted.\n\nThis was “a lesson learned painfully during the COVID-19 pandemic when everyone was scrambling to source personal protective equipment (PPE), respirators, and critical medicines unavailable domestically at the necessary scale,” Hersh wrote in an article with Josh Bivens, the chief economist at the Economic Policy Institute. Tariffs, in other words, can help ensure that there isn’t a monopoly over crucial imports so that supply chains aren’t completely disrupted in the event of war or, as we learned in 2020, a pandemic.\n\nWhy Trump’s tariff policy is misguided\n\nOn his first day back in the White House, Trump announced that he would try to build a whole new agency called the “External Revenue Service” to collect taxes on imports. “His goal is very simple: to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and let all the outsiders pay,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox News in February.\n\nBut while tariffs were a main source of revenue for the US government before it introduced federal income taxes in 1913, Trump’s supposed plan to replace the IRS with an External Revenue Service is a terrible idea. For starters, tariffs essentially act as a flat tax on spending, which ultimately puts a higher burden on lower-income consumers. It’s also impossible for tariffs to raise nearly as much money as income tax.\n\nThis strategy also highlights why Trump’s tariff proposals are so poorly planned: He simultaneously wants to raise a significant amount of money from tariffs while also pledging to get rid of tariffs if other countries agree to his terms.\n\nTrump’s tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada, for example, were placed in part, he says, to stop fentanyl from flowing into the United States. So what would happen if those countries end up meeting Trump’s demands? If Trump’s plan is just to raise revenue, then clearly he wouldn’t want to come to an agreement with those countries. If his plan is to curb fentanyl, then he clearly doesn’t want tariffs to be a permanent source of revenue.\n\n“The Trump administration has not been targeted or strategic. They have so many different rationales for why they’re pursuing tariffs, not all of them have to do with industrial revitalization,” Hersh said.\n\nThe broad-based approach is also expected to be seriously disruptive, spiking prices on all kinds of products all at once. Even Trump seemed to suggest that would be the case. “WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!),” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social, his social media platform. “BUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID.”\n\nAnother problem is that Trump seemingly believes that tariffs can stand on their own. But tariffs in and of themselves are not a solution. To be effective at protecting American companies and jobs, tariffs should be coupled with other policies that help spur investments.\n\nTrump has proposed repealing the CHIPS and Science Act, which former President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022. The law invested tens of billions of dollars in America’s semiconductor industry by subsidizing companies that want to build new manufacturing facilities in the United States and by funding research and development.\n\nIf Trump is actually interested in using tariffs productively, he should start by first figuring out what his policy objectives actually are. He could also turn to his predecessor for answers. The Biden administration’s approach to propping up the semiconductor industry, for example, was to impose some tariffs in addition to the CHIPS Act, using tariffs as just one tool of many to support industry growth. Trump, by contrast, wants to just rely on tariffs without committing to long-term investments. That won’t deliver the same goal.\n\nUltimately, it’s important to remember that just because Trump’s approach to tariffs is bombastic and unpredictable, that shouldn’t necessarily be a reflection on tariffs more broadly. At the end of the day, tariffs exist for a reason, and, if implemented well, they can be a beneficial tool to shore up jobs, promote better wages, and advance national interests. “We can’t judge the tool,” Hersh said, “by the craftsman that is mishandling it.”"

        "full_text": "Just a few months ago, Republicans were triumphant, while Democrats were demoralized. But something real has happened: Democrats’ fury is building. Perhaps they have had it with Elon Musk. Perhaps Senate Democrats’ capitulation on government funding ignited voters who felt abandoned by their party leaders. Perhaps it was all the institutions cutting deals under pressure from President Trump. Whatever it was, Democrats are proving a political axiom: Anger is a more powerful motivator in voting than happiness and satisfaction.\n\nAnd Republicans had better watch out, as they learned Tuesday night in a Wisconsin statewide election for a State Supreme Court seat, in which the Democratic-backed candidate prevailed by 10 percentage points just five months after Mr. Trump beat Kamala Harris there by just one point.\n\nAs a pollster, I’ve been focused recently on gauging what voters think of Mr. Trump’s performance back in office. One way to do this is by asking if they approve or disapprove of the job he is doing across a range of issues — a metric that in the past few weeks showed gently declining but overall middling approval ratings.\n\nBut I think studying how voters feel is also important — maybe even more important than studying what they think. In my polling, when I ask voters how they feel about what the Trump administration is doing, Democrats are not simply dissatisfied. When I offered voters a range of seven emotions in a poll in mid-March, from “furious” to “thrilled,” the top response from Democrats was “furious,” at 38 percent. Only a quarter of Republicans described themselves as “thrilled,” by contrast (though, make no mistake, Republicans support Mr. Trump a great deal).\n\nWhat should worry Republicans most is that when a party wins elections and its supporters are satisfied with what their side is doing, it becomes easy to rest on one’s laurels and miss the bubbling rage of the other side or not find ways to counter it. Democrats did this, to some extent, during the rise of the Tea Party movement, dismissing it as AstroTurf — activism masquerading as grass-roots energy — and paying dearly for it in the first Obama midterms, in 2010. Republicans may wish to dismiss some of what they see appearing at angry town hall meetings, but this isn’t just the usual anger of an opposition party: Mr. Trump is supercharging the anger in two important ways that add up to even greater potential peril for Republicans in the short run.\n\nThe first factor is the nature of Mr. Trump’s policy pushes, such as new tariffs and the mass firings of government employees, which can cause immediate problems for families, consumers and business leaders, with the only balm being his vague assurances of an ensuing upside. This is exactly the kind of dynamic that deepens the frustration and anger of a large group of very personally affected voters, who will seek to send a message.\n\nThe other factor is Mr. Trump’s reshaping of the Republican coalition to rely more heavily on what we in the business call low-propensity voters. Analysts at Split Ticket found, for instance, that the Trump era has brought a number of voters to the Republican cause who are not the most reliable at turning out when he is not on the ballot. Add all this together, and you have all the makings of a tougher road ahead for Republicans, potentially leading to rough midterm elections in 2026.\n\nThough Republicans held two congressional seats in Florida this week in special elections, they did so by far narrower margins than the G.O.P. typically enjoys in those districts. Spooked about special elections, Mr. Trump pulled his nomination of Representative Elise Stefanik as U.N. ambassador because he didn’t want to take a chance that Democrats would flip her seat in the House, despite her double-digit margins of victory in her district for the past decade.\n\nSo given Republican triumphalism in the 2024 elections, why the sudden shift? It all comes down to emotions and the relative intensity of negative versus positive emotions in politics today. Republicans have struggled in the Trump era during elections without him on the ballot, succumbing to a Democratic opposition that is highly animated to turn out against Republicans when he is in power.\n\nThe 2018 elections during Mr. Trump’s first term saw a blue wave, in which Democrats picked up 41 seats in the House and returned the speaker’s gavel to Nancy Pelosi. But even before that, Republicans managed to lose a Senate race in Alabama, of all places, ceding Jeff Sessions’s vacated seat to the Democratic candidate, Doug Jones. Mr. Jones was elevated by high turnout in the bluest pockets across the state, defeating a divisive opponent as voters angry with Mr. Trump sought to send a message to Washington.\n\nIf Democrats winning statewide in Alabama seems strange, so is a Republican statewide victory in Massachusetts. In January 2010, after the death of Senator Edward Kennedy, a wave of anger toward the Obama administration led to the Republican candidate, Scott Brown, defeating the Democrat, Martha Coakley, by a nearly five-point margin. His election threw a wrench into the Democratic-controlled Congress’s process for advancing the Affordable Care Act and foreshadowed a huge red wave.\n\nA look at polling from 2010 showed all the signs of the coming wave. Shortly after Mr. Brown’s victory, the Pew Research Center found Republican voters 12 points more likely than Democrats to say they were “certain” to vote. It also found that the independents who had the most intense dissatisfaction with government were the most likely to say they were “certain” to vote, and those independents favored the Republican Party by a wide margin. As Election Day approached, Pew found that Republicans — especially Tea Party-aligned Republicans — were much more likely than Democrats to report feeling angry about political news or to say that “this year’s elections are more important than most.”\n\nIn 2018 a similar pattern emerged: Democratic-leaning voters were especially angry about the prospect of Republicans being in power. When Pew asked voters how they would feel about different possible results of the midterms, those who supported Democratic candidates were more likely to say they’d be “angry” if their side lost or “excited” if their side won. (After the election, it found that only 11 percent of Republicans were angry that they’d lost the House; most were simply disappointed.)\n\nIt is notable that in 2022, when the red wave fizzled, some surveys showed there was not the same kind of anger gap Republicans benefited from in 2010. Data from Morning Consult at the time showed Republicans and Democrats about equally likely to say they felt angry about things heading into those midterms.\n\nNot all political scientists necessarily agree that anger is a turnout booster. While some research showed that voters who are induced to be angry can be turned out at higher rates, other researchers found that “the most common reactions to political anger are withdrawal and inaction,” according to The Washington Post. It added, “Many fewer Americans’ anger pushes them to get politically engaged.” And to be sure, there has been anecdotal evidence suggesting that the resistance during Mr. Trump’s first term has been more muted this time — fewer large marches, fewer celebrities talking politics at awards shows, less backlash from corporate America.\n\nBut the data is clear: Democratic voters are enraged by what is happening in Washington. Republicans may say, “Well, good! That’s a feature, not a bug, of the changes Mr. Trump is pursuing.” But the new coalition he has fashioned for the Republican Party is ever more dependent on less reliable voters, meaning a fired-up opposition has a greater and greater advantage, especially in special elections and others with lower turnout.\n\nBeing out of power and being incensed at those who are in charge seem to be highly motivational. Right now, it is Democratic voters and those who are upset by what they see in Washington who are the most activated. Republicans may be pleased with where the country is heading, but they may find themselves facing wave after wave of anger slamming hard into their eddies of satisfaction at the ballot box."

        "full_text": "Punitive or a gift? How five big economies see new Trump tariffs\n\nNew trade tariffs unveiled by US President Donald Trump on Wednesday are expected to have a major global impact, and have been condemned by the European Union and other key US allies.\n\nBut Trump's latest import taxes may get a different response in China, whose leader could see them as a gift.\n\nHere, BBC reporters in five major economies look at the nuances of how the announcements are being received where they are.\n\nEurope could hurt US, but doesn't want to escalate\n\nBy Katya Adler, Europe editor in Brussels\n\nEuropean Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen spoke on behalf of all European Union (EU) countries when she said the new tax imports would cause \"dire\" consequences for millions of people around the globe.\n\nShe said there was \"no clear path through the complexity and chaos\" that the new tariffs would unleash worldwide.\n\nBut the Commission has promised to protect EU businesses, some of which will be more hard hit than others - like Germany's car industry, Italy's luxury goods and France's wine and champagne producers.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has called an emergency meeting of French business leaders later on Thursday.\n\nAs the biggest single market in the world, the EU can hurt the US - targeting goods and services, including 'big tech' like Apple and Meta with counter-measures.\n\nBut it says its aim is not to up the ante here – it's to persuade Trump to negotiate.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Italian PM Georgia Meloni said that while she considered the tariffs wrong, everything would be done to try and reach an agreement with the US.\n\nTariffs a gift for Chinese leader\n\nBy Stephen McDonell, China correspondent in Beijing\n\nA 54% tariff hit on Chinese goods entering the US is certainly huge and will no doubt hurt Chinese companies trying to sell into that market.\n\nBeijing's countermeasures will also hurt US companies trying to reach the massive Chinese market.\n\nBut, in one way, these moves from Trump are also a gift to Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nXi is portraying his country as a champion of free trade, a backer of multilateral institutions, and making comparisons with the world's other superpower which is seen as trashing both of these.\n\nJust last week, China's leader was sitting down with chief executives from big international corporations – including many from Europe – and the imagery was clear. The US under Donald Trump = chaos, trade destruction, national self-interest. China under Xi Jinping = stability, free trade, global cooperation.\n\nThe Chinese government has already mobilised its state media sector to attack this latest round of tariffs from the Trump Administration.\n\nPeople may quibble with the Chinese Communist Party's reading of where the world sits, but every time Trump takes measures like these, it makes Xi's sales pitch easier to deliver.\n\nAnd economic necessity may draw many countries closer to China and further from the US.\n\nAre Trump's Asia tariffs a 'full-frontal assault' on China?\n\n'Not the act of a friend': Australia angry over tariffs\n\nWhat Trump has done - and why it matters\n\nSome relief but no delight in UK\n\nBy Chris Mason, BBC political editor in London\n\nFolks in government here had picked up a sense of the mood music – a sense that the UK was \"in the good camp rather than the bad camp\" as one figure put it to me – but they had no idea in advance what that would mean exactly.\n\nBut now we do know - a 10% tariff on the UK's exports to the US.\n\nI detect a sense of relief among ministers, but make no mistake - they are not delighted. The tariffs imposed on the UK will have significant effects, and the tariffs on the UK's trading partners will have a profound impact on jobs, industries and global trading flows in the weeks, months and years to come.\n\nIt will be \"hugely disruptive,\" as one government source put it.\n\nThere is an acute awareness in particular about the impact on the car industry.\n\nNegotiations with the US over a trade deal continue. I am told a team of four UK negotiators are in \"pretty intensive\" conversation with their US counterparts – talking remotely, but willing to head to Washington if signing a deal appears imminent.\n\nRead more from Chris Mason: UK ministers stay up late for Trump announcements\n\nIndia fears impacts - but some sectors have hope\n\nBy Nikhil Inamdar, India business correspondent in Delhi\n\nAsian economies are among the hardest hit by Trump's new tariffs. Americans will have to pay a 46% tax on imported goods from Vietnam, and 49% for goods from Cambodia.\n\nRelatively speaking, India has fared better.\n\nBut a 26% across-the-board tariff rate is still steep, and will severely affect major \"labour-intensive exports\", says Priyanka Kishore of the Asia Decoded consultancy.\n\n\"That will likely have a knock-on impact on domestic demand and headline gross domestic product(GDP)\" at a time when growth is already stuttering, according to Kishore.\n\nBut India's electronics exports may potentially benefit as higher tariffs on rivals such as Vietnam could leads to the re-routing of trade.\n\nThat is unlikely to mitigate the overall negative growth impact of Trump's salvo though.\n\nUnlike Canada, Mexico or the European Union, India has so far adopted a conciliatory approach to Trump and is negotiating a bilateral deal with the US. Whether this triggers a retaliation in Delhi, will be very closely watched.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry - which accounts for India's largest industrial exports at some $13bn (£9.9bn) annually - will be breathing a sigh of relief, however, as medicines are exempt from these \"reciprocal\" tariffs.\n\nCan Trump' tariffs spark manufacturing boom in India?\n\nSouth Africa hits out, as continent reels from aid cuts"

        "full_text": "President Donald Trump made a series of false claims about tariffs and trade – most of which he has made before – in the Wednesday speech in which he announced a sweeping set of global tariffs.\n\nHere is a fact check of some of Trump’s remarks.\n\nCanada’s dairy tariffs\n\nTrump correctly noted that Canada has tariffs exceeding 250% on some US dairy products. However, he falsely claimed that merely “the first little carton of milk” exported to Canada faces a “very low price,” but “then it gets up to 275, 300%.”\n\nIn reality, Canada has guaranteed that tens of thousands of metric tons of imported US milk per year, not merely a single carton, will face zero tariffs at all; Canada conceded a certain guaranteed level of tariff-free US access to its dairy market as part of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) that Trump’s own first administration negotiated.\n\nTrump also didn’t mention something the US dairy industry acknowledges: The US is not hitting its zero-tariff maximum level of exports to Canada in any category of dairy product, so the Canadian tariffs aren’t being applied; with regard to milk in particular, the US isn’t even at half of the tariff-free quota. (There is a vigorous US-Canada debate about why the US is so far from the maximum, with each country blaming the other. Regardless of who’s right, the tariffs aren’t hitting US milk.)\n\nTrump has persistently omitted key facts about Canada’s dairy tariffs. You can read more here from a previous CNN fact check.\n\nUS trade deficit with Canada\n\nTrump, claiming “we subsidize a lot of countries,” falsely said “it’s close to $200 billion a year” with Canada. Trump has repeatedly used this $200 billion figure to describe the US trade deficit with Canada in particular, which is actually far lower than $200 billion; official US statistics show the 2024 deficit with Canada in goods and services trade was $35.7 billion and $70.6 billion in goods trade alone.\n\nTrump didn’t mention the trade deficit in particular this time, but even if he was intending to use the word “subsidize” more broadly, there is no basis for the claim.\n\nWho pays tariffs\n\nTrump repeated his frequent false claim that, because of the tariffs he imposed on China during his first term, the US “took in hundreds of billions of dollars” that “they paid.” In fact, US importers, not foreign exporters like China, make the tariff payments, and study after study has found that Americans bore the overwhelming majority of the cost of Trump’s first-term tariffs on China; it’s easy to find specific examples of companies that passed along the cost of the tariffs to US consumers.\n\nPrevious presidents’ tariffs on China\n\nTrump also repeated his frequent false claim that, before his first presidency, China “never paid 10 cents to any other president” from tariffs. Aside from the fact that US importers make the tariff payments, the US was actually generating billions per year in revenue from tariffs on Chinese imports before Trump took office; in fact, the US has had tariffs on Chinese imports since 1789. Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, imposed additional tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nUS wealth\n\nTouting the supposed benefits of tariffs, Trump claimed that “the United States was proportionately the wealthiest it has ever been” from 1789 to 1913, when tariffs made up a higher percentage of federal revenue before the passage of a 1913 law reestablishing the federal income tax.\n\nTrump didn’t explain what he meant by “proportionately the wealthiest,” but by standard measures, the US is far wealthier today than it was in the early 20th century and prior. Per capita gross domestic product is now many times higher than it was then.\n\nDouglas Irwin, a Dartmouth College economics professor who studies the history of US trade policy, said in February after Trump had made similar claims, that if Trump’s unclear comments are interpreted to be about per capita income, as “economists usually take this,” it is “obviously not true,” since “real per capita income and standards of living are so much higher today than the past. … It is nice to have indoor plumbing, running water, not outhouses, etc.”\n\nIrwin noted then that it’s possible Trump had been referring to how the federal government after the Civil War “ran consistent budget surpluses and almost paid off the national debt,” since “he seems to view the government taking in more money than it is spending as making the country rich.” Irwin added, though, that “big fiscal surpluses don’t make a country rich, per se.”\n\nInflation under Biden and Trump\n\nTrump falsely claimed that, during Joe Biden’s presidency, the US had “the highest” inflation “in the history of our country.” Trump could have fairly said that the year-over-year US inflation rate hit a 40-year high in June 2022, when it was 9.1%, but that was not close to the all-time record of 23.7%, set in 1920. (And the rate then plummeted. Inflation in the last full month of the Biden administration, December 2024, was 2.9%; it was 3% in January 2025, a month partly under Biden and partly under Trump.)\n\nTrump also claimed that there was “virtually no inflation” during his first presidency. He gave himself some wiggle room with the word “virtually,” but it’s worth noting that there was inflation during his first four years in office; prices rose about 8% from the beginning of that presidency to the end. Year-over-year inflation was 1.4% in the month he left office, January 2021.\n\nGas prices\n\nTrump, claiming he has brought prices “way down” since taking office again in late January, said that “gasoline is way under $3.” That is true in some parts of the country, but the national average for regular gasoline on the day he spoke was about $3.24 per gallon, according to data published by AAA – higher than on Trump’s inauguration day, when the AAA national average was about $3.12.\n\nThat’s not to say Trump is responsible for the increase; presidents have a limited impact on gas prices, and there was a larger increase over the equivalent period last year. But the national average has not fallen during this presidency to date.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details."

Chan, the San Francisco-based FBI special agent tasked with interacting with social media companies, there was a “gag order” on discussion of Hunter Biden’s laptop. In a separate exchange, Chan is told “official response no commen(t).”\n\nIn the chat, the FBI officials showed awareness that the laptop may have contained evidence of criminal activity.\n\nAsked Chan, “actually what kind of case is the laptop thing? corruption? campaign financing?”\n\nAnother FBI employee responds, “CLOSE HOLD —” after which the response is redacted.\n\nTo which Chan responds, “oh crap” appearing to underscore the serious nature of the probe, which included felony tax charges. Chan adds, “ok. It ends here”.\n\n[…]\n\nAccording to the IRS whistleblowers, DOJ prosecutors blocked standard investigative protocols that might have led to Joe Biden ahead of the presidential campaign.\n\n“There were a lot of overt investigative steps that we were not allowed to take because we had an upcoming election,” said Joseph Ziegler, the IRS case agent on the Hunter Biden probe.. “And it related to the president's son. So not even the candidate.”\n\nThe FBI chat is cryptic and the heavy redactions make it difficult to discern context. For example, an employee says to Chan that “[redacted] has a gag order from [redacted]... got checked by [redacted] had to backtrack - sorry!”\n\n[…]\n\nShapley added, “It was misinformation to try to make something else look like misinformation.”\n\nThe IRS whistleblowers [Gary Shapley and Joseph Zeigler], who were recently elevated to IRS headquarters to support badly needed cultural change at the Agency, said federal investigators “corroborated” early in the case that ‘The Big Guy’ on Hunter Biden’s laptop was then candidate Joe Biden.\n\n[…]\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Catherine Herridge Reports after Hunter Biden’s guilty plea to felony tax charges last fall, the IRS whistleblowers said the FBI, IRS, and Justice Department knew immediately the Hunter Biden laptop was real."

Trump is running on bringing back manufacturing, people said we know that, and we went and pulled the lever for them. This is mind boggling to me that the media is focused on pain, pain, pain. Listen to me, I heard someone earlier today on another network say countries send us wine, cheese and Mercedes and we give them a piece of paper, as if we are getting the better end of the bargain. People sweat, they work hard, they sacrifice families, families are broken up, people commit crimes for this piece of paper, it represents an investment, our life, our energy, it represents a lot. So we send it over there and we get all this plastic crap on this table. You know how that money comes back to this table, they buy this building, they buy our farms. This system is unsustainable.

Is it patriotic so that my kids can't afford to go to college, I don't have a retirement, I don't have a decent home, is that patriotic?

        "full_text": "Last week, ABC, CBS, and NBC spent nearly 100 minutes covering leaked messages from a private Signal chat for Trump administration officials, in just the first 96 hours after the messages were published. But those same networks spent only 13 minutes covering the actual military operation that was discussed in those leaked messages.\n\nIn mid-March, the United States launched a still-ongoing series of airstrikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen, in retaliation for more than 100 reported attacks on merchant vessels in the Red Sea. The operation, which would ultimately prove successful, initially received moderate coverage from broadcast networks ABC, CBS, and NBC — until two weeks later, when Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg published screenshots showing Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and other U.S. officials discussing the strikes in a private Signal chat.\n\nThe broadcast networks, which had long since dropped their light coverage of the strikes, immediately flooded the airwaves with the “Signalgate” story. That night, all three networks front-loaded their evening newscasts with lengthy reports about the mishap. In that single evening, the networks devoted more combined air time to the Signal messages than they’d spent on the airstrikes for the entire duration of the military operation two weeks prior.\n\nMRC analysts examined the first 96 hours of coverage on ABC, CBS, and NBC’s flagship morning and evening news shows, for both the air strikes (the evening of March 15 through the morning of March 19) and the Signal messages (the evening of March 24 through the morning of March 28). The “Signalgate” story received a whopping 99 minutes and 40 seconds across all three networks, while the combined total time spent on the Yemen airstrikes totaled just 13 minutes and 47 seconds.\n\nIn aggregate, that comes out to 7.2 times more coverage for the leaked chat messages. But that ratio would have been significantly higher without ABC, which spent both the least time on the Signal story (31 minutes and 53 seconds), and the most on the airstrikes (9 minutes, 20 seconds).\n\nCBS, meanwhile, gave a colossal 16 times more coverage to the Signal story (35 minutes, nine seconds, versus two minutes, 12 seconds). Things weren’t much better on NBC, which devoted 14.5 times more coverage to Signal (32 minutes, 38 seconds, versus two minutes, 15 seconds).\n\nThe Signal story broke on March 24, when Goldberg revealed he had been added inadvertently to a private group chat by National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. As of this piece’s publishing, Waltz continues to maintain that he did not add any journalists to the group, but Goldberg published screenshots proving he did manage to gain entry.\n\nTo say the least, it’s newsworthy that a journalist was able to gain access to a private channel in which officials were discussing an ongoing military operation. But fortunately, the operation itself was not affected by Goldberg’s presence in the chat, and it was executed without incident and with no casualties.\n\nIf the broadcast networks who relentlessly covered this Signal debacle were seriously interested in the national security angle, one might expect they’d have paid a similar amount of attention to the actual airstrikes that were discussed in the leaked messages. But that’s not what the numbers bear out.\n\nInstead, they ran a deluge of reports about an incompetently-managed group chat, but showed nowhere near the same level of interest in the competently-executed military operation underpinning the whole story."

        "full_text": "The progressive fundraising platform ActBlue changed its donation policies twice during the 2024 election cycle to make its standards “more lenient” and received donations from foreign sources, a congressional investigation has found.\n\nThree House Committees launched probes last year after reviewing evidence that the platform accepted donations from foreign sources and employed lax verification standards.\n\n“Internal documents produced to the Committees by ActBlue and its fraud-prevention contractor, Sift, demonstrate a lack of commitment to stopping fraud and paint a picture of complacency on ActBlue’s fraud-prevention team,” the committees concluded in an interim report made public on Wednesday. “Put simply, the documents reflect a fundamentally unserious approach to fraud prevention at ActBlue—one that has left the door open for large-scale fraud campaigns on Democrats’ top fundraising platform.”\n\nDuring the 2024 campaign cycle, according to internal company documents reviewed by the committee, ActBlue issued new standards encouraging staff to “look for reasons to accept contributions.” Before this policy change, the platform already failed to require CVV numbers for credit card transactions, increasing fraud risks, the committees previously found.\n\nAn internal assessment from the company, the investigation found, determined the policy change led to “between 14 and 28 additional fraudulent contributions each month.”\n\nThe platform also began to monitor potential fraudulent donations from several foreign sources, including hundreds of donations from Brazil, Colombia, India, Iraq, the Philippines and Saudi Arabia, and other countries, an internal memo shows.\n\n“Look out for these donations: Giving to Center for American Progress Action Fund,” the memo reads. “Mostly from Brazilian donors (unlikely to give to this organization).”\n\nYou can read the interim report below:\n\nBetween September 2022 and November 2024, ActBlue recorded up to 1,900 fraudulent transactions in total, but the report authors claim the suspicious donations are far more “widespread.”\n\n“Altogether, ActBlue’s internal documents and communications paint a damning picture: despite repeated instances of fraudulent donations to Democrat campaigns and causes from domestic and foreign sources, ActBlue is not demonstrating a serious effort to deter fraud on its platform,” the committees concluded.\n\nThe committees also floated potential legal consequences stemming from ActBlue’s behaviors identified in the interim report.\n\n“At best, ActBlue’s conduct displays a profound disrespect for the principle that only Americans should decide American elections. At worst, it may violate the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), which states that persons who ‘knowingly accept a contribution made by one person in the name of another person’ may face criminal liability.”"

        "full_text": "President Trump on Wednesday imposed a baseline tariff of 10% on all imports and additional, reciprocal levies on “worst-offender” nations in a bold restructuring of the global trading order he views as fundamentally unfair to the U.S. and calamitous for its workers.\n\nMr. Trump said the reciprocal tariffs will be roughly half the combined rate other nations charge on U.S. goods through tariffs and other barriers “because we are being very kind.” China’s rate of 67% would be met with a 34% rate from the U.S., and the EU’s 39% rate would be met with a 20% rate.\n\nThe president said he had no choice but to fight back against nations that “looted” and “pillaged” U.S. taxpayers, fulfilling his decades-long belief that bigger tariffs would be a salve for America’s wounded manufacturing base.\n\n“This is [the] Liberation Day we’ve been waiting for a long time,” he said at an event in the White House Rose Garden that featured Cabinet members and blue-collar workers in jackets and helmets.\n\nThe president promised that “jobs and factories will come roaring back to our country.”\n\nThe baseline tariffs will go into effect Saturday, and the reciprocal regime will take effect on April 9.​ Mr. Trump confirmed that his 25% tariff on automobiles made outside the U.S. would go into effect at midnight​ Wednesday, prompting cheers from workers in the audience.\n\nSEE ALSO: Senate rebukes Trump’s tariffs on Canada in bid to roll back presidential emergency powers\n\nTo justify the levies, Mr. Trump is declaring a national emergency over U.S. trade deficits with other nations that total more than $1 trillion. Mr. Trump and his team say they are being lenient, imposing new taxes on foreign goods that remain lower than the tariff levels those nations impose on U.S. products.\n\n“They do it to us, and we do it to them. Very simple, can’t get any simpler than that,” Mr. Trump said. “We’re going to take care of our people first.”\n\nStill, the plan is arguably the most seismic trade move by the U.S. since World War II. Some economists warn that the plan is a huge gamble that will raise prices and increase the risk of a recession.\n\nTariffs are taxes or duties paid by importers on goods from foreign markets.\n\nMr. Trump said his plan is simple: If you tax our products, we’ll hit back. Yet he is embarking on a grand experiment.\n\nThe plan hinges on the belief that getting tough with trading partners will recalibrate markets in favor of U.S. industry and workers as companies move production onshore to avoid tariffs or force consumers to opt for American-made goods.\n\nThe White House released a bevy of studies and reports Wednesday showing how Mr. Trump’s first-term tariffs spurred U.S. production. It also pointed to recent investments in the U.S. by chipmakers, Asian automakers and other companies.\n\nMr. Trump, in part, is trying to leverage the massive U.S. consumer market, which accounts for 29% of global consumer spending at more than $20 trillion per year, or more than twice the European Union’s annual spending.\n\nHe said foreign producers expect unfettered access to this American “piggy bank” but impose hefty trade barriers on U.S. producers trying to sell their products abroad, including a 39% tariff on American beef going to Japan and Canadian levies on American dairy that exceed 200%.\n\nMr. Trump said the U.S. typically charges a 2.4% tariff on motorcycles, Thailand charges about 60% on U.S. motorcycles, and India charges 70%. He said the European Union restricts U.S. poultry exports and Australia won’t “take any of our beef.”\n\nThe president said he doesn’t blame other countries for playing hardball but former presidents should have responded.\n\nMr. Trump used a large chart to detail new tariff rates for the dozens of countries on his reciprocal list. He included a 30% tariff on South African products in response to the 60% tax it imposes on U.S. goods. Cambodian goods face a 49% tariff after the White House determined it taxes U.S. goods at 97%.\n\n“Oh, look at Cambodia!” Mr. Trump said.\n\nEconomists say Mr. Trump might win concessions through bilateral negotiations. Israel dropped its remaining tariffs on U.S. goods on the eve of Mr. Trump’s announcement.\n\nYet the White House signaled it is even more concerned about trade barriers beyond tariffs. Other nations are expected to respond with tit-for-tat retaliation by imposing new levies on U.S. goods.\n\n“Europe did not start the tariff confrontation. Tariffs are taxes, paid by the people,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Tuesday. “But Europe has everything to protect our people and our prosperity. We will always promote & defend our interests and values.”\n\nMexico showed restraint, saying it doesn’t plan to engage in tit-for-tat tactics.\n\n“We do not believe in an eye-for-an-eye, a tooth-for-a-tooth because that always leads to a bad situation,” Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Wednesday during a press conference.\n\nA trade war, however, threatens to add costs to the supply chain, translating into higher consumer costs on clothes, food, electronics and other items. It also undercuts Mr. Trump’s campaign pledge to tame inflation.\n\nAlthough trading partners might suffer more than Americans, “it would still hurt the United States,” said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation.\n\n“Tariffs and retaliation will shrink U.S. GDP, the real value of after-tax income for U.S. households, and export opportunities for U.S.-based companies,” she said. “Globally, about three-fourths of total purchasing power and about 95% of consumers are outside of America — vitally important markets for U.S. businesses to sell to, and cutting that off through a trade war will bring economic pain here.”\n\nDemocrats said the tariffs are new taxes on goods that lower-income consumers buy. They said Republicans are trying to raise revenue and free up budget space for tax cuts that benefit wealthier people.\n\n“Life is about to become far more expensive, and Donald Trump — the billionaire who promised to bring down inflation on Day 1 — says he could not care less if you have to pay more,” said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat. “Why is Donald Trump so dead set on starting this ill-conceived trade war? Simply to pay for his tax breaks for billionaires.”\n\nWashington State Treasurer Mike Pellicciotti, a Democrat, said a trade war will make fertilizer more expensive for farmers and companies that rely on export markets will be impeded by retaliatory measures from other nations.\n\n“We are getting hit on both sides here in Washington,” he said.\n\nAlthough it is unclear how the tariffs will play out, the uncertainty makes Wall Street jittery because consumers might slow spending or employers might cut jobs if they cannot absorb higher costs.\n\nStocks traded in positive territory as details of Mr. Trump’s plan remained under wraps, though the specter of levies has roiled markets for weeks.\n\nEarlier this year, Mr. Trump imposed new tariffs on Chinese goods and a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports. He imposed 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, citing unchecked migration and fentanyl trafficking, only to pause levies on a host of goods covered by the North American trade agreement he negotiated in his first term.\n\nPresidents can impose tariffs without Congress in certain situations, such as to protect national security or address international emergencies.\n\nThe U.S. relied on tariffs as a primary source of government revenue until the federal income tax was imposed in the early 20th century.\n\nForeign countries don’t pay tariffs directly to the U.S. Treasury, despite Mr. Trump’s general assertion that he is taxing other nations.\n\nThe importers of record pay the levies — in many cases, U.S. companies — and they might pass on at least some of the cost to consumers through higher prices.\n\nMr. Trump is promoting tariffs to protect American workers while raising plenty of revenue for the U.S., though the goals could ultimately be at odds. If tariffs force more domestic production in place of imports, then tariff revenue would decline.\n\n“The White House has not been clear whether their aim is permanent revenues, permanent protection, or temporary tariffs for negotiation,” Ms. York said. “It’s contradictory to claim all three of those purposes as the aim because they each require different policy actions.”\n\nWhatever the aim, Mr. Trump is acting on a years-long belief that tariffs can restore American greatness, said Ross Baker, a politics professor at Rutgers University.\n\n“For a president who is criticized for having no fixed ideology,” he said, “tariffs do seem to be something he truly believes in.”"

        "full_text": "Hungary will withdraw from the International Criminal Court (ICC), its government said Wednesday, as the country’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban welcomed Israeli Prime Minister and ICC fugitive Benjamin Netanyahu to Budapest.\n\nSpeaking alongside Netanyahu in Budapest, Orban said his government decided to leave the court because it has become “a political tool.”\n\n“This very important court has been diminished to a political tool and Hungary wishes to play no role in it,” Orban told reporters during the joint news conference.\n\nNetanyahu praised the decision as “bold and principled,” praising Hungary for its “proud” support for Israel.\n\n“This is important not just for us, but for all democracies … it’s important to stand up to this corrupt organization,” he said. The Israeli PM said he expects Hungary to be the first, but not last country to walk away from the court.\n\nThe leaders delivered their short statements without taking any questions.\n\nNetanyahu’s visit to Hungary marked the first time the Israeli leader stepped foot on European soil since the ICC issued an arrest warrant against him and his former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as against three top officials of Hamas, in November 2024.\n\nThe court said it had “reasonable grounds” to believe Netanyahu bears criminal responsibility for war crimes including “starvation as a method of warfare” and “the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts.”\n\nNetanyahu dismissed the warrant as “absurd and antisemitic.”\n\n“Israel utterly rejects the absurd and false actions and accusations against it by the International Criminal Court, which is a politically biased and discriminatory body,” his office said at the time.\n\nThe ICC doesn’t have its own law enforcement powers, so it relies on its member states to make arrests and transfer suspects to the Hague. As a signatory of the Rome Statute, which established the court in 2002, Hungary is obliged to arrest Netanyahu.\n\nBut instead, Netanyahu got a warm welcome in the Hungarian capital where he is on a four-day visit. A welcoming ceremony at the Lion’s Court of the imposing Buda Castle saw him walk down a red carpet with Orban on Thursday, before the two leaders held talks.\n\nHungary is one of Israel’s strongest European allies and many Hungarians hold a strong pro-Israel sentiment. Stickers and posters commemorating the victims of the October 7 terror attack against Israel are a common sign across Budapest. A Holocaust memorial on the bank of the River Danube just outside the Hungarian Parliament has been adorned with yellow ribbons, signaling the support for the hostages held in Gaza.\n\nHungary’s State Secretary for International Communication and Relations Zoltan Kovacs said the country will begin the withdrawal process on Thursday, “in line with Hungary’s constitutional and international legal obligations.”\n\nThe ICC said it would issue a statement on the announcement later.\n\nIf it goes through with the withdrawal, Hungary will become the only European Union country not to be part of the ICC.\n\nThe bloc has been split in its reaction to the arrest warrants. Some countries, like Ireland and Spain, said they would arrest Netanyahu if he was to visit their territory. Others, including France and Germany, gave a more cautious responses and questioned whether the ICC has jurisdiction over Israel as the country is not a member of the court.\n\nMore than 120 countries have signed up to the Rome Statute, but there are some notable exceptions: the United States, China, Russia and Saudi Arabia are not members.\n\nArrest warrant\n\nWhen the ICC issued the warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant last year, it marked the first time the ICC targeted the top leader of a close ally of the United States. It put Netanyahu in the company of the Russian President Vladimir Putin, for whom the ICC issued an arrest warrant over Moscow’s war on Ukraine, and the Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi, who was facing an arrest warrant from the ICC for alleged crimes against humanity at the time of his capture and killing in October 2011.\n\nThe US – under both the former President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump – criticized the court for issuing the arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant.\n\nTrump went as far as taking steps against the court – imposing economic and travel sanctions on people working on ICC investigations into citizens of the US and its allies.\n\nAt the same time, it also issued warrants for three top leaders of Hamas: its leader in Gaza Yahya Sinwar, the leader of the Al Qassem Brigades, the group’s armed wing Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri, better known as Mohammed Deif, and Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’ political leader. All three have been killed by Israel in the course of the war.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct the month in which the ICC issued arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Galant."

        "full_text": "Emanuel (Mannie) Fabian is The Times of Israel's military correspondent\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces acknowledged on Saturday evening that it had been incorrect in its initial account of an incident in southern Gaza’s Rafah last month during which troops fired on Palestinian emergency vehicles, killing 14 or 15 medics whose bodies were later recovered from a mass grave.\n\nOn Saturday, the army detailed the initial findings from its investigation of the incident, which it said was ongoing. It asserted that at least six of those killed had been posthumously identified as Hamas operatives, denied that any of those killed had been executed, and said troops had not attempted to hide the incident but rather had informed the UN of the location of the grave.\n\nAfter the incident came to light, the military, which accuses Hamas of embedding itself in civilian infrastructure, had initially said the vehicles were without headlights or emergency lights, were uncoordinated, and arrived on the scene shortly after a group of terror operatives. As such, the IDF said soldiers deemed them “suspicious” and opened fire.\n\nOn Saturday, however, The New York Times published a video that appeared to show the emergency vehicles were clearly marked and had their emergency lights on when the IDF opened fire.\n\nUN officials have said that 15 medics were killed by Israeli fire, while the military said that 14 people were killed and one survived.\n\nPalestinians have accused Israeli forces of attempting to cover up the incident by burying the bodies in a mass grave. Claims have also emerged that some of the bodies had their hands tied and were seemingly shot dead from close range.\n\nFollowing the emergence of the video Saturday, the military said that Southern Command chief Maj. Gen. Yaniv Asor would be re-investigating the incident. The complete findings will be presented to IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir on Sunday.\n\nAccording to the military’s findings, the incident began on March 23 amid the resumption of fighting in Gaza, and a new offensive in Rafah’s Tel Sultan neighborhood.\n\nGolani soldiers, who were operating under the 14th Armored Brigade, had set up an ambush on a road in Tel Sultan at around 4 a.m. At that time, the military said, several ambulances and civilians passed by without incident.\n\nAt around 4:30 a.m., a Hamas police vehicle drove through the area, and the Golani soldiers exchanged fire with the operatives inside, killing one and capturing two others, the IDF said. The Hamas vehicle remained on the side of the road.\n\nAt around 6 a.m., a convoy of ambulances arrived in the area, and the IDF soldiers opened fire, perceiving them as a threat. Drone operators flying a UAV overhead had reported to the Golani soldiers that the vehicles were moving toward them in a suspicious manner.\n\nThe initial investigation claimed that the soldiers were surprised by the convoy stopping on the road, next to the abandoned Hamas vehicle, and by several “suspects” jumping out of the convoy and running. The soldiers were said to have been unaware that the suspects were, in fact, unarmed medics.\n\nThe IDF acknowledged that based on the video, its initial statement asserting that the ambulances had had their lights off appeared to be incorrect, noting that it was based on the testimony of soldiers involved in the incident.\n\nThe new IDF investigation is examining that discrepancy.\n\nThe military also said that at least six of the bodies were identified by intelligence officials as Hamas operatives. It was expected to detail the names of the six operatives once the probe was concluded.\n\nThe initial findings rejected claims that the soldiers had intentionally targeted the medics from close range, carried out executions, or tied up the hands of any of the medics.\n\nThe IDF also rejected the assertion that troops had buried the bodies in an unmarked mass grave without informing anyone.\n\nPalestinian Red Crescent chief Dr. Younis Al-Khatib had said on Friday that the aid workers were “targeted from a very close range” and that Israel had “kept us for eight days in the dark” as to the whereabouts of the bodies.\n\nAccording to the military’s initial probe, a deputy battalion commander in Golani and his troops collected the bodies in one spot, covered them with sand, and marked the burial spot.\n\nThe army said that burying bodies in this way was an approved and regular practice during fighting in Gaza, to prevent wild dogs and other animals from eating the corpses.\n\nThe United Nations was promptly notified of the burial spot, the IDF said, and was told to come and collect the bodies. The following day, however, the UN was unable to find the location, and the forces were unavailable to assist as they were busy with another task.\n\nThe UN was then called to return several days later to collect the bodies, and the bodies were eventually recovered in coordination with the IDF, the initial military probe found.\n\nThe UN has said that the mangled ambulances were found buried alongside the bodies. According to the IDF probe, an armored D9 bulldozer pushed the ambulances off the road to open it up, crushing the vehicles in the process.\n\nOfficials from the Palestinian Red Crescent have said that they will submit the video of the attack, filmed on the phone of one of the slain medics, to the UN Security Council.\n\nThe IDF first acknowledged that it had fired on the ambulances and fire engine on March 28, five days after the incident occurred.\n\nThe bodies of the medics, who worked for the Red Crescent, the United Nations, and the Hamas-linked Palestinian Civil Defense, were recovered from the mass grave on April 1.\n\nThe International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said that the incident was the single most deadly attack on Red Cross or Red Crescent workers anywhere since 2017.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, at least 1,060 healthcare workers have been killed in the 18 months since Israel launched its offensive in Gaza in response to Hamas’s October 7 onslaught, during which some 1,200 people were killed, and roughly 250 were taken hostage by terrorists.\n\nThe IDF says that Hamas operatives regularly operate from within medical facilities.\n\nThe incident in the Tel Sultan neighborhood came five days after Israel restarted intense bombing of Gaza on March 18 and then launched a new ground offensive, shattering a nearly two-month ceasefire in the war with Hamas.\n\nAccording to the terms of the January 19 ceasefire deal, the sides were to launch negotiations over the second phase a few weeks into the first, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu refused to do so, insisting that the war would not end until Hamas’s governing and military capabilities had been demolished. Meanwhile, Hamas rejected a series of offers to extend the first phase while continuing to free hostages gradually.\n\nTimes of Israel Staff contributed to this report.\n\nSupporting The Times of Israel isn’t a transaction for an online service, like subscribing to Netflix.

        "full_text": "April 4 (UPI) -- The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Friday announced will allow logging in national forests, which will help spur timber production amid reciprocal tariffs on other nations.\n\nA memo by USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins follows an executive order by President Donald Trump last month to expand timber production.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are 154 national forests covering approximately 188.3 million acres. The most forests are 18 in California.\n\n\"Healthy forests require work, and right now, we're facing a national forest emergency,\" Rollins said in a statement. \"We have an abundance of timber at high risk of wildfires in our National Forest.\n\n\"I am proud to follow the bold leadership of President Trump by empowering forest managers to reduce constraints and minimize the risks of fire, insects, and disease so that we can strengthen American timber industry and further enrich our forests with the resources they need to thrive.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump's order on March 1 directed Rollins and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to issue \"new or updated guidance regarding tools to facilitate increased timber production and sound forest management, reduce time to deliver timber and decrease timber supply uncertainty.\"\n\nThe USDA memo expands U.S. timber production by 25%. It also will \"empower the U.S. Forest Service to expedite work on the ground and carry out authorized emergency actions to reduce wildfire risk and save American lives and communities,\" according to a news release.\n\nTo achieve this, the Forest Service will remove National Environmental Policy Act processes and reduce contracting burdens.\n\nRollins said the rural economies will improve rural economies and avoid wildfire risk.\n\nEnvironmental groups are against the change.\n\n\"This executive order sets in motion a chainsaw free-for-all on our federal forests,\" Blaine Miller-McFeeley, a representative for the group Earthjustice, said in a statement.\n\n\"Americans treasure our forests for all the benefits they provide, such as recreation, clean air, and clean drinking water. But this order ignores these values and opens the door for wild lands to be plundered, for nothing more than corporate gain. In the long run, this will worsen the effects of climate change, while also destroying critical wildlife habitat.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Sierra Club said the order was a giveaway to the logging industry.\n\nThe industry is bracing for an escalating trade war.\n\nThe United States, China, Russia and Canada are the largest producers of wood globally.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service, in 2017, the United States imported about 16.1 billion board feet of lumber from all countries, with Canada supplying nearly 91% of these imports -- or around 14.65 billion board feet of lumber. More recent data indicates that Canada remains the largest supplier of lumber to the U.S.\n\nStarting Saturday, there is a 34% tariff on Chinese products coming into the U.S., including a new one of 34% announced Wednesday.\n\nThere is an exisrting 25% tariff on Canadian exports and the U.S. neighbors to the north retaliated with a 25% one.\n\nThe Trump administration did not place a new tariff on Russia. A White House official told The Hill, they already have extremely high tariffs and sanctions preclude meaningfully trade.\n\nIn 2023, plans for the U.S. Forest Service to plant more than a billion trees by 2030 -- to shade and cool cities, protect water and fight climate change -- are being threatened by seedling scarcity and funding issues, a study by the journal Bioscience found."

        "full_text": "For weeks, US airstrikes have pounded Houthi targets in Yemen, hitting oil refineries, airports and missile sites, with President Trump vowing to use “overwhelming force” until the US achieves its goal of stopping the Houthis from targeting shipping in the Red Sea.\n\nThe Houthis began the campaign in solidarity with Palestinians when Israel went to war in Gaza in October 2023. The group has carried out more than 100 attacks and have sunk two vessels. The result: 70% of merchant shipping that once transited the Red Sea now takes the long route around southern Africa.\n\nThe US says the campaign is working. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said that multiple Houthi leaders had been killed.\n\nBut every round of strikes provokes more defiance.\n\nThe Houthis are what one veteran Yemen-watcher calls the honey badgers of resistance, referring to the belligerent mammal known for its fearless attitude toward predators. Bitten by a cobra, they get up minutes later and attack the snake.\n\nWhile as many as 80 Houthi military officers may have been killed, according to analysts, the senior echelon of its military and political leadership appears intact. So are at least some of its missile-launching sites. Since mid-March, the Houthis have launched a dozen ballistic missiles at Israel, and barrages of drones and missiles at US navy ships. While none caused major damage, the threat remains.\n\nCNN reported on Friday that the total cost of the US military’s operation against the Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen is nearing $1 billion in just under three weeks, according to three people briefed on the campaign, but the attacks had so far had limited impact on destroying the group’s capabilities.\n\n“We are burning through readiness — munitions, fuel, deployment time,” said one official.\n\nFar from being cowed, the Houthis have threatened to extend their range of targets to the UAE, which backs the rival government to the Houthis in Yemen’s Civil War. Similarly, Saudi officials say the Kingdom’s air defenses are on high alert.\n\n“The dozens of airstrikes on Yemen will not deter the Yemeni Armed Forces from fulfilling their religious, moral, and humanitarian duties,” said a Houthi spokesman earlier this week.\n\nThere’s no doubt that the US campaign has degraded the Houthis’ capabilities. Michael Knights, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute, says he suspects the Houthis “have lost a lot of drone manufacturing capability, and there does seem to be more effective interdiction of resupply shipments coming via the sea and via Oman. So the Houthis are not comfortable.”\n\nBut history shows that the Houthis have an extraordinarily high tolerance for pain. And the Trump administration’s determination to eradicate the threat they pose may ultimately require a ground offensive.\n\n“The Houthis are just inured to being at war with a first world military,” Knights says.“They’re ideological, but they’re also very tough tribal fighters from northern Yemen.”\n\nThe Houthis’ ability to survive is helped by an elaborate smuggling network that brings in missile parts and other equipment. Last year, hidden among cargo on one intercepted ship, air frames and fins for artillery rockets, small turbojet engines and hydrogen fuel cells were discovered, according to an investigation by Conflict Armament Research (CAR).\n\nSuch equipment could enable Houthi UAVs to carry larger payloads and to travel for far longer periods. That would “greatly extend the potential threat posed by the Houthis,” CAR reported.\n\nThe Houthis survived several offensives during the long presidency of Ali Abdullah Saleh in Yemen, then a Saudi offensive ten years ago, followed by more recent Israeli, UK and US airstrikes.\n\nAhmed Nagi, a senior analyst on Yemen at the International Crisis Group, says Israel and western powers lack a deep understanding of the Houthis. “Their opaque leadership and internal structure have created persistent gaps in intelligence.”\n\nAnother Yemen expert, Elisabeth Kendall, questions the endgame of the US campaign. “The Houthis have been bombed tens of thousands of times over the past decade and remain undeterred. So one is left thinking that the bombing is largely performative: let’s show the world - we’ll do it because we can.”\n\nCoercing the Houthis, Knights told CNN, is “really, really difficult.”\n\n“They are an extremely aggressive movement. The best way to end them permanently is to overthrow them, remove them from the capital, remove them from the Red Sea coast.”\n\nRegional diplomatic sources, as well as analysts, say that ultimately only a ground offensive can dislodge the Houthis, who currently control the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, its major port, Hodeidah, and much of northern Yemen.\n\nAhmed Nagi, a senior analyst on Yemen at the International Crisis Group, says the US is wrong to believe that airstrikes can compel the Houthis to back down. “This approach failed under the Biden administration and is unlikely to succeed under the Trump administration.”\n\n“Their logic is shaped by years of war; they see resilience as a form of strength and are driven to prove they are not easily deterred.”\n\n“The only times I’ve ever seen the Houthis go to the negotiating table or compromise has been when they’ve been threatened with the realistic prospect of defeat on the ground: territorial loss, loss of control of populations and loss of access to the Red Sea coastline,” said Knights.\n\nThat briefly happened in 2017 when forces backed by the United Arab Emirates threatened Houthi access to the Red Sea, critical for the Houthis’ revenue and military supplies.\n\nThe Houthis, if anything, may actually be relishing US strikes. They are a “direct answer to the Houthi prayers to have a war with the US,” said Farea Al-Muslimi, a Yemeni research fellow at Chatham House. The group “wants to drag the US into a larger regional escalation.”\n\nA ground offensive\n\nThe Houthis are fighting for control of Yemen against the internationally recognized government that controls part of the south and is supported mainly by the UAE. The unanswered question is whether forces loyal to that government can take the fight to the Houthis. “They’re already trained and equipped,” says Knights. But there are doubts about their unity.\n\nAnalysts do not expect the US to put any troops on the ground, beyond a handful of special forces to help direct airstrikes. The US would perhaps provide [Yemeni forces] “with a bit of logistics, certain key munitions,” Knights says.\n\nThe UAE would be “quietly supportive” as it has long supplied the Aden-based government, he adds.\n\nThe Saudi perspective is less clear. Knights believes Riyadh is apprehensive about the Houthis retaliating with long-range drones and missiles against its infrastructure. But the US has accelerated deliveries of anti-missile defenses to Saudi Arabia in recent months.\n\nThe US will have to say to Riyadh: “We are going to protect you in the same way that we protected Israel in 2024 from the two rounds of Iranian strikes,” says Knights.\n\nRegional diplomatic sources say preparations are underway for a ground operation that would be launched from the south and east, as well as along the coast. A coordinated offensive could also involve Saudi and US naval support in an attempt to retake the port of Hodeidah.\n\n“Whether such an operation is feasible remains unclear, as the past decade has shown mixed outcomes, successes in some areas and failures in others,” Nagi told CNN.\n\nThe Iran link\n\nFrom day one, President Trump and other US officials have linked the campaign against the Houthis to Iran. Trump said he would hold Iran responsible for “every shot” fired by Houthi rebels and it would face “dire” consequences for any attacks by the Yemeni militants.\n\nSo far it hasn’t, and it’s unclear whether Tehran can simply order the Houthis to stop firing. While very much part of Iran’s axis of resistance, the Houthis retain considerable autonomy.\n\nTrump continues to warn Iran that it will face a massive bombing campaign if it doesn’t do a deal to limit its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. For the administration, the Houthi campaign and the “maximum pressure” campaign on Tehran are two sides of the same coin.\n\nThe Iranians are treading carefully, offering moral support to their ally in Yemen. Former Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander Mohsen Rezaee hailed “the barefooted resistance forces of Yemen, who will bring advanced American warships to their knees.”\n\nBut the Iranian leadership does not want to be seen providing further military support for the Houthis right now as it tries to work out Trump’s mixture of small carrot and large stick.\n\nThe US appears ready to expand its campaign. B-2 bombers and KC-135 refuelling planes have arrived on the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. That may presage strikes on hardened targets in Yemen but may equally be a signal to Iran.\n\nThe next few weeks may be a crucial test of the honey badgers’ resilience."

        "full_text": "A new survey has found that 80 percent of Americans believe the Trump administration and Congress should prioritize legislation to help people plan and save for a secure retirement.\n\nBlackRock's study, which surveyed 1,000 registered voters between January 11 and January 15, found that only 28 percent believe the United States retirement system gives working Americans the necessary tools and resources to save for a secure later life. Only 18 percent are confident they will have enough money to see out their post-work years, while 51 percent are more worried about running out of money in retirement than dying.\n\nAmerica's retirement landscape has changed significantly over recent years, with many Americans struggling with saving for later in life. A 2023 Pew Research Center report found that around one in five Americans aged 65 and older were still employed in 2023—nearly twice as many as 35 years ago. Rising costs, inflation eating away at purchasing power, and longer life expectancies are all reasons why it is harder to retire now than ever before.\n\n\"Today's workers are struggling to save for retirement. They are traversing disruptions in the economy, a tenuous employment market, and the high cost of everyday living—and many are still regaining their financial footing from the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath,\" the study said.\n\nThe Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act of 2019 and the SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 are laws designed to help more Americans save for retirement. They were part of a more comprehensive spending and tax extension bill that President Donald Trump signed into law on December 20, 2019, during his first term.\n\nThe SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 builds on the original SECURE Act to further enhance retirement savings. It raises the required minimum distribution (RMD) age to 73, allowing more time for tax-deferred growth. The Act also shortens the service requirement for part-time workers to access 401(k) plans, permits Roth employer matching contributions, and introduces penalty-free emergency withdrawals of up to $1,000 annually.\n\nWhile this recent legislation has sought to help Americans bolster their later life savings, experts told Newsweek there are a variety of ways the government could help more.\n\nScott Buffington, vice president and general manager for retirement at Paychex, told Newsweek that with 50 percent of the U.S. workforce employed by small businesses, these employers should be motivated to help their employees with retirement savings.\n\n\"The government should continue to make it easier for small businesses to offer a payroll-deductible retirement plan solution,\" he said. \"Studies have shown that most people do not save for retirement outside of a workplace plan, and most small businesses are still not offering their employees a plan.\"\n\n\"It's critical to motivate small employers to offer something. For example, the Retirement Investment in Small Employers (RISE) Act is a bipartisan legislation that would allow microsized businesses with 1-9 employees to realize full retirement plan startup tax credits and benefits originally offered in SECURE Act 2.0,\" Buffington said. \"This would help these smaller businesses receive incentives similar to those that larger businesses currently receive.\"\n\nCarson McLean, founder of Altruist Wealth Management, said the U.S. should look to other countries to help Americans catch up before retirement.\n\n\"Australia mandates employee retirement contributions with opt-out flexibility. This small behavioral shift—making saving the default—has had a profound effect,\" he said. \"Australians now hold over $150,000 AUD per capita in retirement savings.\"\n\nThe median retirement saving held in America is $38,176, according to Vanguard Asset Management.\n\n\"When pensions gave way to 401(k)s, we shifted a complex burden onto individual workers,\" McLean said. \"Many never enroll. Others under-contribute or remain in low-growth options for years. Auto-enrollment and default investments have helped, but they only matter if people are actually contributing.\"\n\n\"If we want to improve retirement security in America, we need systems that guide people toward success while still preserving personal choice,\" McLean said."

        "full_text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A crackdown on foreign students is alarming college leaders, who say the Trump administration is using new tactics and vague justifications to push some students out of the country.\n\nCollege officials worry the new approach will keep foreigners from wanting to study in the U.S.\n\nStudents stripped of their entry visas are receiving orders from the Department of Homeland Security to leave the country immediately — a break from past practice that often permitted them to stay and complete their studies.\n\nSome students have been targeted over pro-Palestinian activism or criminal infractions — or even traffic violations. Others have been left wondering how they ran afoul of the government.\n\nAt Minnesota State University in Mankato, President Edward Inch told the campus Wednesday that visas had been revoked for five international students for unclear reasons.\n\nHe said school officials learned about the revocations when they ran a status check in a database of international students after the detention of a Turkish student at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. The State Department said the detention was related to a drunken driving conviction.\n\n“These are troubling times, and this situation is unlike any we have navigated before,” Inch wrote in a letter to campus.\n\nPresident Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to deport foreign students involved in pro-Palestinian protests, and federal agents started by detaining Columbia graduate student Mahmoud Khalil, a green-card-holder and Palestinian activist who was prominent in protests at Columbia last year. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week students are being targeted for involvement in protests along with others tied to “potential criminal activity.”\n\nIn the past two weeks, the government apparently has widened its crackdown. Officials from colleges around the country have discovered international students have had their entry visas revoked and, in many cases, their legal residency status terminated by authorities without notice — including students at Arizona State, Cornell, North Carolina State, the University of Oregon, the University of Texas and the University of Colorado.\n\nSome of the students are working to leave the country on their own, but students at Tufts and the University of Alabama have been detained by immigration authorities — in the Tufts case, even before the university knew the student’s legal status had changed.\n\nFeds bypass colleges to move against students\n\nIn this new wave of enforcement, school officials say the federal government is quietly deleting foreigners’ student records instead of going through colleges, as was done in the past.\n\nStudents are being ordered to leave the country with a suddenness that universities have rarely seen, said Miriam Feldblum, president and CEO of the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration.\n\nIn the past, when international students have had entry visas revoked, they generally have been allowed to keep legal residency status. They could stay in the country to study, but would need to renew their visa if they left the U.S. and wanted to return. Now, increasing numbers of students are having their legal status terminated, exposing them to the risk of being arrested.\n\n“None of this is regular practice,” Feldblum said.\n\nAt North Carolina State University, two students from Saudi Arabia left the U.S. after learning their legal status as students was terminated, the university said. N.C. State said it will work with the students to complete their semester from outside the country.\n\nPhilip Vasto, who lived with one of the students, said his roommate, in graduate school for engineering management, was apolitical and did not attend protests against the war in Gaza. When the government told his roommate his student status had been terminated, it did not give a reason, Vasto said.\n\nSince returning to Saudi Arabia, Vasto said his former roommate’s top concern is getting into another university.\n\n“He’s made his peace with it,” he said. “He doesn’t want to allow it to steal his peace any further.”\n\nDatabase checks turn up students in jeopardy\n\nAt the University of Texas at Austin, staff checking a federal database discovered two people on student visas had their permission to be in the U.S. terminated, a person familiar with the situation said. The person declined to be identified for fear of retaliation.\n\nOne of the people, from India, had their legal status terminated April 3. The federal system indicated the person had been identified in a criminal records check “and/or has had their visa revoked.” The other person, from Lebanon, had their legal status terminated March 28 due to a criminal records check, according to the federal database.\n\nBoth people were graduates remaining in the U.S. on student visas, using an option allowing people to gain professional experience after completing coursework. Both were employed full time and apparently had not violated requirements for pursuing work experience, the person familiar with the situation said.\n\nSome students have had visas revoked by the State Department under an obscure law barring noncitizens whose presence could have “serious adverse foreign policy consequences.” Trump invoked the law in a January order demanding action against campus antisemitism.\n\nBut some students targeted in recent weeks have had no clear link to political activism. Some have been ordered to leave over misdemeanor crimes or traffic infractions, Feldblum said. In some cases, students were targeted for infractions that had been previously reported to the government.\n\nSome of the alleged infractions would not have drawn scrutiny in the past and will likely be a test of students’ First Amendment rights as cases work their way through court, said Michelle Mittelstadt, director of public affairs at the Migration Policy Institute.\n\n“In some ways, what the administration is doing is really retroactive,” she said.\n\nThe Association of Public and Land-grant Universities is requesting a meeting with the State Department over the issue. It’s unclear whether more visas are being revoked than usual, but officials fear a chilling effect on international exchange.\n\nMany of the association’s members have recently seen at least one student have their visa revoked, said Bernie Burrola, a vice president at the group. With little information from the government, colleges have been interviewing students or searching social media for a connection to political activism.\n\n“The universities can’t seem to find anything that seems to be related to Gaza or social media posts or protests,” Burrola said. “Some of these are sponsored students by foreign governments, where they specifically are very hesitant to get involved in protests.”\n\nThere’s no clear thread indicating which students are being targeted, but some have been from the Middle East and China, he said.\n\nAt Texas A&M, officials who looked into why three students had their status terminated said they had long-resolved offenses on their records, including one with a speeding ticket.\n\nAmerica’s universities have long been seen as a top destination for the world’s brightest minds — and they’ve brought important tuition revenue and research breakthroughs to U.S. colleges. But international students also have other options, said Fanta Aw, CEO of NAFSA, an association of international educators.\n\n“We should not take for granted that that’s just the way things are and will always be,” she said.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

        "full_text": "As U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg continues to be a thorn in the side of the Trump administration’s effort to deport gangbangers, legal experts have begun to raise questions about his handling of the case.\n\nThe Obama-appointed judge in March blocked President Donald Trump from using wartime authorities to send suspected Tren de Aragua gangbangers to a mega-prison in El Salvador, prompting incredible pushback from the president himself. As the challenge to the deportations play out in court, some legal experts have argued Boasberg should recuse himself from the case entirely, while others say he appears to be “making policy from the bench.” (RELATED: ‘The Border Is Closed’: Trump Admin Claims Historic Low In Migrant Crossings)\n\nCritics have pointed to the fact that Boasberg’s daughter, Katharine Boasberg, works for an organization whose founder openly celebrated her father’s decision to halt the deportations.\n\n“Under Canon 3 (C) (1) of the ‘Code of Conduct for United States Judges’ it states that judges must disqualify themselves from a case ‘in which the judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned,'” Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation, said to the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Given that his daughter works directly for an organization that supports illegal aliens, opposes deportation of aliens, and has voiced its support for Boasberg’s action in this very case, the impartiality of his judgment is obviously open to be reasonably questioned.”\n\n“He should have recused himself given his immediate family’s involvement in advocacy for illegal immigration,” Spakovsky continued.\n\nThe debate began on March 15, when Trump officially invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a seldom-used wartime authority, to expeditiously arrest and deport Tren de Aragua gang members. Boasberg quickly issued a temporary block on the flights and ordered any deportation flights in the air to turn around. However, three planes carrying 238 suspected and confirmed Tren de Aragua gangbangers and 23 MS-13 gang members managed to land at the El Salvador International airport.\n\nThe Trump administration immediately ripped Boasberg for the decision.\n\n“Tonight, a DC trial judge supported Tren de Aragua terrorists over the safety of Americans,” Attorney General Pam Bondi stated after Boasberg’s order. “This order disregards well-established authority regarding President Trump’s power, and it puts the public and law enforcement at risk.”\n\nIn a court filing the following Monday, the Justice Department appealed the order and called for Boasberg to be reassigned. The administration further ripped the judge for “highly unusual and improper procedures” and accused the court of a “hasty public inquiry” into sensitive national security matters involving a criminal syndicate.\n\n“If a President doesn’t have the right to throw murderers, and other criminals, out of our Country because a Radical Left Lunatic Judge wants to assume the role of President, then our Country is in very big trouble, and destined to fail!” Trump posted on Truth Social.\n\nQuestions over possible conflicts of interest arose after Boasberg’s family connections to a liberal organization surfaced. His daughter, Katherine, works for Partners in Justice, a nonprofit group based in New York City that provides client advocates to public defenders.\n\nThe group removed her biography from its website after Boasberg was assigned to the Alien Enemies Act case, according to the New York Post, but an archive of the page was saved. Before landing at Partners for Justice, Katherine worked at the Center for Justice Innovation, a left-wing organization that advocates for “racial justice” in the court system.\n\nEmily Galvin-Almanza, the founder and executive director of Partners in Justice, said Boasberg’s decision to block the wartime deportations was done “rightly” and she previously took to social media to rip the Laken Riley Act, a law mandating federal immigration authorities detain illegal migrants who commit theft-related crimes.\n\nThe Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges makes clear that judges must recuse themselves from a case “in which the judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned,” including instances when a child of a judge is “known by the judge to have an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding.”\n\nHowever, there is debate over whether Boasberg fits this description.\n\n“Generally the employment of an adult child of a judge does not mandate recusal, even if the adult child is employed by a law firm representing a party in the case,” Richard Painter, a law professor for the University of Minnesota, said to the DCNF. “However, if the adult child is at all involved in the representation of a party, recusal of the judge is generally required.”\n\n“Although nonprofits that don’t provide legal representation do not represent parties, I would apply the same rule,” Painter continued. “The involvement of an adult child’s employee in a matter is not sufficient grounds for recusal, but the involvement of the adult child herself is.”\n\nAppointed to the bench by President Barack Obama in 2011, Boasberg has since presided over a number of high-profile court cases over the years, including those involving the Trump administration. In addition to the Alien Enemies Act case, the 62-year-old judge is also ruling over a lawsuit challenging top government officials’ use of Signal to discuss sensitive military operations in Yemen.\n\nBoasberg ripped the administration for allowing the deportation flights on March 15 to continue on to their destination in El Salvador, ostensibly in defiance of his order, and has demanded the DOJ answer a litany of questions regarding the flights. The administration has pointed out the judge’s written order didn’t get released until after the flights were already over international waters.\n\nWhile hesitant to declare whether Boasberg has any conflicts of interest in the deportation case, Matt O’Brien, a former immigration judge, questioned the immense scope of his ruling.\n\n“The real problem with Judge Boasberg’s ruling isn’t any kind of bias. Rather, it is that, in this particular case, he rendered a decision which appears to have been intended to effectuate a specific policy outcome,” O’Brien, who now serves as Director of Investigations for the Immigration Reform Law Institute, said to the DCNF.\n\n“However, his job isn’t to create policy – that duty belongs to the Executive Branch and Congress,” he said. “Instead, Judge Boasberg was charged with applying the relevant law to the facts of the case. Rather than doing his job he engaged in judicial activism (making policy from the bench).”\n\nSimilar to O’Brien, the administration and other Republicans have voiced consternation over the level of authority a single district court judge is able to wield over an entire administrative branch of government.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, a top ally of the president, introduced legislation in March that calls for limiting federal court orders to parties directly before the court. If passed and signed into law, such a move would essentially squash universal injunctions and rein in the scope of judicial activism. (RELATED: Congress Has The Tools To Stop Rogue Judges From Overriding Trump’s Agenda — Without Reaching For Impeachment)\n\nThe desire to see such reforms in the judiciary appears to be quite high within the GOP. Grassley’s bill, which was very recently introduced, already touts more than 20 co-sponsors in the upper chamber.\n\n“And by engaging in such behavior, Judge Boasberg intruded upon powers that the Constitution and the Immigration and Nationality Act very clearly assigned to the Executive Branch,” O’Brien said. “That upends our system of checks and balances and throws the whole machinery of government off kilter.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.\n\nNow that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate media and joining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes to marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; senators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want to limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our independence.\n\nWe don't complain -- we can't stand complainers -- but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our hands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.\n\nWe're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates them -- because we won’t bend the knee to political correctness.\n\nOne reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of our being, and we think she's worth saving from today’s craziness.\n\nHelp us save her.\n\nA second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train. We have trained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political spectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There’s a good chance they were trained at Daily Caller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, Newsmax, Daily Wire and many others.\n\nSimply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a fair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.\n\nSince 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. And we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible to ignore.\n\nWe can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can’t do it unless you — the everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment — have our back.\n\nPlease consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, corporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new generation of news reporters who will actually tell the truth. And help us remind Americans everywhere that there are millions of us who remain clear-eyed about our country's greatness.\n\nIn return for membership, Daily Caller Patriots will be able to read The Daily Caller without any of the ads that we have long used to support our mission. We know the ads drive you crazy. They drive us crazy too. But we need revenue to keep the fight going. If you join us, we will cut out the ads for you and put every Lincoln-headed cent we earn into amplifying our voice, training even more solid reporters, and giving you the ad-free experience and lightning fast website you deserve.\n\nPatriots will also be eligible for Patriots Only content, newsletters, chats and live events with our reporters and editors. It's simple: welcome us into your lives, and we'll welcome you into ours.\n\nWe can save America together.\n\nBecome a Daily Caller Patriot today.\n\nNeil Patel"

        "full_text": "LOS FRESNOS, Texas (AP) — Leonardo Baez and Nora Avila-Guel’s bakery in the Texas community of Los Fresnos is a daily stop for many residents to share gossip over coffee and pick up cakes and pastries for birthdays, office parties or themselves.\n\nWhen Homeland Security Investigations agents showed up at Abby’s Bakery in February and arrested the owners and eight employees, residents of Los Fresnos were shocked.\n\nBut the bakery’s owners, Baez and Avila-Guel, a Mexican couple who are legal U.S. permanent residents, could lose everything after being accused of concealing and harboring immigrants who were in the U.S. illegally. It’s a rare case in which business owners face criminal charges rather than just a fine.\n\n“I was surprised because I know that they’re not taking advantage of the people,” Esteban Rodriguez, 43, said after pulling into the bakery’s parking lot to discover it was closed. “It was more like helping out people. They didn’t have nowhere to go, instead of them being on the streets.”\n\nThe reaction in the town of 8,500 residents may show the limits of support for President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown in a majority Hispanic region dotted with fields of cotton, sugarcane and red grapefruit where Republicans made gains in last year’s elections. Cameron County voted for a GOP president for the first time since 2004. For neighboring Starr County, it was the first time since 1896.\n\nLos Fresnos, which is 90% Latino and counts the school district as its largest employer, is about a half-hour drive from the U.S.-Mexico border. Hundreds of school bus drivers, painters, retirees and parishioners from the nearby Catholic church come into Abby’s Bakery each day. Customers with silver trays and tongs select pastries from glass-door cabinets.\n\nThe owners had green cards but employees did not\n\nSix of Abby’s eight employees were in the U.S. on visitor visas but none had work permits when Homeland Security Investigations agents came to the business Feb. 12. The owners acknowledged they knew that, according to a federal complaint.\n\nEmployees lived in a room with six beds and shared two bathrooms in the same building as the bakery, according to an agent’s affidavit.\n\nBaez, 55, and Avila-Guel, 46, have pleaded not guilty. They referred questions to their attorneys, who noted the workers were not held against their will and there was no attempt to hide their presence, as a smuggler would.\n\nAs green card holders, the couple could be deported if they are convicted. They have five children who are U.S. citizens.\n\nThe bakery closed for several days after their arrest, drawing about 20 people to protest on an uncharacteristically chilly evening.\n\nMonsignor Pedro Briseño of St. Cecilia Church often visited before early morning Mass for the campechana, a flaky, crunchy pastry dough layered with caramelized sugar. His routine was interrupted when plainclothes immigration agents arrived in unmarked vehicles.\n\n“A woman came here crying. She said, ‘Father, Father, they’re taking my brother,’” Briseño said. The priest walked over and saw agents use zip ties to bind employees’ hands.\n\nSupport for deportations has limits\n\nThere is overwhelming bipartisan support to deport people who are in the U.S. illegally and have been convicted of a violent crime, with 82% in favor, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll in January. Support softens considerably for deportations of all people in the country illegally, with 43% in favor and 37% opposed.\n\nTrump and top aides repeatedly emphasize they are deporting criminals. But, as border czar Tom Homan often says, others in the country illegally who are there when officers arrest criminals also will be deported, a departure from the Biden administration’s practices.\n\nSo far, Trump has avoided the large-scale factory and office raids that characterized his first term and that of Republican President George W. Bush. Scattered reports of smaller operations included the recent arrests of 37 people at a roofing business in northern Washington state.\n\nICE says it made 32,809 arrests in Trump’s first 50 days in office, or a daily average of 656, which compared with a daily average of 311 during a 12-month period ending Sept. 30. ICE said nearly half (14,111) were convicted criminals and nearly one-third (9,980) had pending criminal charges but did not specify the charges.\n\nPeople with deep ties in their communities and no criminal records tend to generate more sympathy.\n\nThe bakery is a Los Fresnos staple\n\nAbby’s reopened after the owners were released on bond.\n\nChela and Alicia Vega, two sisters in their 60s who retired from the school district and have known the bakery owners for years, were among the customers filling trays with pastries. Chela Vega said the couple once took a week off from work to drive them to San Luis Potosi in Mexico after their sister died. When a hurricane struck, Leonardo Baez cut down their damaged trees without charge.\n\nFor Terri Sponsler, 61, shopping at Abby’s is now a political statement. “With everything going on right now in our country, we need to find ways to protest,” she said.\n\nMark W. Milum, the city manager, said Abby’s is an important business that contributes property and sales tax revenue to the $13 million annual municipal budget.\n\nSome customers just love the products.\n\n“Other bakeries, they pop up, right?” said Ruth Zamora, 65. “But when you go there, it’s not the same.”"

        "full_text": "President Donald Trump has been laying siege to Columbia University, canceling $400 million in federal grants to the elite school. In exchange for having funds restored, Columbia's administration has agreed to capitulate to a list of demands relating to campus anti-Israel demonstrations: The university will ban protesters from concealing their identities with face masks, create new disciplinary bureaucracies to punish purportedly disruptive students, and even police the Middle Eastern studies department for alleged antisemitism.\n\nIt's not inherently wrong for the federal government to refrain from funding an extremely wealthy private institution of higher education, especially one with an endowment of $14.8 billion. But the Trump administration isn't trying to save money for taxpayers—it's using the money as leverage to make the university police student expression.\n\nWhile some of the protesters at Columbia illegally occupied buildings, prevented other students from attending classes, or otherwise impeded legitimate school functions in violation of campus policy, the heavy-handed measures being imposed on the university will almost certainly lead to a crackdown on nonviolent speech. Some protesters are already facing severe sanction and even deportation. There is no question that the threat of losing funds will compel Columbia's administrators to police anti-Israel expression in a manner that is careless and inconsistent with the campus's stated commitment to academic freedom.\n\nTo the extent that the Trump administration's actions have motivated this change in policy, they are drawing criticism from civil libertarians. Jonathan Zimmerman, an historian of education at the University of Pennsylvania, told The Guardian that Trump's attack on Columbia is already having a chilling effect and that he has never seen anything like it before.\n\n\"Historically, there is no precedent for this,\" said Zimmerman. \"The government is using the money as a cudgel to micromanage a university.\"\n\nZimmerman's concerns about free speech are well-founded. But he is flatly incorrect to state that this has never happened before. Trump is following the exact precedent set by his two predecessors—Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama.\n\nIndeed, the Biden and Obama administrations did not merely use \"money as a cudgel to micromanage a university.\" They used money as a cudgel to micromanage every university in the country.\n\nThis was done, beginning in 2011, under the auspices of Title IX, the federal statute that prohibits sex-based discrimination in education. Under Obama, the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) re-interpreted Title IX to require all universities that receive public funding to police sexual misconduct on campuses in a manner that violated both due process and free speech principles. These requirements were panned by organizations that work to defend such principles, including the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE). FIRE's president, Greg Lukianoff, accused the federal government of forcing universities to \"investigate harassment claims even when a reasonable person would not have found the speech objectionable, thereby weaponizing the sensitivities of the least speech-tolerant students of campus.\"\n\nAdministrators were told to take swift action against \"any unwanted conduct of a sexual nature,\" which in practice meant that students and professors faced disciplinary measures for speaking out on such subjects. One of the most iconic and well-publicized instance of this Title IX–driven censorship was the persecution of Northwestern University professor Laura Kipnis. Kipnis wrote an essay in 2015 that defended a colleague who had been accused of violating Title IX and that decried the atmosphere of paranoia that had taken hold at Northwestern. In response, she was herself accused of violating Title IX and subjected to a Kafkaesque disciplinary proceeding. As I wrote at the time:\n\nKipnis was informed that the charges existed—not what they were—via email. Norwthwestern's Title IX coordinator explained that the university would hire an outside law firm to investigate the complaints. Kipnis was not entitled to a lawyer—though she could bring a silent \"support person\"—and wouldn't be notified of the actual charges until she sat down with the investigators: either in person or via Skype. The investigators, who worked out of state, would be flown in to deal with her.\n\nAll of this occurred because a professor expressed her opinion on a matter of consequence and her critics weaponized the system to try and silence her. And Kipnis's ordeal was not unique whatsoever: Countless students and professors endured similar Kafkaesque trials.\n\nThese farcical persecutions were done at the behest of the Obama administration, in accordance with a strained legal view that federal discrimination law obliged universities to police sex-related speech. When Trump came to power in 2016, his Education Department rescinded the guidance to the universities; four years later, the Biden administration largely restored it.\n\nThe potential loss of federal funding is exactly what motivated virtually every college and university in the country that ran afoul of the OCR to fall in line and police students and professors in a manner that violated their free speech and due process rights. Virtually no university presidents stood up to the Obama and Biden administrations in the face of these threats. No elite campus behaved bravely. Not a single member of the Ivy League decided, at the administrative level, to fight back.\n\n\"People may have forgotten that the Obama and Biden administrations also 'weaponized' federal research funding by threatening to withhold funds from institutions they deemed to be out of compliance with their mandates,\" wrote Kipnis a recent post on Facebook. \"Universities were bending over for federal funds long before Trump, spending untold billions to stay on the right side of the OCR bureaucracy.\"\n\nThe Trump administration is now using antisemitic discrimination as a pretext to police campus speech, just as the previous Democratic administrations used gender-based discrimination as their pretext. It's the same bad playbook, and universities are giving it the same bad reaction: total surrender."

        "full_text": "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made a show on Facebook of his meeting with American Indian and Alaska Native leaders last month, declaring himself “very inspired” and committed to improving the Indian Health Service, which he says has “always been treated as the redheaded stepchild” by his agency.\n\nNow Native leaders have some questions for him.\n\nWhy, they would like to know, did he lay off employees in programs aimed at supporting Native people, like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Healthy Tribes initiative? Why has he shuttered five regional offices of the Department of Health and Human Services that, by the estimate of one advocate for tribes, cover 80 percent of the nation’s Indian population?\n\nWhy were five senior advisers for tribal issues within the department’s Administration for Children and Families, all of them Indian or Native people, let go? Why are all of these changes being made without consulting tribal leaders, despite centuries-old treaty obligations, as well as presidential executive orders, requiring it?\n\nBut the final indignity, Native leaders say, came last week, when Mr. Kennedy reassigned high-ranking health officials — including a bioethicist married to Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, a tobacco regulator, a human resources manager and others — to Indian Health Service locations in the American West, when what the chronically understaffed service really needs are doctors and nurses who are familiar with the unique needs of Native people.\n\n“They are breaching their trust obligation to Indian tribes by all of the scams that they’re doing,” said Deb Haaland, the former interior secretary and congresswoman, who is a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe and a Democratic candidate for governor of New Mexico. “It’s terrible, it’s shameful and it isn’t right.”\n\nThis week, Mr. Kennedy will visit Native health providers and meet with tribal leaders in Arizona and New Mexico to spotlight his commitment to Indian health. The secretary, who has also been invited to appear before the Senate health committee to testify about the job cuts and the vast reorganization of his department, has spoken often of his and his family’s longstanding commitment to Native Americans. The Coalition of Large Tribes, an advocacy group, gave his nomination its highest endorsement.\n\n“I spent 20 percent of my career working on Native issues,” Mr. Kennedy told Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, during his confirmation hearings in January, adding that his father and his uncle, former Senator Edward M. Kennedy, “were deeply, deeply critical of the functioning of the Indian Health Service back in 1968 and 1980, and nothing’s changed.”\n\nHe vowed that if confirmed, he would bring in a Native person as an assistant secretary “to make sure that all of the decisions that we make in our agency are conscious of their impacts on First Nations.” The department has a Secretary’s Tribal Advisory Committee, which met with Mr. Kennedy last month.\n\nThe Indian Health Service, a network of hospitals, clinics and health centers, some operated by tribes themselves, flows from a series of treaties and court rulings that obligate the federal government to provide health care to American Indian and Native people — an obligation that can be traced back to 1787, when the Constitution recognized “Indian tribes” as sovereign nations. The people it serves have profound health challenges.\n\nNative Americans have long had shorter life expectancy and higher rates of disease than other ethnic groups. According to an analysis published last year by the National Council of Urban Indian Health, white people born in 2021 are expected to live an average of 11 years longer than their American Indian and Alaska Native peers. Native Americans die disproportionately from chronic liver disease, diabetes, homicide, and suicide, according to the Indian Health Service.\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Kennedy noted that the service itself had not been affected by the recent layoffs, and said there were no plans to consolidate any of its offices. (One tribal leader, Aaron Payment of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, said that was not true; Indian Health Service workers in his area were told to cancel their lease on a local office, he said, and didn’t know where they would go.)\n\nThe spokesman said the proposed transfers were voluntary, although legal experts said those who refused would be subject to termination without severance pay. The spokesman would not say how many employees were affected.\n\nBut in interviews, more than half a dozen leaders of Native American groups used words like “cruel,” “disingenuous” and “offensive” to describe the proposed transfers. Cruel because the administration gave workers one day to decide whether to uproot their families in order to keep their jobs; disingenuous because the moves seemed aimed at getting rid of high-performing employees who might otherwise be difficult to lay off; and offensive because they play into the racist trope that the regions served by the program constitute a backwater.\n\nSome chose their words carefully, fearing that if they angered Mr. Kennedy or President Trump, it would make things worse for the people they represent. A.C. Locklear, who runs the National Indian Health Board, a nonprofit representing the nation’s 574 tribes, was asked whether he viewed the recent job transfers as a serious effort to improve the health of Native Americans.\n\nMr. Locklear, an attorney and citizen of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, was silent for a long while. “I’m not exactly sure how to answer that,” he finally said.\n\nLegal experts say the transfers are permissible under the law. Those affected hold positions within the senior executive service, a corps of high-ranking government employees created by Congress in 1979 to give agency heads more flexibility in transferring people with executive skills.\n\nTwo employees who got transfer notices said they had been placed on administrative leave and cut off from their work email accounts. One said she would consider a reassignment, despite the hardship for her family. Another said she had turned the offer down. Both spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. Dr. Fauci’s wife, Christine Grady, declined to be interviewed.\n\nDavid Simmons, the government affairs and advocacy director for the National Indian Child Welfare Association, a nonprofit in Portland, Ore., said it looked to him as though the administration was waging pressure campaigns to push senior leaders who are not familiar with Indian tribes into jobs for which they are not suited.\n\n“That’s a huge waste of time, and it’s an ineffective and inefficient way to get business done,” he said.\n\nHe also said his group had worked for years with the health department to put together a team of five advisers for Native issues within the Administration for Children and Families, a sub-agency of the health department. He learned that all five had been laid off as part of last week’s “reduction in force” that eliminated 10,000 employees.\n\n“It’s an incredible loss,” Mr. Simmons said.\n\nTribal leaders have long labored to be treated as equals by American politicians. But, they say, never have they struggled as much as under Mr. Trump.\n\nEven before Mr. Kennedy was confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Trump’s assault on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives infuriated Native Americans, who felt forced to explain that programs that serve them should not be eliminated. “We’re not racial minorities; we are political minorities,” Mr. Simmons said.\n\nBut while Native leaders expected such moves from Mr. Trump, many say they feel betrayed by Mr. Kennedy. As an independent presidential candidate, he visited with the Coalition of Large Tribes and spoke of his family trips to the Rosebud Sioux Indian Reservation, the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and Hopi and Navajo reservations while he was a child, according to Last Real Indians, a news organization that covered the event.\n\n“This was very much a part of my youth,” he was quoted as saying, adding that his father, who was killed in 1968 while running for president, “believed the treatment of Indigenous people in this country — the Native Americans, the ones who above all others can call themselves American — that that was the original sin of our country.”\n\nMr. Payment, who served on the Secretary’s Tribal Advisory Committee under three presidents, including during the first Trump administration, said in an interview that he believes Mr. Kennedy is genuine. He blamed Elon Musk, who is leading an effort to overhaul the government. He wrote on LinkedIn that while Mr. Kennedy “cleans up good for his new role and had a collegial interaction” with the committee, “major cuts are happening right under our noses with his consent.”"

But sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\"\n\nIn a series of TV interviews earlier on Sunday, Trump's top officials also played down recent stock market falls.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent told NBC's Meet the Press programme that there was \"no reason\" to expect a recession as a result. \"This is an adjustment process,\" he added.\n\nBessent also argued that Trump had \"created maximum leverage for himself, and more than 50 countries have approached the administration about lowering their non-tariff trade barriers, lowering their tariffs, stopping currency manipulation\".\n\nMeanwhile, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CBS News that the 10% \"baseline\" tariff on all imports, which came into effect a day earlier, will definitely \"stay in place for days and weeks\".\n\nLutnick went on say the steeper reciprocal tariffs were still on track.\n\nHigher custom tariffs on roughly 60 countries, dubbed the \"worst offenders\", are due to come into effect on Wednesday 9 April.\n\nWhen asked about these tariffs, Lutnick said they were coming. \"[Trump] announced it and he wasn't kidding,\" he said.\n\nLutnick also defended tariffs imposed on two tiny Antarctic islands populated only by penguins, saying it was to close \"loopholes\" for countries such as China to \"ship through\".\n\nElsewhere, Indonesia and Taiwan have said over the weekend that they will not impose retaliatory tariffs after the US announced a 32% levy on imports from both countries.\n\nVietnam's leader, To Lam, has asked Trump to delay a 46% duty on Vietnamese exports to the US by \"at least 45 days\", according to a letter seen by news agency AFP and the New York Times.\n\nHowever, China announced on Friday that it will impose a 34% tariff on all US imports, beginning on Thursday 10 April."

        "full_text": "With new wide-ranging and aggressive tariffs from the Trump administration and the possibility of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) expiring at the end of the year, average Americans could face a hefty price tag.\n\n\"If the tax cuts expire, the median family would lose about $1,000,\" nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) Kimberly Clausing told Fox News Digital, citing a model from the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.\n\nAnd if the recently unveiled tariffs continue, \"that would generate an average per household consumer loss of $3,800,\" she added, pointing to the Yale Budget Lab's estimate.\n\nThis, she said, would be \"far more damaging to Americans' pocketbooks than the tax cut expiration.\"\n\nREPUBLICANS CHARGE AHEAD ON TRUMP BUDGET, SETTING UP MARATHON SENATE VOTES\n\n\"Tariffs are also more damaging to the efficiency of our economy as well as our relations with allies and partners abroad,\" Clausing continued.\n\nIt comes as House and Senate Republicans navigate their slim majorities in Congress to pass a massive bill advancing President Donald Trump's agenda by the end of this year, via the budget reconciliation process. GOP leaders hope to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts in the legislation, in addition to policy overhauls on energy and border security.\n\nOn April 2, dubbed \"Liberation Day\" by Trump, he announced a baseline duty of 10% on all imports to the U.S., with customized tariffs set for countries with higher tariffs in place on American goods. The 10% tariffs began on Saturday, and others will start on April 9.\n\nSome examples of the customized tariffs assigned to specific countries are 34% (not including previous 20% tariffs) on China, 20% on the European Union, 25% on South Korea and 26% on India, among many others.\n\nTED CRUZ CLASHES WITH KEY DEMOCRAT OVER 'SECOND PHASE OF LAWFARE' THROUGH FEDERAL JUDGES' ORDERS\n\nClaude Barfield, a former consultant to the office of the U.S. trade representative and senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, discussed the tariffs with Fox News Digital, explaining, \"Some people think that certainly it will raise prices in some areas, but there's a difference in raising prices and having a full inflationary effect.\"\n\n\"That doesn't mean… that you won't notice it or a consumer won't notice,\" he added.\n\nTax Foundation's Garrett Watson said one big risk of the new tariffs is that they could offset \"much or all the benefits of extending the expiring TCJA provisions.\"\n\n\"In our October 2024 analysis, for example, a hypothetical set of tariffs of a similar size as the combined tariffs enacted so far nearly wiped out the benefits of the tax cut extensions,\" he explained.\n\nGOP DEFECTORS HELP SENATE ADVANCE RESOLUTION TO CANCEL TRUMP TARIFFS DESPITE WHITE HOUSE VETO WARNING\n\nThe GOP-led House Committee on Ways and Means released a memo in recent months arguing that average taxpayers would pay 22% more if the 2017 tax cuts were left to expire. \"A family of four making $80,610, the median income in the United States, would see a $1,695 tax increase if the Trump tax cuts expire,\" the committee release said.\n\n\"This is worth about nine weeks of groceries to a typical family of four across the country,\" it added.\n\nDaniel Bunn of the Tax Foundation said, \"In short, families across the country will continue to face higher costs if lawmakers in Washington don’t focus their efforts on pro-growth and fiscally responsible economic policies.\"\n\nBoth House and Senate Republican leaders have emphasized that they do not want to let Trump's tax cuts expire, and are so far optimistic that they will not.\n\nSCOOP: LINDSEY GRAHAM AMENDMENT SIGNALS GOP BUDGET BREAKTHROUGH, SETS STAGE FOR TRUMP AGENDA\n\nThe effect their expiration would have on Americans was emphasized, however, by President of Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) Grover Norquist in an interview with Fox News Digital.\n\n\"It'd be a real shock per family, per person to see in real life, times thousands of dollars,\" he said.\n\nBut what's more is that the expired cuts, effectively an increase in taxes, \"would transfer hundreds of billions that was flowing into corporate investment and jobs and new investment, and that would go straight to the government instead,\" he explained.\n\nNorquist expressed confidence in congressional Republicans' ability to get the tax cuts extended, however. \"I believe we are close,\" he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I think it is as certain as anything is in the world in politics. It is extremely likely that we're all set.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and the White House did not provide comment to Fox News Digital in time for publication."

        "full_text": "As Donald Trump and Elon Musk widen their radical attacks on US judges who have stalled some of Trump’s executive orders and Musk’s slashing of federal agencies, they’re gaining backing from top House Republicans and other politicians, including some to whom the tech billionaire made big campaign donations.\n\nThe House speaker, Mike Johnson, and judiciary panel chairman Jim Jordan have echoed some of Trump’s attacks on judges, and a judiciary subcommittee hearing on 1 April explored “judicial overreach” and ways to curb judges who have stymied some Trump orders or Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) and its draconian cuts to the federal government.\n\nVeteran Republican consultants say the hefty campaign-spending muscle of Musk, the world’s richest person, who spent about $300m helping Trump win last year, is likely to boost many Republican candidates in 2026 races, increasing pressures on members from Trump and Musk to accelerate efforts to rein in dissident judges.\n\n“Republicans on Capitol Hill expect Musk to make a lot of donations to them in 2026,” said longtime Republican consultant Charlie Black. “But it’s likely that such donations will be coordinated with the president’s preferences.”\n\nThe verbal assaults on judges by Trump and his allies have been fueled by multiple rulings adverse to some Trump executive orders, including major court decisions in March that sought to halt deporting Venezuelan immigrants and blocking penalizing law firms that Trump deemed political enemies.\n\nWashington DC judge James Boasberg incurred Trump’s wrath for trying to halt the deportation of hundreds of Venezuelans to an El Salvador prison with a nationwide injunction challenging the tenuous legal basis for the administration action. Boasberg’s ruling spurred Trump to falsely label him a “radical left lunatic”, urge his impeachment, and then call for him to be disbarred.\n\nMusk has repeatedly used X, the social media platform he owns and on which he has over 200 million followers, to urge impeaching judges whose rulings he doesn’t like. “The only way to restore rule of the people in America is to impeach judges,” he said on 25 February.\n\nLegal scholars say Trump and Musk’s radical threats of impeachment or disbarment for judicial rulings that stall or block administration moves undermine the rule of law.\n\n“Trump and Musk are playing with fire,” said retired Massachusetts judge Nancy Gertner, who is now a lecturer at Harvard Law School. “They’re undermining bedrock constitutional principles.”\n\nShe added: “You can’t shut down a court just because you disagree. The judges have done nothing wrong or inconsistent with their oaths, and nothing outside their judicial roles.”\n\nTrump’s call for impeaching Boasberg drew a sharp and broad rebuke from supreme court chief justice John Roberts, who last month said that “for more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision”.\n\nFurther, contrary to Trump’s baseless charges against Boasberg, the judge’s rulings have hardly been one-sided. One example: Boasberg sided with Trump in 2017 to stop the IRS from sharing his tax returns which a long-shot lawsuit sought.\n\nBesides Boasberg, three other Washington DC judges last month ruled against Trump executive orders targeting law firms he viewed as political foes for retribution, which the judges argued were on dangerous or dubious legal ground.\n\nAmong other things, the Trump orders seek to take away security clearances for some of the law firms and sharply curtail their government business.\n\nTo ratchet up pressures on judges, after judge Beryl Howell issued a decision in March to temporarily block Trump from penalizing the law firm Perkins Coie, the justice department, in a rare move, tried to have Howell removed from the case, alleging she was biased.\n\nIn a blistering response, Howell wrote: “This strategy is designed to impugn the integrity of the federal judicial system and blame any loss on the decision-maker rather than fallacies in the substantive legal arguments presented.”\n\nTwo other DC judges in March backed law firms Jenner & Block and WilmerHale, which sued the administration on first amendment grounds to block executive orders aimed at hurting the firms financially for their separate ties to key lawyers who led a special counsel inquiry into how Russia worked to help elect Trump in 2016.\n\nJudge John Bates, an appointee of George W Bush who issued a restraining order blocking Trump’s sanctions against Jenner & Block, called Trump’s punitive move “disturbing” and “troubling”, noting the order targets the firm’s and its lawyers’ rights under the first amendment, and due process.\n\nLegal scholars and former judges are raising alarms about the rising dangers to the rule of law and the physical safety of judges sparked by the attacks from Trump and his congressional allies.\n\n“While the threats to impeach federal judges based on their decisions are largely performative, they are also designed to foment disrespect for the judiciary and the rule of law,” said former federal judge John Jones, who is now the president of Dickinson College.\n\n“In addition, many of the calls for impeachment are accompanied by the unconscionable disclosure of personal information about individual judges that jeopardize the personal safety of those judges and their family members.”\n\nOther legal experts worry that Trump’s judicial attacks, which some congressional allies are parroting even though the odds of impeaching judges are long, could spark violence.\n\n“The real risk comes not from Congress, but the fringe elements in Trump’s camp, who might be stirred up to threaten or actually inflict harm on the targeted judges,” said former federal prosecutor and Columbia Law School professor Daniel Richman.\n\n“Judges are rightly worried about their safety, and the measures in place to protect them may prove inadequate if the dangerous and irresponsible rhetoric from the Trump camp continues.”\n\nDespite such fears, many of Trump’s hardcore loyalists in Congress are jumping on board to further fuel Trump’s attacks on judges, while benefiting from Musk’s campaign largesse.\n\nAt least seven Republican members, including Andy Ogles of Tennessee and Brandon Gill of Texas, who echoed Trump’s call for impeaching Judge Boasberg, or advocated other “action” against judges who ruled against Trump orders, received checks from Musk for $6,600, the maximum he could donate.\n\nAlthough Republican leaders have suggested that impeachment of judges won’t happen because they don’t have the votes, their public efforts to bolster Trump’s war on judicial independence has been accelerating, with allies exploring other avenues to curb judges.\n\nJohnson turned up the heat on judges on 25 March when he vowed that “desperate times call for desperate measures, and Congress is going to act”. One option eyed by Trump’s Republican allies came up at a judiciary subcommittee hearing last week that focused on banning nationwide injunctions by judges. A House bill to ban such injunctions is expected to pass in coming weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, Charles Grassley, the senator who leads his chamber’s judiciary committee and has received a donation from Musk, held a hearing that also explored bans on nationwide injunctions by judges; Grassley in March introduced a bill that would end the “practice of universal injunctions”, but Senate passage is deemed a long shot.\n\nSome former Republican congressmen are highly critical of Trump’s congressional allies for amplifying his attacks on judges, and predict that the House GOP will try to “monetize” Trump’s fury at a growing number of judges.\n\n“The investigation into judges by Chairman Jordan, and calls by Gill and Ogles for the impeachment of judges who have ruled against Trump, are more examples of blind loyalty to Trump by a bunch of sycophants,” said former Michigan member Dave Trott.\n\n“It would not be such a big deal except for the fact that their conduct is helping create a crisis involving the constitution they swore to uphold.”\n\nTrott added: “And just in case these sycophants suddenly decide to stand up to Trump, Elon is using his billions to help Republicans get re-elected. This will ensure the GOP stays in line. The concentration of great wealth and power is a problem that will have serious consequences for our country.”\n\nOther ex-Republican members voice similar concerns.\n\n“I think this is a talking point and a fundraising tool,’ said Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, adding that members will attack judges for “impeding Trump’s agenda, and they’ll try to monetize it for campaign purposes”.\n\nSome former prosecutors say the judicial attacks by Trump and his GOP allies jibe with Trump’s broader blitz to expand his powers\n\n“Trump has, believe it or not, a strategic plan to disable all opposition,” said former prosecutor Paul Rosenzweig.\n\nPart of that plan “involves eliminating internal oversight, like inspectors general, and cowing external opposition, by threatening law firms. The final piece is to eliminate the last independent check on his authority – judges. To do this he is falsely accusing them of bias and enlisting his sycophantic supporters, like Mike Johnson and Jim Jordan, in the effort.”"

        "full_text": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is heading to Panama City, Panama, on Monday, for a two-day visit to attend the 2025 Central American Security Conference and meet with American troops stationed there.\n\n“The Secretary will meet with partner-nation senior civilian, military, and security leadership in a series of bilateral meetings that will drive ongoing efforts to strengthen our partnerships with Panama and other Central American nations toward our shared vision for a peaceful and secure Western Hemisphere,” Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement.\n\nThe annual conference will be co-hosted by the U.S. and Panama, and will focus on regional defense through joint operations and cybersecurity, according to U.S. Southern Command.\n\nAt the same time, 50 U.S. Marines, in addition to sailors and soldiers, will train alongside Panamanian service members from the Panamanian National Aeronaval Service. As part of the training, the crews of four F-18 Hornets, one C-130 Hercules, one P-8 Poseidon, the USS Chosin and USS Normandy, and the Coast Guard Cutter Kimball will arrive in Panama, Southcom said in a release. According to the Marine Corps, Panamanian and U.S. Marines will train together on naval infantry skills, including marksmanship, land navigation, planning and orders development, and jungle warfare.\n\nHegseth’s visit to Panama takes place as President Donald Trump has called on Panama to give the U.S. better terms on access to the Panama Canal, which the U.S. built in 1914 but agreed to hand over to Panama under President Jimmy Carter. The canal connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and is vital for American military and commercial shipping. Trump has raised concerns about the canal being controlled by China, which Panama has denied.\n\nOn March 4, under Trump, the Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchinson Holding agreed to sell its controlling stake in a subsidiary that operates ports in the canal to a consortium including BlackRock, Inc. — a deal that effectively put the ports under American control. As reported by the Associated Press, the deal gave the consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including at both ends of the Panama Canal, as well as in Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere.\n\nDuring his Joint Address to Congress in March, Trump called for reclaiming the canal. He said in his remarks:\n\nTo further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it. Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals.\n\nThe Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others, but others could use it. But it was built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure. Thirty-eight thousand workers died building the Panama Canal. They died of malaria. They died of snake bites and mosquitoes. Not a nice place to work. They paid them very highly to go there, knowing there was a 25 percent chance that they would die. The most expensive project, also, that was ever built in our country’s history, if you bring it up to modern-day costs.\n\nIt was given away by the Carter administration for $1, but that agreement has been violated very severely. We didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.\n\nEven before his address, Trump talked about the U.S. getting ripped off by “exorbitant” transit fees.\n\nU.S. troops have long been stationed in Panama, to conduct training exercises and exchanges with Panamanian forces, including recent joint training exercises with the countries’ special operations forces."

        "full_text": "The Trump administration’s repeated losses in courts have sparked Republican efforts to limit the reach of the judiciary, something Democrats argue is designed to hamstring reviews of lawless orders.\n\nCongressional Republicans have rolled out two legislative vehicles that would curb nationwide injunctions, arguing this will restore order to the judiciary and put district court judges in their place.\n\n“These rogue judge rulings are a new resistance to the Trump administration and the only time in which judges in robes in this number have felt it necessary to participate in the political process,” Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), the sponsor of one such bill to limit nationwide injunctions, said at a hearing this week.\n\n“The federal judiciary isn’t interpreting the law. It is impeding the presidency. It is, in fact, not co-equal, but holding itself to be superior.”\n\nBut Democrats say the bills are an attack on a system that is rightfully reviewing a record-high number of executive actions from President Trump that exceed the bounds of the law.\n\nDistrict court judges have the power to pause Trump directives they find may be unlawful as the case is further litigated, and under presidents of both parties they’ve imposed those orders on a nationwide basis to protect those across the country who might otherwise be impacted by what could be an illegal action.\n\n“We’ve heard repeated complaints from Republicans about the number of injunctions issued against this president compared to other presidents. Why so many?” said Sen. Dick Durbin (Ill.), the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n“They ignore the fact that this president has issued more than 100 executive orders, the most by any president at this point in his term in at least four decades. Many are clearly illegal,” he added, pointing to Trump’s directive to end birthright citizenship for those born in the U.S. to noncitizen parents.\n\nIn pushing their legislation, Republicans have complained about the power of one judge to stall a Trump directive, citing a string of court cases where judges have least temporarily blocked his policies.\n\nThat includes several judges who have blocked Trump’s attempt to restrict birthright citizenship and a San Francisco-based federal judge who reinstated 16,000 probationary employees fired by the Trump administration.\n\nU.S. District Judge James Boasberg’s ruling temporarily barring the Trump administration from relying on the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants to a Salvadoran prison has sparked attacks of the debate from the right.\n\nLegislation from Issa as well as Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) would bar nationwide injunctions — limiting relief only to the parties that have directly sued as opposed to those who might also be impacted.\n\nSteve Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown University, told lawmakers that applying relief in such a narrow way wouldn’t make sense.\n\n“Consider the birthright citizenship cases. Do we really think that parents should have to challenge that policy one child at a time? Would it make any sense at all, even on a broader scale, for the scope of birthright citizenship to differ in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, simply because those three states fall into three different circuits,” he said during a Wednesday hearing.\n\n“Any time a court invalidates a state or federal law on its face, rather than as applied to the specific plaintiffs, it is necessarily providing relief to non-parties, since the law can no longer be enforced against anyone.”\n\nLegal scholars agree nationwide injunctions didn’t exist at the country’s founding and emerged in the mid-20th century. But in recent years, judges have increasingly issued a flood of such rulings, accompanied by growing scrutiny of their legitimacy.\n\nJudges issued six nationwide injunctions during President George W. Bush’s administration, according to an analysis published in the Harvard Law Review. The number doubled to 12 during the Obama administration before skyrocketing to 64 during Trump’s first term.\n\nDuring the Biden administration, the number of nationwide injunctions fell back to 14, a figure that has already been surpassed in a matter of weeks in the second Trump administration.\n\nRepublicans have repeatedly cited that gap as evidence the judiciary is attempting to thwart Trump’s agenda. But Democrats pin the blame on Trump, saying the dozens of injunctions are merely the result of him implementing illegal policies.\n\nThe conversation often goes hand in hand with complaints that various parties are “judge shopping” by bringing cases in districts they expect to have a more favorable outcome.\n\nDuring the first Trump administration, advocacy groups often brought challenges in California, which oversaw a fair share of litigation on his environmental and immigration policies.\n\nUnder Biden, state attorneys general and others often challenged his immigration policies in Texas.\n\nJust last week, the Trump administration filed a case in a one-judge district in Waco, Texas, asking for a declaration that its plans to halt collective bargaining contracts for federal employees are legal. Unions have challenged Trump’s executive order on the matter in California and D.C.\n\nPrior proposals to curb nationwide injunctions have come from both parties, but the effort is getting a renewed focus under a GOP majority and would likely be signed by Trump, who has also bashed Boasberg and called for him to be impeached.\n\nBoasberg is an appointee of former President Obama who was previously appointed to a local court by former President George W. Bush.\n\nThe House was prepared to take up Issa’s bill this week, only to cancel votes after Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was dealt a blow in his effort to quash a bill on parental proxy voting. A hearing on Grassley’s bill was held this week, though the timing on any vote is unclear.\n\nAs Republican lawmakers push for reform, the Trump administration has repeatedly urged the Supreme Court to take action by filing several pending emergency appeals that all make the case that district judges are going too far.\n\n“Government-by-universal-injunction has persisted long enough, and has reached a fever pitch in recent weeks. It is long past time to restore district courts to their” proper role, the Justice Department wrote in the administration’s birthright citizenship appeal.\n\nIt’s clear the focus on nationwide injunctions is also on the mind of federal judges.\n\nHours after Issa’s hearing, a federal judge overseeing a second suit challenging the Trump administration’s firing of probationary employees declined to extend his injunction nationwide and only applied it to the 19 Democratic-led states that are suing.\n\n“Not every state joined this lawsuit — thirty-one did not. It is sometimes appropriate — even necessary — for courts to issue nationwide injunctions stopping unlawful actions of the Government. But those instances are rare, and this case is not one of them,” wrote U.S. District Judge James Bredar, an Obama appointee in the U.S. District Court for Maryland.\n\nFor his part, Grassley acknowledged that lawmakers often cheer injunctions placed on policies of the president of the opposing party.\n\n“Most of us in this room have at various times supported or opposed universal injunctions. My fellow Republicans and I sometimes like them when there’s a Democratic president, and my Democratic colleagues probably like them right now, even though they criticized them a few months ago under President Biden,” he said.\n\n“Too often we accept politics over principle, but the truth is that we all know this isn’t how government and the judiciary should operate.”\n\nBut Durbin questioned the timing of the GOPs focus on injunctions.\n\n“I’m happy to discuss the legal and practical implications of nationwide injunctions, but as I’ve said many times before we cannot have one set of rules for Republicans and another set of rules for Democrats,” he said.\n\n“Any legislation on this topic must be based on the merits, not political expediency.”"

The U.S. government is finally acting like... a government.\n\nGone are the days when mid-level bureaucrats could sip soy lattes, shuffle papers, ignore actual law, and still walk away with a pension fat enough to rival a small country’s GDP. The message is clear under President Trump’s America First administration: Do your job—or don’t expect to keep it.\n\nIn recent actions, we’ve seen what real leadership looks like when the White House decides enough is enough. First, the Trump administration dropped the hammer on South Sudan by revoking all U.S. visas and halting future visa issuances until the country accepts back its own deportees. Translation: you don’t get to play house in America while pretending you’ve never met your own citizens. Uncle Sam just locked the door and turned off the porch light.\n\nSecond, a Justice Department lawyer was suspended for failing to “zealously advocate” for a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported. Now, if you’re normal, you might say, “Wait, Kevin, doesn’t that contradict the first story?” And that’s where the brilliance of Trump’s team shines.\n\nYes, mistakes happen. They always will. No system is perfect, especially when cleaning up the catastrophic mess left by the last guy who thought borders were optional and laws were theoretical. But the Trump administration understands—and what the Biden team never did—that the risk of mistakes can’t become a license for paralysis.\n\nYou cannot build an immigration policy—or any policy—on the fear of error. That’s what the Obama-Biden years gave us: endless “reviews,” “task forces,” and “comprehensive strategies” that produced nothing but press releases and photo ops. Trump, by contrast, is doing something revolutionary in government: He’s doing things.\n\nWe are now deporting illegal immigrants at record-shattering levels. No more “catch-and-release.” No more disappearing into sanctuary cities like some criminal edition of Where’s Waldo? We’re talking about action that respects American sovereignty, prioritizes national security, and—dare I say it—restores sanity.\n\nIs there a cost to bold action? Of course. Sometimes, a mistake slips through, like the Maryland case. But what happened there separates the men from the mush: the Trump administration held their own accountable. The lawyer who didn’t go to bat for the deportee got benched.\n\nLet me say that again for the back row: Accountability in Washington.\n\nThat loud sound you just heard was every career bureaucrat at DHS spitting out their herbal tea.\n\nThe bigger picture is this: the executive branch isn’t a suggestion box. It’s a command center. Under Trump, the orders are clear: enforce the law, protect the citizens, and serve the country. The Department of Homeland Security, ICE, State, and DOJ are no longer bumper sticker factories. They’re the operational arms of a president who actually expects results.\n\nEven our allies are being told to get off the sidelines. South Sudan, a nation with which we have diplomatic ties, was given a choice: take back your people or lose your access. This is how real foreign policy works. You want a seat at the table? Pick up a fork and help set it. Otherwise, you’re eating outside with the kids.\n\nAnd let’s not overlook who’s been empowered to drive this train. You’ve got Pam Bondi, the no-nonsense legal hammer from Florida. You’ve got Marco Rubio, who has transitioned from Senate speech-maker to surgical policy enforcer. These aren’t people playing checkers. They’re playing chess—on fire.\n\nMeanwhile, what did we get under Biden? A Homeland Security Secretary who couldn’t define the word “secure,” a press secretary who needed a flashcard to find Texas on a map, and a border czar who thought the solution to illegal immigration was a Zoom call with Guatemalan farmers. It was cosplay government—a costume party of incompetence.\n\nBut now? There are grown-ups in the room. And they’re not asking for permission.\n\nI know what the critics say. “Trump’s mean.” “Trump’s impulsive.” “Trump doesn’t color inside the lines.” First, the lines were drawn by people who didn’t know what they were doing. And second, if being “nice” means sacrificing national security for cocktail party invites, I’ll take the bulldozer every time.\n\nAmerica is in a new era—one where excellence is expected, mistakes are corrected, and doing nothing is no longer acceptable. The bureaucratic blob that once choked off action through endless memos and inaction is shrinking under the heat of accountability. It turns out that when the President is awake and working, things happen.\n\nAnd here’s the profound truth that should leave every patriotic American gobsmacked:\n\nA government that fears doing the wrong thing more than it desires doing the right thing will never do anything worth remembering.\n\nPresident Trump has flipped that script. He’s not afraid to act, correct, or demand results.\n\nFinally, America has a government that governs again. What a concept.\n\nKevin McCullough is a nationally syndicated columnist with Townhall.com and host of “That KEVIN Show” on Salem News Channel, BizTV, and Salem Radio Network."

        "full_text": "Already facing criticism over his ties to President Donald Trump, Wayne Gretzky was once again seen alongside FBI director Kash Patel as Washington Capitals star Alex Ovechkin scored another historic goal on Sunday on Long Island.\n\nThis time it was Ovechkin's 895 career score, which broke Gretzky's all-time mark on Sunday afternoon against the New York Islanders at UBS Arena.\n\nAnd as was the case when the Russian icon tied Gretzky at 894 on Thursday in Washington, Gretzky was taking in the action with his wife, Janet, and one of Trump's key insiders in Patel. Later, Patel and Gretzky joined NHL commissioner Gary Bettman in the Capitals' locker room after the 4-1 loss to the Islanders.\n\n'Was that Kash Patel next to Gretzky?' one fan asked on X, echoing a question asked by countless others on both sides of the US-Canadian border.\n\nAnother joked: 'Did Kash Patel get adopted by the Gretzky's (sic)?'\n\n'Gretzky having Kash Patel be his guest for the last two games is the lowest of notches,' a Philadelphia-area sports fan added.\n\nThe popular @WuTangKids account was similarly displeased to see Patel in the VIP box: 'So Kash Patel just hangs out with Gretzky now going to watch Ovechkin beat the goal record on Long Island smh.'\n\nBut nobody is angrier over Gretzky's ties to Trump's inner circle than native Canadians.\n\n'Pretty sure Gretzky first shook the hand of his good buddy Kash Patel,' one critic wrote on X. 'Gretz' is a traitor to Canada.'\n\n'Gretzky with his good buddy Kash Patel--who wants to make Canada the 51st state,' they added. 'Canada should revoke Gretzky's citizenship.'\n\nTrump has stated on multiple occasions his desire to make Canada America's 51st, and has since doubled down on the animosity between the two countries by adding tariffs to Canadian goods.\n\nLast month, a famed Gretzky statue in Edmonton was smeared with feces after the Oilers legend attended post-election parties at the President's club in Palm Beach, Florida as well as the inauguration in Washington.\n\nBut, amid the two countries' unfolding trade war, it was Gretzky's presence as Team Canada's honorary captain at the NHL's recent 4 Nations championship that really infuriated some of his countrymen.\n\nMany have criticized Gretzky for failing to wear team colors at Canada's overtime win over Team USA in Boston. Others, meanwhile, focused on Gretzky's ties to Trump.\n\n'Just going to state this matter-of-factly,' Canadian-based TSN reporter Dave Naylor wrote on X, 'the honorary captain for Canada in this game publicly supports a political leader whose position is that Canada should not exist as a nation.'\n\nBut he did get support from a fellow Hockey Hall of Famer in Boston Bruins great Bobby Orr.\n\nIn an op-ed piece for the Toronto Sun, the Ontario native defended Gretzky, who famously won several major international competitions as captain of Team Canada during his playing days.\n\n'For the life of me, I cannot understand why the 'haters' have decided to go after Wayne because he 'didn't wear a Canadian jersey' during his introduction at the final match,' Orr wrote. 'I, for one, thought that he looked very dignified while representing Canada with class and professionalism.\n\n'Remember, this is a man who wore the Maple Leaf on multiple occasions with pride,' Orr continued. 'As both a player and administrator, he has brought nothing but glory to his homeland year after year, decade after decade.'\n\nCuriously, Orr's column makes no direct mention of Trump.\n\nIt does, however, work to remind Canadians that Gretzky is one of them.\n\n'Wayne is a guy from Brantford, Ont., who made good and has done nothing throughout his life but give aid and assistance to innumerable Canadians along the way,' Orr concluded.\n\n'Please, let's take a time out. Extend a little grace, and a little respect for a good man and a great Canadian.'\n\nThis isn't the first time Canada has been at war with itself over Gretzky. The trade that sent him from Edmonton to Los Angeles continues to haunt the country, even after the Oilers won the 1990 Stanley Cup without him.\n\nThen there was Gretzky's support for then-President George W. Bush's controversial 'War on Terror' in 2003. With the country divided America's invasion of Iraq, critics hung a sign reading 'U$ Lackey'' around a Gretzky statue in Edmonton.\n\nGretzky did attend Trump's election victory party at Mar-a-Lago, where the two golf aficionados and their families were seen celebrating together.\n\nJanet Jones, Gretzky's long-time wife, shared a picture of her husband with Trump on social media, which appeared to anger liberal hockey fans last month.\n\n'You have to really question someone's ethics and logic supporting someone like Trump,' one user posted.\n\n'Apparently there is an inverse relationship between hockey skills and intelligence,' another added.\n\nOne said: 'Few things on earth more embarrassing than Canadian maga weirdos'.\n\nBut while Gretzky was getting criticized by Canadian hockey fans, he was embraced by Trump, who suggested the NHL's all-time leading scorer should run for Prime Minister.\n\n'I have some many great friends,' the 78-year-old Trump said to a crowd at Mar-a-Lago in January. 'One of them is the ''Great One .'' I said, ''Run for Prime Minister, you'll win… It will take two seconds.''\n\n'He said, ''Well, am I gonna run for Prime Minister or Governor? You tell me,''' Trump continued.\n\n'I said: ''I dunno, let's make it Governor. I like that better.''\n\nFamously preoccupied by America's trade deficit with Canada, Trump previously suggested the country's 10 provinces and three territories should become the 51st state. He even tweeted about the idea on Christmas Day, offering Gretzky as a potential 'Governor of Canada.'\n\n'You would win easily, you wouldn't have to campaign,' Trump wrote in his Truth Social post.\n\nAlas, Gretzky did not seem eager to become the Prime Minister or Governor of Canada, according to Trump.\n\n'He had no interest, but I think the people of Canada should start a DRAFT WAYNE GRETZKY Movement,' Trump added. 'It would be so much fun to watch!'"

        "full_text": "More than three decades ago, Congress launched an initiative called the U.S. Global Change Research Program. Today, it spends billions of dollars a year empowering liberal climate scientists to spread climate change doom.\n\nThe government group says its role is to provide the “scientific foundation to support informed decision-making across the United States” on climate change. It’s done so by producing five National Climate Assessment reports, which are considered the “crown jewel” of climate research.\n\nDespite taking funding from at least ten separate government agencies, producing the report seems to be the group’s sole function. The most recent iteration — published in 2023 and still prominently showcased on its government website — warns that “severe climate risks to the United States will continue to grow.” The next report is due out in the next couple of years, according to E&E News.\n\nThe National Climate Assessment is not simply an intellectual exercise, but rather one that carries real policy might. Congress and agencies use it to justify regulations and funding decisions, and states and cities across the country lean on it as the non-partisan scientific foundation for their own climate action plans. In summary, it is the scientific bedrock for directing policy at all levels of government towards liberal climate change goals.\n\nWhile the U.S. Global Change Research Program states on its website that it has a budget of $4.95 billion in 2025, it only lists two full-time employees. So, who’s getting paid to put the massive and consequential report together?\n\nSources familiar with past iterations of the National Climate Assessment say the work is largely outsourced to a group called ICF, a massive government contractor that has an active contract to work on the report. The Daily Wire identified at least one active contract from NASA for ICF to “support” the U.S. Global Change Research Program. ICF is set to be paid millions of dollars during the Trump administration to “assist the nation and the world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global change.”\n\nThe contract was first announced in June 2021, and described as a $34 million, five-year contract to help with the National Climate Assessments. Only $18 million has been paid out, according to the government spending database. But with another assessment on deck and ICF under contract for another year, the additional $16 million could be disbursed in the next year.\n\nA climate scientist who has worked on the National Climate Assessment in the past says ICF runs the show, virtually controlling the entire U.S. Global Change Research Program.\n\n“By providing all staff for the USGCRP, a federal agency, the ICF exerts undue influence over the global change narrative and priorities presented by the federal government,” said the official, who requested anonymity to discuss the work. “The ICF, through the USGCRP, exerts an undue influence on the production of the National Climate Assessment every four years. With the exception of its Executive Director and the Director of the National Climate Assessment, the ICF supplies all staff associated with the USGCRP.”\n\nThose two positions mentioned by the climate official are the only two employees listed on the U.S. Global Change Research Program staff list: a director of the National Climate Assessment named Ariela Zycherman, and a deputy director for services named Heidi Roop.\n\nA top Trump administration official, Russell Vought, has signaled that he wanted to exert more oversight over the next climate assessment. Vought runs the powerful Office of Management and Budget, and has openly stated that he wants to make deep cuts to “woke and weaponized” spending.\n\nVought has specifically called out the U.S. Global Change Research Program’s report, arguing that the bureaucrats who write it end up with outsized power over government action. He’s called for an investigation of the political leanings of the contractors that assemble the report.\n\nBoth staffers listed by U.S. Global Change Research Program appear to be highly partisan actors. Zycherman last year contributed to the presidential campaigns of both Joe Biden and then Kamala Harris, according to campaign finance records. Roop has her pronouns in her Instagram bio and describes herself as a “climate scientist focused on preparing for a warmer world.”\n\nAnd ICF is an incredibly partisan firm. Its website boasts about its “corporate citizenship,” “culture and belonging,” and “environmental justice.” Several blogs are posted on its site about how to infuse “equity” into “climate discussions,” support EV mandates, and advance “environmental justice.” Perhaps most telling, nearly all of the officials its website lists as being part of the ICF Climate Team are Democrat donors, giving to candidates including Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. The Daily Wire was unable to spot any contributions to Republicans.\n\nICF takes in far more in government contracts than its active $34 million from NASA. An analysis of federal spending data found that the consulting firm rakes in hundreds of millions of dollars each year through federal contracts, and took in over $2 billion during the Biden administration.\n\nThe consulting firm is likely aware that the scope of its government work could be slashed during Trump’s term, and so are investors. Its stock price was at $171 a share days ahead of last November’s election, but has since cratered to just $77 a share, the lowest it had been since the last time Trump was president.\n\n(Yes, the stock price fell before the current market volatility caused by tariffs).\n\nHouston Keene, a former journalist who now leads a government transparency organization, argues that unnamed government consultants shouldn’t be paid millions to chart the nation’s climate policy.\n\n“The public deserves an honest assessment from the government on the state of climate science,” Keene said. “That requires an objective, nonpartisan author who does not have financial interests in the outcome. ICF appears to be none of these things.”\n\n“There can be no proper assessment with scientific integrity when a clearly partisan and financially conflicted activist organization is holding the pen,” he said.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Global Change Research Program website, NASA is providing a significant chunk of the initiative’s budget in 2025. It is unclear whether the money NASA is slated to pay ICF for its work on the assessment is included in that budget.\n\nThus far, there has been no announcement by the administration regarding the U.S. Global Change Research Program, its contract with ICF, or the status of the next assessment. Neither ICF nor the U.S. Global Change Research Program responded to requests for comment."

        "full_text": "Thousands of people in the UK have been detained and questioned by police over online posts deemed threatening or offensive, The Times has reported, citing custody data.\n\nAccording to figures published on Friday, officers make around 12,000 arrests annually under Section 127 of the Communications Act 2003 and Section 1 of the Malicious Communications Act 1988. These laws criminalize causing distress by sending messages that are “grossly offensive,” or by sharing content of an “indecent, obscene or menacing character” via electronic communications networks.\n\nIn 2023 alone, officers from 37 police forces made 12,183 arrests – around 33 per day. The Times said this marks a 58% increase from 2019, when 7,734 arrests were recorded.\n\nAt the same time, government data shows that convictions and sentencings have dropped by nearly a half. While some cases were resolved through out-of-court settlements, the most commonly cited reason was “evidential difficulties,” particularly when victims declined to proceed.\n\nThe statistics have sparked public outcry, with civil liberties groups accusing the authorities of overpolicing the internet and undermining free speech through the use of “vague” communications laws.\n\nThe Times highlighted the case of Maxie Allen and Rosalind Levine, who were arrested on January 29 after raising concerns in a private parents’ WhatsApp group about the hiring process of their daughter’s school. Six uniformed officers arrived at their home, detained them in front of their youngest child, and took them to a police station.\n\nThe couple was questioned on suspicion of harassment, malicious communications, and causing a nuisance on school property after the school alleged they had “cast aspersions” about the chair of governors. They were fingerprinted, searched, and locked in a cell for eight hours.\n\n“It was hard to shake off the sense that I was living in a police state,” Allen told the Daily Mail, adding that the messages contained “no offensive language or threat” but were simply a “bit sarcastic.”"

        "full_text": "The US Commerce Secretary has defended the country's decision to impose tariffs on a group of uninhabited islands, which are populated only by penguins and seals.\n\nThe imposition of tariffs on the Heard and McDonald islands was meant to close \"ridiculous loopholes\" and would prevent other countries from shipping through the islands to reach the US, Howard Lutnick told the BBC's US partner CBS.\n\nAuthorities in Australia reacted with surprise last week when they found out about the tariffs on the island, which sits 4,000km (2,485 mi) from Australia.\n\nIts trade minister Don Farrell told news outlet ABC that the imposition of tariffs was \"clearly a mistake\" indicating a \"rushed process\".\n\nBut when asked about the inclusion of the Australian territory on Trump's tariffs list, Lutnick said: \"If you leave anything off the list, the countries that try to basically arbitrage America go through those countries to us.\"\n\n\"The President knows that, he's tired of it, and he's going to fix that.\"\n\nLutnick's interview was one of several given by US government officials to defend the president's new tariffs after all three major stock indexes in the US plunged more than 5% on Friday, in the worst week for the US stock market since 2020.\n\nShipping products through one port to another in a process known as transshipment is common in global trade. But Pew Charitable Trusts, a public policy organisation, says this method can also \"enable bad actors to obscure or manipulate data\" around the shipping events.\n\nThe NGO estimates that hundreds of millions of dollars of tuna and similar species are illegally moved via this method in the western and central Pacific each year.\n\nIt's difficult to get a clear picture on the imports from the Heard and McDonald islands to the US.\n\nAccording to export data from the World Bank, the islands have, over the past few years, usually exported a small amount of products to the US.\n\nBut in 2022 the US imported US$1.4m (A$2.23m; £1.08m) ) from the territory, nearly all of it unnamed \"machinery and electrical\" products.\n\nAlso included on Trump's list was the British Indian Ocean territory, which is solely occupied by military personnel and requires a permit to visit. World Bank export data shows the territory exported US$414,350 to the US in 2022."

        "full_text": "Jeremy Sharon is The Times of Israel’s legal affairs and settlements reporter\n\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) sent a request to the Hungarian government to arrest and surrender Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to its detention center in The Hague, due to the arrest warrant issued against him by the court last year, it emerged on Sunday.\n\nAccording to a report by Channel 12 news, the surrender request was sent several hours after Netanyahu landed in the country on Thursday, but the Hungarian government refused to comply, and promptly announced it was quitting the ICC.\n\nIn May 2024, ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan requested from the court that it approve arrest warrants against Netanyahu and then-defense minister Yoav Gallant on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The court approved the request in November 2024 and rejected Israeli appeals against them.\n\nThe warrants accuse the Israeli leader of directing attacks against the civilian population of Gaza and of using starvation as a method of warfare by hindering the supply of international aid to Gaza, during the current conflict with Hamas, which began with the terror organization’s onslaught against Israel on October 7, 2023.\n\nICC warrants require all member states of the court to detain and surrender the subject of the order to The Hague.\n\nNetanyahu and the government have strongly rejected the allegations, pointing to efforts to facilitate the passage of large amounts of humanitarian aid into Gaza during the war, and insisting that the IDF does not deliberately target civilians.\n\nThe Supreme Court, acting in its capacity as the High Court of Justice, ruled last month that organizations that petitioned the court to order the government to increase the supply of aid to Gaza had “not even come close” to showing that Israel had violated legal prohibitions on starving a civilian population as a tool of war or as a form of collective punishment.\n\nIn the document sent to the Hungarian government on Thursday, the ICC wrote that its surrender request was “confidential” in order to enable the arrest to be executed. ICC arrest and surrender procedures are often kept secret in order to maximize the possibility of arresting the subject of a warrant.\n\nThe document also featured Netanyahu’s personal details, including place and date of birth, and the allegations against him.\n\n“The Registrar requests the cooperation of Hungary to: Provisionally arrest the following person [Netanyahu] when the opportunity to do so arises in the event that he is present on their territory.” the arrest and surrender request stated.\n\nThe Hungarian government announced its decision to withdraw from the ICC several hours after Netanyahu arrived.\n\nSupporting The Times of Israel isn’t a transaction for an online service, like subscribing to Netflix.

        "full_text": "It’s been a long time coming, but Alex Ovechkin can finally call himself the NHL’s all-time leading scorer with number 895 on Sunday.\n\nThe 39-year-old overtook Wayne Gretzky’s mark of 894 goals after scoring in the second period in the Washington Capitals 4-1 loss to the New York Islanders in Elmont, New York.\n\nOvechkin rocketed a wrist shot past goalie and fellow Russian Ilya Sorokin as the left winger’s family and Gretzky looked on at UBS Arena.\n\nIt was a power play goal, which was fitting – no one in NHL history has ever scored more power play goals than the Russian ace.\n\nOvechkin netted his 42nd tally of the season, which is the third most in the league.\n\nThe game paused after Ovechkin’s goal for a ceremony to recognize his achievement.\n\n“What a day?” he told the crowd. Ovechkin thanked his teammates, the Capitals organization, coaches, his family, the fans and yes, Sorokin, for letting him get the record.\n\n“It’s a team sport. Without my boys, I would never stand there and obviously I would never pass a great one,” he said. “We did it, boys, we did it.\n\n“Thank you, (Ilya Sorokin) to let me score 895 … and the last thing, all of you fans, for all the world, Russia, we did it, boys, we did it. It’s a history!”\n\nThe fans chanted “Ovi! Ovi! Ovi!” after he finished speaking.\n\nGretzky told the fans he doesn’t think Ovechkin’s record, the one he held for more than 31 years, will be broken.\n\n“We’re here today to celebrate this guy here, number eight. I can tell you firsthand I know how hard it is to get 894. Eight-ninety-five is pretty special,” Gretzky said.\n\n“They say records are made to be broken, but I’m not sure who’s going to get more goals than that.”\n\nGretzky jokingly told Capitals owner Ted Leonsis when he broke the goals record, he was given a Rolls-Royce and the owner is going to have to think of a gift for his star.\n\nOvechkin is the 10th player in the league’s 107-year history to hold the all-time goals leader title (either outright or tied). He is the fourth to claim that distinction in the last 72 years, following Gretzky, Gordie Howe and Maurice Richard.\n\n“To reach this milestone and pass Wayne Gretzky, which is something nobody thought possible, truly is special,” Mark Howe, the son of Gordie Howe, said in a statement. “It’s great for you, great for your family and great for the National Hockey League.”\n\nMaurice RIchard Jr., the son of Maurice Richard, added: “On behalf of the Richard family, I would like to congratulate Alex Ovechkin for achieving what everybody thought was impossible: beating Wayne Gretzky’s record of 894 goals.”\n\nAmongst the many who congratulated Ovechkin were 23-time Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps, six-time Stanley Cup champion Mark Messier, four-time NBA champion LeBron James, seven-time Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles and five-time World Series champion Derek Jeter in a tribute video broadcasted on TNT Sports.\n\nIn his 20th NHL season, many had been waiting for him to overtake the record this year. The Russian finally did so having played the same amount of games — 1,487 — that Gretzky managed during his 20-year career.\n\nWhile many had expected Ovechkin to break the record this season, the broken fibula he sustained in November delayed his march toward what many once considered an unassailable mark. The Capitals star, though, recovered quickly to get back on track.\n\nIn March, Ovechkin announced a charity partnership which would see him donate money after every goal he scores until the end of his career to raise funds for pediatric cancer research.\n\nOvechkin has played all 20 of his NHL seasons with Washington, leading the team to its only Stanley Cup win in 2018. Earlier this year, he joined Gordie Howe as the only NHL players in history to rack up 20 goals in 20 straight seasons.\n\nHe has also amassed nine seasons of 50+ goals – including a career-high 65 in 2007-08 –been named an All-Star 12 times, league MVP three times, and in 2017 was honored as one of the best 100 NHL players of all time.\n\nA year later, he lifted the Stanley Cup for the first time as his Capitals dispatched the expansion Las Vegas Golden Knights in five games.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information."

        "full_text": "Earlier this year, I testified before the Colorado legislature in opposition to House Bill 25-1109, which would have required death certificates to reflect decedents’ “gender identity,” rather than their sex. The proposal was self-evidently absurd—death certificates are legal documents, not tributes to decedents’ subjective sense of self. Nevertheless, the legislature passed the bill, which awaits Governor Jared Polis’s signature.\n\nNow, Colorado lawmakers have gone a step further. A new proposal, House Bill 25-1312, would make “deadnaming” and “misgendering” children—that is, not using their preferred name or pronouns—a factor in child-custody disputes. Under the Kelly Loving Act, parents who refuse to use their child’s chosen name or pronouns, even out of sincere concern for the child’s well-being, would be deemed to be exercising “coercive control,” and therefore liable to lose custody.\n\nInstead of ensuring children’s safety, this bill would mandate speech, codify a radical ideology into law, and weaponize family courts to enforce compliance.\n\nThe bill is framed in terms of preventing “harm” and “abuse,” which relies on the popular claim that “gender-affirming care” is a form of suicide prevention. Despite the frequency with which such claims get repeated, no good evidence exists suggesting that “gender-affirming” treatments—social transition, puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, surgeries—are grounded in rigorous, evidence-based medicine. On the contrary, every systematic review conducted to date has concluded that the evidence supporting these interventions is of very low quality.\n\nBy insisting that parents affirm their child’s identity, the bill pushes the “social transition” aspect of “gender-affirming care,” which entails changing a child’s name, pronouns, clothing, and behavior to align with his asserted “gender identity.” Proponents often portray social transition as a benign and cost-free intervention. But as Mia Hughes, a senior researcher at Genspect, noted in her testimony before the Colorado House Committee against the proposal, “affirming” a child in his delusion sets him up for a lifetime of regret:\n\nThere are consequences to lying to a child. A parent telling their sweet effeminate boy who liked Barbies and princess gowns that he can be a girl may solve his distress in the short term. It is, after all, not easy to be different. It may seem to be in that little boy’s best interest to use the female name and female pronouns, and a court may decide that he is better off with the affirming parent. But this is short-sighted. Social transition comes at such an enormous cost in the future. . . . Socially transitioning children sets off a chain reaction that can lead to becoming a life-long medical patient. Therefore, this bill has got it backwards. Socially transitioning a child is a form of coercive control that strips away the child’s sense of self, robs them of their bodily integrity, and violates their right to go through puberty.\n\nHughes is exactly right.\n\nPsychologist Kenneth Zucker, an expert in gender dysphoria, similarly warned in a 2019 paper that social transition can inappropriately cement a child’s cross-sex identity. In that paper, he predicted that social transition would “increase dramatically” the rate at which transitioned children’s gender dysphoria persisted compared with children with gender dysphoria not socially transitioned.\n\nHe proved correct. A 2022 study by Kristina Olson and colleagues found that a shocking 97.5 percent of transgender-identifying “youth who socially transitioned at early ages continued to identify that way.” Nearly 60 percent of such children will continue on to puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, and many will pursue surgeries. In the years before widespread social transition, by contrast, most young children with gender dysphoria—about 80 percent—eventually desisted and accepted their bodies as they grew into adulthood.\n\nRather than view socially transitioned children’s persistent gender dysphoria as a red flag, activists hail it as validation. Azeen Ghorayshi, writing about Olson’s study for the New York Times, said that the results reflected “societal acceptance of gender diversity” and increasingly supportive parents, both of which allow “transgender children” to “thrive in their identities.” Olson, in an interview with Healthline, argued that the persistence rate debunks the notion that “a five or six-year-old who is insisting that they are a gender that does not align with their sex at birth can’t possibly know their gender, or that this is just a ‘phase.’”\n\nThese are deeply flawed interpretations. If social transition were truly a harmless way for kids to explore their identities, we’d expect a significant number to decide eventually that they aren’t transgender, given the numbers that historically desisted when left alone. Instead, nearly all those who are socially transitioned persist in the rejection of their natal sex.\n\nI’ve often asked supporters of gender-affirming care: If 97.5 percent persistence after social transition doesn’t concern you, what number would? I am still waiting for a response. The truth, for many activists, is that any outcome serves as proof that gender-affirming care is working.\n\nThis kind of unfalsifiable thinking is now shaping public policy. Colorado’s Kelly Loving Act defines “deadnaming” and “misgendering” as forms of “coercive control”—a term traditionally used to describe domestic abusers who isolate, intimidate, and manipulate their victims. In custody disputes, the bill orders courts to favor parents who affirm their child’s identity and to disfavor parents who don’t.\n\nYet skeptical parents are often the only ones who can protect their children from harmful medical treatments. Many detransitioners—people who once identified as transgender but no longer do—speak of a parent who slowed things down, asked difficult questions, and refused to affirm their recently adopted cross-sex or “nonbinary” identity. Maintaining this tether to reality provided a safe and shame-free way out.\n\nThe Kelly Loving Act would punish such parents and reward those who set their child on an irreversible path of life-long medicalization. On April 2, the bill cleared the state house’s Judiciary Committee, with all seven Democrats voting in favor, and all four Republicans in opposition. On April 6, it passed the full state house with overwhelming Democratic support. It now moves to the state senate, where Democrats hold a 23-12 edge. If the bill clears the senate, it will land on the desk of Governor Polis, who has signed similar legislation simplifying the process for changing sex on IDs and banning so-called “conversion therapy” with respect to “gender identity,” which prevents gender clinicians from questioning patients’ transgender identity and trying to make them comfortable in their natural bodies.\n\nIf Polis signs the bill, Colorado will enshrine into law the notion that protecting a child from irreversible and unnecessary medical treatments constitutes abuse. This is precisely the opposite of the truth. Kids with gender dysphoria—and the parents who refuse to lie to them—deserve better."

        "full_text": "Rats don’t always have the best reputations, but one named Ronin with a super sense of smell is working to change that.\n\nRonin and his landmine-sniffing rat pack are making a name for rodents everywhere by saving innocent civilians from hidden explosives.\n\nThe African giant pouched rat recently set a new world record for the most landmines detected by a rat. Between August 2021 and February 2025, Ronin uncovered 109 landmines and 15 other pieces of unexploded ordnance in a region close to Siem Reap in Cambodia, according to Guinness World Records.\n\n“Ronin’s achievements are a testament to the incredible potential of rats,” his main handler Phanny told the Guinness publication.\n\nLandmines are a major issue in former conflict zones. The explosive weapons, hidden in the ground, are designed to injure or kill anyone who passes over them. In Cambodia alone, they have caused more than 65,000 deaths and injuries since the fall of the brutal Khmer Rouge regime in 1979, according to the Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor.\n\nTheir use is controversial because of their indiscriminate nature and the threat they pose for decades after a conflict has ended, killing and maiming and hampering land development in war-ravaged areas.\n\nThey are also notoriously difficult and dangerous to detect. That’s where rats come in; their high intelligence, speed and keen sense of smell make them adept at identifying explosives. They are also too light to trigger landmines.\n\nIt’s crucial work. An estimated 110 million landmines are still buried in over 60 countries around the world, said landmine detection nonprofit APOPO. In 2023, landmines caused 5,757 casualties globally — 37% of which involved children, according to the 2024 Landmine Monitor.\n\nRonin is one of more than 100 rats trained by APOPO to detect the scent of the explosive chemicals and point landmines out to their handlers.\n\nThe rats are highly versatile and have also been trained to detect tuberculosis in medical settings, helping to prevent the spread of infectious disease.\n\nThe Belgian nonprofit’s team of landmine-sniffing rats can search an area the size of a tennis court in 30 minutes – something that could take a deminer with a metal detector up to four days.\n\nRonin, who is 5 years old and was born in Tanzania, is much larger than your average pet rat. He is more than 2 feet long – about the length of a cat – and weighs 2.6 pounds, according to APOPO.\n\nCambodia’s Preah Vihear province, where Ronin was deployed has one of the highest landmine densities in the world following decades of conflict in the 20th century, including heavy bombing by the US during the Vietnam War.\n\nThe US dropped 2.7 million tons of ordnance – including cluster bombs and submunitions – in a four-year carpet-bombing campaign in Cambodia. Up to a quarter of the cluster bombs failed to explode, meaning they stayed active and dangerous but out of sight, according to a 2019 report by the US Congressional Research Service.\n\nDespite years of demining efforts, there are still an estimated 4 to 6 million unexploded landmines in Cambodia, according to APOPO."

        "full_text": "Last week, President Donald Trump's administration turned its chainsaws on the Department of Energy (DOE), cutting, canceling, or pausing a handful of onerous regulations set to hobble household and commercial appliances. Anyone who's coughed up a small fortune for a barely functional machine lately knows the stakes.\n\nMy 30-year-old Bosch dishwasher was a marvel—efficient, precise—scouring dishes in 45 minutes like a Prussian drill sergeant on a deadline. Last month, it died. I dropped $800 on a sleek successor, expecting progress. Instead, I got a two-hour grease-smearing farce that leaves forks, like my optimism, caked in the grime of dashed hopes—a victim of the DOE's regulatory straitjacket.\n\nMy 1979 brick ranch creaks on into senescence, its heater, air-conditioning, fans, and water heater—bastions of a bygone era of appliance liberty—teetering. Replacing them likely means paying thousands of dollars for lesser-able machines. That's been the story for decades: as tech leaps forward, appliances regress. Until now.\n\nIn February, Trump's DOE postponed three Biden-era efficiency rules related to central A.C. and heat pumps, walk-in coolers and freezers, and gas tankless water heaters. It also carved a special regulatory category, freeing tankless heaters from Biden's near-ban. Just last week, the DOE cut four more rules outright—impacting ceiling fans, dehumidifiers, external power supplies, and the electric motors that power almost everything. This isn't just red tape slashed—it's a rare win for choice and function over dogma. What exactly did we dodge? A lot.\n\nTake electric motor mandates—these rules hit everything from your blender to your garage compressor. They aimed to tighten already-strict regulations and expand them to even more motors in everyday appliances. Ostensibly, the goal was to reduce electricity use and emissions. Sounds noble—until you realize what it does to the products we actually use.\n\nThese motors skimp on low-end torque, hobbling appliances that need a quick jolt—think A.C. units gasping to start or a blender stalling on ice. They're slower to respond and less precise. And because they require rare earth metals and heavier materials, they make devices bulkier—your cordless drill suddenly feels like a lead pipe.\n\nWorse, these high-efficiency designs come with a high-efficiency price tag. Costs shoot up, and U.S. manufacturers—after burning capital on redesigns and retooling—struggle to compete with countries that don't play by the same regulatory rulebook.\n\nThe proposed charger rules carried similar baggage. Those familiar bricks were slated for \"standby\" efficiency upgrades, which would draw less power when idle—but also slow charging and tack on extra cost. Another small freedom sacrificed to make a number in a lab look better.\n\nEach of these rules hit manufacturers with retooling costs, consumers with higher bills, and our homes with clunkier gear.\n\nMy dishwasher is the poster child. A 5-gallon water limit (10 CFR 430.32) strangles it—my old Bosch used ten gallons. A 307 kWh/year energy cap starves its heater and pump—my German-engineered gem used to shoot scalding water and dry dishes in minutes. New efficiency rules bloated cycles to more than two hours just to scrape at grease—four when I have to double wash.\n\nCeiling fans that cost more and barely move air, dehumidifiers that take too long to stop mold from moving in, tankless water heaters priced like luxury items yet reduced to a trickle, A.C. units bloated with \"efficiency\" tech but still wheezing through heat waves—these were all narrowly avoided. However, dozens more remain—rules that hike prices, gut performance, and drive out American manufacturers in favor of compliant mediocrity. This isn't about saving the planet. It's about feeding a machine that's been running since the late '80s.\n\nIt all started in 1987, when President Ronald Reagan—prodded by California regulators and General Electric lobbyists—signed the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act. It was meant to simplify a chaotic state-by-state patchwork. Instead, it handed Washington control of everything from your showerhead to your stove. By 1992, Congress doubled down with the Energy Policy Act, and industry giants like Whirlpool saw the angle: back the rules, get the tax breaks, and freeze out smaller competition. In the 2000s, Bush-era energy bills brought green nonprofits and manufacturers into open collusion—subsidies for submission—while appliance lifespans quietly cratered, from 30 years to 10.\n\nThe DOE boasted that its 1996 rules saved 26 million metric tons of carbon dioxide—about 2 percent of national emissions. But that figure is a bloated fantasy, based on lab conditions and imaginary consumer behavior. Meanwhile, in the real world, people ran longer cycles, rewashed by hand, and used more water and energy to make up the difference.\n\nThese regulations stack up like bad sequels—each more expensive, less effective, and harder to defend than the last. The low-flow toilet that takes two flushes, the washer that needs a second cycle, the showerhead that sputters like a garden hose with arthritis. Trump's latest cuts nick the beast. But it's still alive.\n\nLast week's rollback swings the pendulum toward sanity—I hope. My $800 dishwasher still mocks me, but my fans, heater, and A.C. might dodge that fate. It's a small dent in decades of regulatory lunacy that's burdened makers, killed innovation, and trashed our kitchens."

        "full_text": "Oil prices on the U.S. and European benchmarks fell Monday to their lowest level since April 2021. The tumble began Wednesday after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on almost all U.S. trading partners. Within a day of the announcement, OPEC announced it would increase production by 411,000 barrels per day.\n\nExperts differ on whether it was the tariffs or OPEC that had the greater impact on the drop in prices. There’s also considerable debate on what OPEC hopes to accomplish by dumping more oil on the international market that’s already experiencing a lot of downward pressure.\n\nMost experts agree that the low prices will result in a reduced oil output, and if the situation continues, it could spell problems for the industry.\n\nBuild, baby, build\n\nPrior to Trump’s success in the November election, experts were doubting that America would see an increase in production. The Biden-Harris administration created a hostile regulatory environment for the oil and gas industry, but many of the rules impacted long-term investment on upstream investments, which is the exploration and production aspect of the industry furthest up the supply chain from the end consumers. The time lag involved meant that impacts on production were expected to be realized over the next few years.\n\nWhile the Trump administration wants to see oil prices down to $50 per barrel, some experts argue the industry isn’t likely to survive with prices that low. David Blackmon, an energy analyst who publishes his work on his “Energy Absurdities” Substack, told Just the News that $60 per barrel West Texas Intermediate, which is the American benchmark, is well below the break-even prices of most shale plays, which is the price producers need to be over in order to turn a profit.\n\n“My view has always been that we weren't going to have a big drilling boom in this second Trump presidency,” Blackmon said.\n\nBlackmon explained that the U.S. oil and gas industry, which has seen production rates explode as a result of hydraulic fracturing technologies, has matured over the last decade. The progression of oil development, he said, begins with an initial boom. Then, as companies drill out formations, they look to improve processes. “That’s the phase we’re in now,” he said.\n\nIf the price remains low for an extended period, Blackmon predicts, we’re likely to see layoffs in the oil and gas industry. With drilling rigs and frack crews idle, well-service industries will see the first impacts. However, the industry will likely look to further investment in infrastructure, such as pipelines, which will create some jobs in other sectors.\n\n“It’s what I call the ‘build, baby build’ phase,” Blackmon said.\n\nTrade deficits may worsen\n\nIn the wake of Trump’s tariff announcement, both Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, Reuters reported, have raised the risk of recession. If that happens, it would bring down demand for energy. Andy Fately, principal at FSX Hedge Consultants, argued on his “FX Poetry” Substack that we may be heading into a long-term period of low oil prices.\n\n“Remember, if energy prices decline, that reduces cost pressures for the entire economy. And here we are this morning with oil (-4.0%) breaking below $60/bbl and down -10% in the past month. Despite all the headlines that tariffs are going to raise prices, this is something that will clearly offset any general rise in price pressures,” Fately wrote.\n\nRobert Rapier, a chemical engineer and editor-in-chief of Shale Magazine, told Just the News that the economic playing field in the U.S. has changed and low energy prices won’t have an overall positive impact on the economy as they did 20 years ago.\n\n“Today we are a net exporter of oil and finished products. That means when oil prices go down, it actually worsens our trade deficit. We are getting less money now for our net exports. Trying to fix this with tariffs, if you drive oil prices down, you're going the wrong direction there,” Rapier said.\n\nHe said some industries will benefit. The airline industry, for example, will enjoy lower fuel costs, but overall he said the importance of the U.S. energy industry today will blunt the positive impacts.\n\n“And lower prices are not good for the energy industry,” Rapier said.\n\nUncertainty discourages investment\n\nThe oil and gas industry, he said, is experiencing a lot of uncertainty with Trump’s tariffs, which is going to discourage investment in drilling. “The oil industry is very conservative. They are already expressing concern about not knowing which direction these tariffs are going to go and how that's going to impact them,” Rapier said.\n\nOPEC, meanwhile, sees an opportunity in this low-price environment to potentially force some players out of the market and regain some of their share. In 2014, OPEC had a similar strategy when the U.S. shale industry produced an oil boom.\n\nRapier wrote about OPEC’s trade war with the U.S. in Forbes in 2016, a war the organization decidedly lost when the shale industry continued to grow. Things have changed, Rapier said. The shale plays are beginning to flatten out and the sweet spots with low break-even prices are getting exhausted. With the outlook poorer than in 2015, OPEC is thinking it could push some producers under by adding to an overburdened market, he said.\n\nShale producers unseating OPEC\n\n“Doomberg,” a top finance publication on Substack, had a different take on OPEC’s decision to increase production. The Doomberg analysts argued in “Punctuated Equilibrium” Monday that OPEC existed to keep oil prices higher. Its refusal to acknowledge the reality that shale producers unseated the cartel as the market steward has only hastened OPEC’s unseating. Its decision to flood the market was more of a surrender, the analysts argue, than a strategy to regain its control of the market.\n\nTrump had sought to lower oil prices, and the Doomberg analysts say he just might see $50 per barrel oil prices. Experts differ on how this will play out, and Trump’s policies could become a test of how much low energy costs help or hurt the economy."

        "full_text": "Follow live updates on the Trump administration here.\n\nElon Musk is known for many things. Subtlety is not one of them.\n\nWhen Musk shared a grainy two-minute video at 4:59 a.m. Monday to his 218 million followers, his post contained no words, and yet the message was clear. It showed the free-market intellectual Milton Friedman, in a 1980 clip well known to economists, waxing poetic about free trade as he sketched out the international origins of the parts that form a pencil.\n\nMusk was expressing his discomfort with President Trump’s imposition of draconian new tariffs. And yet one has to wonder what Musk hopes to accomplish.\n\nThis is not a president known to brook much public criticism, after all. Try to imagine Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, subtweeting her boss.\n\nAnd Musk repeatedly went out of his way to disagree with Trump over the weekend, suggesting he believes he is not subject to the same rules that govern others in the president’s inner circle.\n\nSpeaking by video on Saturday to an Italian far-right political conference, he said he hoped the United States and the European Union would “move to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone.”\n\nAnd that came after Musk twice took shots on X at the administration trade hawk Peter Navarro: First, he ridiculed Navarro’s Harvard Ph.D. in economics as “a bad thing, not a good thing,” suggesting it meant Navarro’s ego exceeded his intelligence.\n\nThen, in case anyone had not caught his drift, Musk arguably added a line to Navarro’s future obituary, saying he “ain’t built” anything, using an expletive for emphasis. (He later deleted the second insult.)\n\nI’ve been covering the notoriously impulsive Musk for a while now. I don’t see a cogent strategy at work in making public his frustrations with his boss.\n\nThis is not the first time Musk has been at odds with Trump since joining his team, and publicly so.\n\nDuring the transition, Musk endorsed Rick Scott of Florida to be the Senate majority leader, getting ahead of Trump, who did not support Scott. Then Musk endorsed Howard Lutnick for Treasury secretary, which Trump ignored in choosing Scott Bessent.\n\nMost prominently, Musk vocally defended the H-1B visa program against the more anti-immigrant, MAGA wing of the Republican Party, saying he would go to “war” to defend the program, which is beloved by the tech industry. Trump eventually sided with Musk.\n\nIn the early days of the Trump administration, Musk also dissed a Trump artificial-intelligence manufacturing plan. Trump gave him a pass for that one.\n\nSo does Musk have some secret plan here to get Trump to walk away from the ledge?\n\nTrump has espoused tariffs and protectionism for decades. Musk’s online acting-out suggests he believes Trump’s stance may be negotiable assuming enough pressure is applied.\n\nMEANWHILE on X\n\nHe protests the protesters too much\n\nMusk is using his X account as a megaphone. My colleague Kate Conger looks at how he is responding on the site to protests against his government cost-cutting efforts.\n\nOn Monday, Musk suggested in a series of posts that protesters had been paid to demonstrate against him, or had little idea about why they were protesting.\n\nIn one, he responded to a headline from his favorite right-wing satirical website that said the protesters were demanding government waste, writing “Seriously,” and adding a face-palm emoji. In another, he wrote that people protesting against him were full of “bitterness.”\n\nHe also shared posts from other X users claiming that the protests were staged, and asked, “Who are the key individuals funding this?”\n\nThe idea that someone is funding the opposition to him and his work has fascinated Musk in recent weeks. When protests cropped up at Tesla dealerships last month, he accused George Soros and other Democratic donors of funding them.\n\nThese responses are characteristic of Musk, who often interprets disagreement with him as an attack. They also violate one of the internet’s cardinal rules: Don’t feed the trolls. Where other billionaires might ignore the criticism, Musk can’t seem to stop himself from responding to it — and bringing it more attention.\n\n— Kate Conger\n\nyou shouldn’t miss\n\nHow Trump helped Musk save Twitter, financially\n\nWhen Musk bought Twitter for about $44 billion in 2022, he was said to have wildly overpaid for the beleaguered company. Musk agreed with the criticism, so much so that he tried to get out of the deal entirely.\n\nBut a funny thing happened. The company, now called X, has rebounded somewhat. And, as Kate Conger explains, that’s in large part because of Trump’s election, which she says had a “halo effect” on the company. The company still has problems, but Kate reports that Trump’s return to power has brought some advertisers back to the platform and made it newly relevant."

        "full_text": "6 hours ago\n\nYvette Tan, Annabelle Liang and Kelly Ng\n\nReporting from Singapore\n\nThe trade war between the world's two biggest economies shows no signs of slowing down - Beijing has vowed to \"fight to the end\" hours after US President Donald Trump threatened to nearly double the tariffs on China.\n\nThat could leave most Chinese imports facing a staggering 104% tax - a sharp escalation between the two sides.\n\nSmartphones, computers, lithium-ion batteries, toys and video game consoles make up the bulk of Chinese exports to the US. But there are so many other things, from screws to boilers.\n\nWith a deadline looming in Washington as Trump threatens to introduce the additional tariffs from Wednesday, who will blink first?\n\n\"It would be a mistake to think that China will back off and remove tariffs unilaterally,\" says Alfredo Montufar-Helu, a senior advisor to the China Center at The Conference Board think tank.\n\n\"Not only would it make China look weak, but it would also give leverage to the US to ask for more. We've now reached an impasse that will likely lead to long-term economic pain.\"\n\nLive updates on this story\n\nGlobal markets have slumped since last week when Trump's tariffs, which target almost every country, began coming into effect. Asian stocks, which saw their worst drop in decades on Monday after the Trump administration didn't waver, recovered slightly on Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, China has hit back with tit-for-tat levies - 34% - and Trump warned that he would retaliate with an additional 50% tariff if Beijing doesn't back down.\n\nUncertainty is high, with more tariffs, some more than 40%, set to kick in on Wednesday. Many of these would hit Asian economies: tariffs on China would rise to 54%, and those on Vietnam and Cambodia, would soar to 46% and 49% respectively.\n\nExperts are worried about the speed at which this is happening, leaving governments, businesses and investors little time to adjust or prepare for a remarkably different global economy.\n\nHow is China responding to the tariffs?\n\nChina had responded to the first round of Trump tariffs with tit-for-tat levies on certain US imports, export controls on rare metals and an anti-monopoly investigation into US firms, including Google.\n\nThis time too it has announced retaliatory tariffs, but it also appears to be bracing for pain with stronger measures. It has allowed its currency, the yuan, to weaken, which makes Chinese exports more attractive. And state-linked enterprises have been buying up stocks in what appears to be a move to stabilise the market.\n\nThe prospect of negotiations between the US and Japan seemed to buoy investors who were fighting to claw back some of the losses of recent days.\n\nBut the face-off between China and the US - the world's biggest exporter and its most important market - remains a major concern.\n\n\"What we are seeing is a game of who can bear more pain. We've stopped talking about any sense of gain,\" Mary Lovely, a US-China trade expert at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC, told the BBC's Newshour programme.\n\nDespite its slowing economy, China may \"very well be willing to endure the pain to avoid capitulating to what they believe is US aggression\", she added.\n\nShaken by a prolonged property market crisis and rising unemployment, Chinese people are just not spending enough. Indebted local governments have also been struggling to increase investments or expand the social safety net.\n\n\"The tariffs exacerbate this problem,\" said Andrew Collier, Senior Fellow at the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at Harvard Kennedy School.\n\nIf China's exports take a hit, that hurts a crucial revenue stream. Exports have long been a key factor in China's explosive growth. And they remain a significant driver, although the country is trying to diversify its economy with high-end tech manufacturing and greater domestic consumption.\n\nIt's hard to say exactly when the tariffs \"will bite but likely soon,\" Mr Collier says, adding that \"[President Xi] faces an increasingly difficult choice due to a slowing economy and dwindling resources\".\n\nIt goes both ways\n\nBut it's not just China that will be feeling the impact.\n\nAccording to the US Trade Representative office, the US imported $438bn (£342bn) worth of goods from China in 2024, with US exports to China valued at $143bn, leaving a trade deficit of $295bn.\n\nAnd it's not clear how the US is going to find alternative supply for Chinese goods on such short notice.\n\nTaxes on physical goods aside, both countries are \"economically intertwined in a lot of ways - there's a massive amount of investment both ways, a lot of digital trade and data flows\", says Deborah Elms, Head of Trade Policy at the Hinrich Foundation in Singapore.\n\n\"You can only tariff so much for so long. But there are other ways both countries can hit each other. So you might say it can't possibly get worse, but there are many ways in which it can.\"\n\nThe rest of the world is watching too, to see where Chinese exports shut out of the US market will go.\n\nThey will end up in other markets such as those in South East Asia, Ms Elms adds, and \"these places [are dealing] with their own tariffs and having to think about where else can we sell our products?\"\n\n\"So we are in a very different universe, one that is really murky.\"\n\nHow does this end?\n\nUnlike the trade war with China during Trump's first term, which was about negotiating with Beijing, \"it's unclear what is motivating these tariffs and it's very hard to predict where things might go from here,\" says Roland Rajah, lead economist at the Lowy Institute.\n\nChina has a \"wide toolkit\" for retaliation, he adds, such as depreciating their currency further or clamping down on US firms.\n\n\"I think the question is how restrained will they be? There's retaliation to save face and there's pulling out the whole arsenal. It's not clear if China wants to go down that path. It just might.\"\n\nSome experts believe the US and China may engage in private talks. Trump is yet to speak to Xi since returning to the White House, although Beijing has repeatedly signalled its willingness to talk.\n\nBut others are less hopeful.\n\n\"I think the US is overplaying its hand,\" Ms Elms says. She is sceptical of Trump's belief that the US market is so lucrative that China, or any country, will eventually bend.\n\n\"How will this end? No-one knows,\" she says. \"I'm really concerned about the speed and escalation. The future is much more challenging and the risks are just so high.\""

        "full_text": "House Republicans do not have enough votes to adopt changes the Senate made to a budget blueprint for enacting President Trump’s agenda, which the lower chamber is scheduled to vote on this week.\n\nThe House GOP cannot afford to lose more than three votes on the budget given the united Democratic opposition. More Republicans than that have already announced their opposition to the Senate changes, arguing the blueprint no longer ensures steep spending cuts.\n\n“From budget gimmicks to a pathetic $4 [billion] in spending cuts, the Senate’s budget resolution is a non-starter,” Rep. Andrew S. Clyde, Georgia Republican, posted on social media. “We need to be serious about delivering on President Trump’s America First agenda in a FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE manner. If this comes to the floor in its current form, I’m a NO.”\n\nMr. Clyde is a member of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus and some of the most vocal GOP opposition is coming from that group.\n\nFreedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris of Maryland and group members Reps. Chip Roy and Keith Self of Texas, Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma and Andy Ogles of Tennessee are among the Republicans who said they would vote against the Senate budget changes. Others have been critical but not been explicit about how they’d vote.\n\nThe House first adopted the budget blueprint in late February. It contained instructions for committees to follow in drafting the “one big, beautiful” reconciliation package that will carry the president’s agenda.\n\nRepublicans plan to load up that bill with sweeping tax and spending cuts, a debt-limit increase, energy policy, and funding for border security, immigration enforcement and defense.\n\nThe Senate this weekend voted 51-47 to alter the budget, adding instructions for its committees that are drastically different from those provided for House committees.\n\nHouse fiscal hawks are most upset that the Senate instructions set a collective spending cut floor of $4 billion over 10 years, a minuscule amount compared to the $1.5 trillion floor set in the House instructions.\n\nBoth chambers have set a goal of cutting at least $2 trillion, but the Senate instructions are all that is enforceable under the budget reconciliation rules. That’s why Senate Republicans opted for a low floor, to ensure maximum flexibility that they won’t fall short of a specific target and derail the entire bill.\n\nAll of the House Republicans who’ve announced their opposition did so after Mr. Trump endorsed the Senate changes and called for the GOP to unite around the budget. The president stepped up his public pressure campaign on Monday and is expected to make private appeals to win over the holdouts as well.\n\n“There is no better time than now to get this Deal DONE!” Mr. Trump posted on social media, urging the House to “quickly” adopt the budget.\n\nHe promised the House, the Senate and the administration would “work tirelessly” negotiating the bill that will follow and “everyone is going to be happy with the result.”\n\nMr. Norman said Mr. Trump will be meeting with some of the opponents but that may not change many minds.\n\n“We’ll hear him out, but I don’t see it,” he said, suggesting the president’s time would be better spent convincing Senate Republicans to raise their enforceable spending cut targets. “Now it’s time for him to pressure the Senate.”\n\nMr. Self said it’s not Mr. Trump’s word House Republicans distrust but the Senate’s.\n\n“There’s got to be a change in the numbers, because, frankly, the Senate is already pushing back against President Trump in many ways,” he said.\n\nSome of the opposition is coming from fiscal hawks outside of the Freedom Caucus.\n\n“I can’t vote for it,” Rep. Lloyd Smucker, Pennsylvania Republican and vice chair of the House Budget Committee, wrote on social media.\n\nHe and others have cited figures from the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget that the Senate’s instructions would allow for bills that could add up to $5.8 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, while only guaranteeing $4 billion in offsets.\n\nThe lack of enforceable spending cuts in the Senate’s blueprint has House Republicans worried about the path ahead.\n\nMr. Harris said he is “unconvinced” the Senate will be able to deliver the $2 trillion in cuts Republicans are seeking.\n\n“The Senate is free to put pen to paper to draft its reconciliation bill, but I can’t support House passage of the Senate changes to our budget resolution until I see the actual spending and deficit reduction plans to enact President Trump’s America First agenda,” he said.\n\nMr. Harris’ suggestion is in line with an idea some opponents of the Senate changes have been floating: Let the budget sit for now while the House and Senate work on the details of the reconciliation bill.\n\nOnce the two chambers have identified an acceptable level of spending cuts, then the House can adopt the budget resolution, which is needed to unlock the next step, the filibuster-proof reconciliation bill.\n\n“Let’s see the language that the Senate’s going to put forward,” Mr. Roy said. “We don’t need to get the budget done this week. Let’s go look and see what the actual reconciliation product will look like. And then maybe we can decide to pass the budget and the reconciliation [bill], boom, boom.”\n\nSome Republicans have also raised concerns about the Senate’s method for calculating the cost of the tax cuts in the bill.\n\nThe Senate is going to use a “current policy” baseline that will not count the cost of extending tax cuts already in law — namely the individual and small business tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that are set to expire this year.\n\nRepublicans are planning to permanently extend those tax cuts from Mr. Trump’s first term and the current policy baseline allows them to discount the roughly $4 trillion cost of doing so."

        "full_text": "China’s government says it will “fight to the end” if the US continues to escalate the trade war, after Donald Trump threatened huge additional tariffs in response to China’s retaliatory measures.\n\nOn Tuesday, China’s commerce ministry accused the US of “blackmail” and said the US president’s threats of additional 50% tariffs if Beijing did not reverse its own 34% reciprocal tariff were a “mistake on top of a mistake”.\n\nIt vowed to “resolutely take countermeasures”, adding: “China will fight to the end if the US side is bent on going down the wrong path.”\n\nOn Tuesday Asian markets appeared to improve slightly in early trading, a day after torrid day on the global markets that prompted the billionaire investor Bill Ackman, one of the US president’s backers in the 2024 race for the White House, to call for a moratorium.\n\nTuesday’s response from Beijing is the latest in a worsening tit-for-tat between the two countries. Last week Trump announced a swathe of tariffs ranging from 10%-50% against US trading partners to come into effect this Wednesday. He placed a 34% tariff on imports from China – in addition to a previous 20% levy. Beijing then retaliated with a reciprocal 34% tariff on all US imports. That prompted Trump on Monday to threaten an additional 50% tariff on to Chinese imports if Beijing did not reverse theirs.\n\n“If China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose additional tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!”\n\nA scathing editorial in Chinese official state news outlet Xinhua accused Trump of “naked extortion”.\n\n“Utterly absurd is the underlying logic of the United States: ‘I can hit you at my will, and you must not respond. Instead, you must surrender unconditionally’,” it said. “This is not diplomacy. It is blunt coercion dressed up as policy.”\n\nOn social media a 1987 speech by then US president Ronald Reagan posted by China’s foreign ministry has been widely shared. The video clip, in which Reagan criticises the use of tariffs as leading to retaliation and ultimately hurting the US economy, “has a new meaning in 2025”, China’s The Paper said.\n\nWen-ti Sung, a non-resident fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub said the US and China were “locked in a game of chicken”. “Like two race cars driving directly toward each other, whoever swerves first will stand to lose prestige and profit,” Sung told the Guardian.\n\n“China seems determined to signal that the world is still bipolar, and that Beijing will not let Washington get to call the shots, lest it sets the tone for the years to come. Plus China is still waiting to get more assurance from Trump that if it accommodates Trump’s demand will it get China out of his crosshairs or whether it will only whet his appetite more.\n\n“If not, China’s main option is to respond with proportional retaliatory trade sanctions against the US, while trying to negotiate with Washington at the same time.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Japan’s Nikkei index rose 6%, rebounding from an 18-month low on Monday, after Trump and Japanese prime minister Shigeru Ishiba agreed to open trade talks in a phone call late on Monday.\n\nChinese blue-chips climbed 0.7%, recouping a fraction of the more than 7% slide on Monday. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index jumped 2% after suffering the worst day since 1997. US stock futures also pointed higher after a rollercoaster session in which it touched its lowest level in more than a year.\n\nTrump’s “liberation day” tariffs targeted dozens of countries, and China is not the only one to respond. The European Commission has proposed counter-tariffs of 25% on a range of US goods, including soybeans, nuts and sausages, while saying they stood ready to negotiate a “zero for zero” deal with Trump.\n\nEU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic said at a news conference: “Sooner or later, we will sit at the negotiation table with the US and find a mutually acceptable compromise.”\n\nThe 27-member EU, which had already been hit with tariffs on vehicles and metals, faces another 20% on other items from Wednesday. Trump has also threatened to impose tariffs on alcoholic drinks from the bloc.\n\nTaiwan, which faces a 32% reciprocal tariff and saw its worst ever market fall on Monday, has said it is ready to negotiate “at any time”, with president Lai Ching-te proposing a zero-tariffs agreement, removal of trade barriers, and increased investment in the US.\n\nTaiwan has repeatedly said its large trade surplus with the US is due to the US’s soaring demand for tech, given its companies are major suppliers to companies such as Apple and Nvidia."

        "full_text": "Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino.\n\nOn the first day of his administration, President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing the federal government to no longer consider a person’s gender and to recognize people as either male or female, as defined by the size of their reproductive cells.\n\nThe directive served as a basis for a series of subsequent orders that called for defunding medical or educational institutions that have protections for transgender students, provide gender-affirming medical care to transgender youth or allow transgender girls or women to participate in women’s sports. Another order attempted to ban transgender people from the military.\n\nBut some of those orders — and Trump’s later comments — lack context or include incorrect or misleading statements.\n\n“For four long years, we had an administration that tried to abolish the very concept of womanhood and replace it with radical gender ideology,” Trump said on March 26 at a Woman’s History Month event at the White House.\n\n“No matter how many surgeries you have or chemicals you inject, if you’re born with male DNA in every cell of your body,” he continued, presumably referring to the presence of a Y chromosome, “you can never become a woman — you’re not going to be a woman. And that’s why last month, I proudly signed a historic executive order to ban men from competing in women’s sports. … I also banned puberty blockers — can you believe I’m even saying this — and the sexual mutilation of minor youth.”\n\nTrump’s first transgender-related order declared that people are either male or female at “conception.” But scientists say that excludes certain people and sex is not fully determined at conception.\n\nHis executive order targeting gender-affirming medical treatments for trans youth — which is not a ban — claimed that health care providers are “maiming and sterilizing” children and referred to gender-affirming care as “chemical and surgical mutilation.” That language is misleading and wrong. Gender-affirming care is supported by professional medical associations under specific guidance, and surgeries typically take place after age 18. Gender-affirming care is associated with improved mental health, and some medical interventions are reversible.\n\nTrump’s policies were followed by a series of lawsuits across the country. Federal judges have already blocked some orders from taking effect while the cases move through the courts, or questioned the administration’s plans. Two separate restraining orders and a preliminary temporary injunction have been issued to prevent the government from withholding or conditioning funding for medical institutions providing gender-affirming care.\n\nA transgender person identifies with a gender that does not match their sex assigned at birth. Nearly 1.6 million people over the age of 13, or about 0.5% of the U.S. population, identify as transgender, according to a 2022 report by the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law’s Williams Institute.\n\nWe reached out to the White House to ask for support for some of the statements in the executive orders, but we didn’t get a response.\n\n‘Two Sexes, Male and Female’\n\nIn an order titled “defending women from gender ideology extremism,” signed by Trump on his first day in office, the administration declared that the U.S. will now officially only “recognize two sexes, male and female,” on all federal documents, statements, regulations, forms, communications or other messages. The order also called for banning transgender women, who are referred to as “men,” from “intimate single-sex spaces,” such as bathrooms, single-sex shelters, women’s prisons and sports.\n\nSex, the order dictated, should be understood as a person’s “immutable biological classification as either male or female,” and not as “a synonym for” gender. The order specifically directs agencies and federal employees acting in an official capacity to “use the term ‘sex’ and not ‘gender'” — yet Trump himself regularly conflates the terms, including in his inaugural address and his March 4 address to Congress.\n\nAlthough one of the order’s stated purposes is to restore “biological truth,” it used a limited definition of how sex is understood by scientists, declaring that female means a person who “at conception” belongs “to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell” and male is someone who “at conception” belongs “to the sex that produces the small reproductive cell.”\n\nScientists told us that although biological sex can be defined by the size of a person’s reproductive cells, or gametes, that definition doesn’t always work given there are multiple factors that define sex in humans.\n\n“Sex is a catch-all phrase that actually refers to a constellation of features, not just one as they’ve defined it here,” Margaret M. McCarthy, a neuroscientist and pharmacology professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, told us.\n\nSex definitions typically refer to a construct based on genetic, physiological and anatomic traits. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, referencing the American Psychological Association, has defined sex as a person’s “biological status as male, female, or something else,” which is “assigned at birth and associated with physical attributes, such as anatomy and chromosomes.” A 2022 consensus study report by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine defined it as “a multidimensional construct based on a cluster of anatomical and physiological traits that include external genitalia, secondary sex characteristics, gonads, chromosomes, and hormones.”\n\nIn most cases, all facets of sexual development are congruent, McCarthy, who has studied sex differentiation for decades, told us. Typically, she said, an X and Y chromosome will lead to the development of testes, the production of testosterone, the development of a penis and the production of sperm. And typically, two X chromosomes will lead to ovaries, the production of estrogen and progesterone, the development of a uterus and a vagina, and the production of eggs.\n\nBut this is not always the case. According to the Pediatric Endocrine Society, about 1 in 4,500 people each year are born in the U.S. with a collection of medical conditions known as Differences of Sex Development that interfere with the typical male or female sex development described above. The definition in the executive order “should not and cannot apply” to people with a DSD, according to a statement from the organization. That’s because some people with a DSD, which is also called intersex, don’t produce sperm or eggs, produce both of them, or produce a reproductive cell that doesn’t match their biological sex development.\n\n“Some people may have genitals that look typical for a male – with a penis – but have XX (‘female’) chromosomes and female body parts – a uterus and ovaries – due to medical conditions that affect the hormones. On the other hand, some people may have genitals that look typical for a female – with a vagina and no penis – but have XY (‘male’) chromosomes and testes on the inside of their bodies,” the statement reads.\n\nOther professional and advocacy organizations, such as the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and interACT, which advocates for intersex people, have also said the definitions in Trump’s executive order are not accurate and exclude intersex people.\n\nIn addition, the inclusion of “at conception” in the executive order’s definition of female and male is “technically incorrect,” McCarthy said. (The Department of Health and Human Services’ definitions, created in response to the order, do not include that language.)\n\nSexual differentiation is not complete when the sperm fertilizes the egg, or at conception, as the order may suggest — it occurs progressively during gestation and beyond. “The only thing that’s happened at conception is a transfer of an X or a Y chromosome to the ova. The gonads haven’t differentiated yet,” McCarthy explained, referring to the glands that could eventually produce reproductive cells.\n\nExperts also objected to the administration’s description and erasure of gender and gender identity. Gender identity, the order declared, can’t be used as “a meaningful basis for identification” and reflects a “fully internal and subjective sense of self” that’s “disconnected from biological reality and sex.”\n\n“A person’s gender is associated with but cannot be reduced to either sex assigned at birth or specific sex traits,” the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine report says.\n\nThe CDC has defined gender as “cultural roles, behaviors, activities, and attributes expected of people based on their sex” and gender identity as a “person’s inner sense of being a boy/man/male, girl/woman/female, another gender, or no gender,” which comes about “as a result of a combination of inherent and extrinsic or environmental factors.”\n\n“Nobody thinks that [gender] identity is ‘disconnected from biological reality,’” Anne Fausto Sterling, a professor emerita of biology at Brown University who is an expert in gender development, told us, adding that most scholars think it is “inborn and thus must have a biological origin.”\n\nFinally, McCarthy said, the definitions in the executive order are not practical either. In our daily lives, when interacting with people, doing research or filling out a form, people are usually asked to self-identify. “You ask a person, are you male or female? You don’t say, show me your gametes or what size are your gametes,” she said. Sex assigned at birth, which ends up on birth certificates and passports, isn’t based on gamete size or “the biological function of their reproductive system,” as HHS guidelines recommend either, she said — it is typically assigned by doctors based on external genitalia.\n\nMedical Gender Transition Treatments\n\nIn a separate executive order issued on Feb. 28, Trump directed the federal government to take a series of actions to no longer “fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support” gender-affirming care for people under 19. The order used misleading language to refer to treatments that are supported by professional medical associations under specific guidance, and were previously considered beneficial by the federal government.\n\n“Across the country today, medical professionals are maiming and sterilizing a growing number of impressionable children under the radical and false claim that adults can change a child’s sex through a series of irreversible medical interventions,” the order said. It later defined children as “individuals under 19 years of age.”\n\nBut experts have told us that gender-affirming surgeries typically take place after age 18, the legal age of adulthood in most states, and after a case-by-case assessment by a medical team.\n\nThe majority of transgender children do not receive any medical treatments to transition. Instead, they may change their name, pronouns, or hair and dress as part of a social transition. When medical treatments do occur, they’re rarely surgical and begin during adolescence or after, as we’ve explained. Families with a child who identifies with a gender that doesn’t match their sex assigned at birth are offered counseling.\n\nGuidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Endocrine Society and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health recommends care at different ages. Puberty blockers, or medications that delay the beginning of puberty, are the first medical intervention and are typically offered between ages 8 to 13 for girls and 9 to 14 for boys. Gender-affirming hormone therapy is typically offered around age 16, when adolescents are capable of making an informed decision that weighs the potential risks and benefits.\n\nTrump’s executive order referred to gender-affirming care as “chemical and surgical mutilation” and said it does “blatant harm” to children. “Countless children soon regret that they have been mutilated,” it continued. The order directed the attorney general to enforce laws against female genital mutilation, or cutting, which is illegal in the U.S. and other countries and refers to a cultural practice of removing or injuring female genitalia for no medical reason. The order also called for “ending reliance on junk science,” directing agencies to stop using guidance from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization and UNICEF, female genital mutilation has no health benefits and can lead to serious complications. It is considered a human rights violation. Practiced primarily in Africa and the Middle East, FGM is mostly performed on girls under 15 by people who are not health care providers. Gender-affirming surgery is always carried out in a medical setting, is consensual and is rarely performed on minors.\n\n“[T]he Executive Order promotes misinformation, including that large shares of youth are seeking gender affirming medical care, which is not the case, that regret rates among those who do seek care are high, when regret rates are very low, and erroneously conflating ‘female genital mutilation’ and gender-affirming care,” Lindsey Dawson, associate director of HIV Policy and director of LGBTQ Health Policy at KFF, a health policy research organization, said in a report about the order.\n\nIn a cross-sectional study among insured people in the U.S., Harvard researchers and colleagues found that in 2019 there were no gender-affirming surgical procedures in transgender and gender diverse, or TGD, minors under 12 years of age — and that those in minors older than 12 “were rare and almost entirely chest-related.” Based on those findings, the researchers wrote, “concerns around high rates of gender-affirming surgery use, specifically among TGD minors, may be unwarranted.”\n\nA separate study by some of the same Harvard researchers, published in JAMA Pediatrics in January, used insurance claims data and found that less than 0.1% of minors ages 8 to 17 with private insurance are transgender or gender diverse and received puberty blockers or hormones between 2018 and 2022. No child under 12 years of age received a hormone prescription.\n\n“There’s not some massive wave of folks accessing care,” Landon D. Hughes, co-author of both Harvard studies and a fellow at Harvard University’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told NBC News earlier this year.\n\nStudies suggest that gender-affirming care can improve the well-being and mental health of transgender youth, who have an increased risk of depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. While some of these findings have been criticized, there isn’t good evidence that gender-affirming care is harmful, as Trump’s executive order claimed.\n\n“Although President Trump’s executive order describes gender-affirming care as ‘junk science,’ access to gender-affirming care for transgender youth is supported by a consensus of major medical associations in the U.S.,” Elana Redfield, federal policy director at the Williams Institute at UCLA’s School of Law, said in a brief following the order. “The order does not acknowledge any benefits of gender-affirming care, instead making unsubstantiated statements of widespread harm and disregarding decades of science that form the foundation of the services that are currently available to transgender youth.”\n\nNot All ‘Irreversible’\n\nIt’s important to note that not all medical gender-affirming interventions are “irreversible” nor do they make it impossible for someone to “conceive children of their own,” as the executive order said.\n\nAs guidance from the AAP explains, only gender-affirming surgeries are fully irreversible and not all of them affect fertility. The effects of medications that suppress puberty are reversible, but the AAP notes that their impact on fertility is unknown and that fertility could be impacted if followed by the use of sex hormones.\n\nThe changes brought by gender-affirming hormone therapy can be reversed if hormones are stopped before these changes are fully developed, but they become irreversible after that happens, potentially impacting fertility, according to the guidance.\n\nThe guidance sets a number of steps and criteria to make sure that individuals offered gender-affirming care are not what the executive order refers to as “impressionable children.” A multidisciplinary team of medical and mental health providers should screen, assess and monitor patients and make sure they are capable of fully understanding the risks and benefits of each intervention and discuss, when applicable, options to preserve fertility.\n\nThere is very little reliable data on how often transgender people regret going through gender-affirming interventions or opt to “detransition.” Many studies have a short follow-up period and rely on patients reporting back to providers.\n\nBut the scientific literature doesn’t support the notion that “[c]ountless children soon regret that they have been mutilated,” as the order said.\n\nAs PolitiFact has reported, recent studies of medical gender-affirming interventions in adolescents show that rates of young people stopping or regretting treatment or detransitioning range from 1% to 9%, with most on the lower end.\n\nA study by Princeton University researchers published in 2024 in JAMA Pediatrics that looked at the experiences of 220 young people using puberty blockers or hormones found that nine of them regretted the interventions, with four of them stopping treatment.\n\nAnother study looking at the outcomes of 1,089 young people who were assessed by the National Health Service Gender Identity Development Service in England from 2008 to 2021 found that 5.3% stopped treatment with puberty blockers or gender-affirming hormones and reverted to identifying with their birth gender.\n\nAs scientists have explained, people detransition for multiple reasons and not all people who stop treatment regret that care. Some stop due to undesired side effects of hormones or of transitioning, such as discrimination, and some stop when they’ve reached the results they wanted. Similarly, a person who regrets transitioning may still consider themselves transgender, and someone who stops identifying as transgender may not regret gender-affirming care.\n\nRegret rates are typically even lower in adults, and studies show adults regret other plastic surgeries more often than gender-affirming surgery.\n\nCorrection, April 8: We misquoted a Pediatric Endocrine Society statement and incorrectly said that 4,500 people in the U.S. are born with a Difference of Sex Development every year. The correct statistic is 1 in 4,500 people."

        "full_text": "Not to say I told you so. But let’s be real — I’m fully and completely, unashamedly, absolutely saying I told you so. And the Supreme Court of the United States just backed me up. Again.\n\nToday, in a one-two punch of constitutionally glorious vindication, the highest court in the land handed President Donald J. Trump a 2-0 win, one of which should have every America-hating, Constitution-twisting, open-borders cheerleader choking on their avocado toast. Because, yes, SCOTUS just greenlit Trump’s use of a 1798 law to deport foreign gang members. You know — those charming fellas who rape, murder, and traffic women and fentanyl with equal zeal, all while wearing face tattoos and flashing signs like it’s a Netflix audition for Narcos: The Spin-Off No One Wanted.\n\nBut for those keeping score at home, let’s talk about who got it wrong — and got smacked for it like a two-dollar pig at the state fair.\n\nJudge James Boasberg, the D.C. District Court’s very own champion of anti-Trump jurisprudence, had previously blocked Trump’s efforts to use the Alien Enemies Act — a law written by John Adams himself — claiming it didn’t apply to non-state actors like criminal cartels or foreign gangs.\n\nTo which SCOTUS just said, in effect: Wrong, Jim. Now go sit in the corner and think about what you've done.\n\nLet’s be crystal clear: this isn’t just a Trump win. This is a national security win. This is a common sense win. And this is a Kevin McCullough was right and has receipts win.\n\n“The president was never out of bounds,” I wrote in Townhall.com back in 2020. “He’s acting in the national interest, the legal framework exists, and his critics will eat their words when the courts catch up.”\n\nCheckmate.\n\nSCOTUS ruled that the 1798 Alien Enemies Act — still on the books, still valid, and, as it turns out, still potent — gives the president broad discretion in times of conflict to remove foreign nationals deemed dangerous to public safety. Boasberg tried to twist the language, pretending the Founders couldn’t have imagined a world where non-state actors like MS-13 or Hezbollah proxies could wage war on American streets.\n\nBut here’s the thing: the Founders weren’t stupid. And neither is Trump.\n\n“The idea that the Founders didn’t anticipate foreign threats morphing and adapting is both historically illiterate and strategically suicidal,” I wrote when the lower courts first tried to kneecap Trump on this front. “These laws weren’t written for 1798 problems. They were written with timeless principles.”\n\nAnd wouldn’t you know it, seven of the nine Supreme Court justices apparently agree. Including some who are about as cuddly toward Trump as CNN is to reality.\n\nThe majority opinion emphasized that the statute “applies to all enemies, state or non-state, in times of conflict, and grants the executive discretion.” Boom. Mic drop. Go home, leftists.\n\nBut it wasn’t just the gang member deportation case that got a SCOTUS smackdown in Trump’s favor today. In a separate decision, the justices also rebuked another lower court ruling trying to jam up Trump’s immigration policy — one that had made it easier to quickly deport criminal aliens without a years-long taxpayer-funded legal carnival.\n\nSo that’s two wins. On the same day. From the same court. For the same president.\n\nAnd yet, the legacy media is doing Olympic-level gymnastics trying to bury the lead. But don’t worry. We see you.\n\nWhat makes this even juicier is the context. Remember how Democrats clutched their pearls, insisting that Trump was some kind of dictator for using every legal tool available to him? Remember how they screamed that he was trampling the Constitution by enforcing the law — as written — to remove violent criminals who shouldn’t have been here in the first place?\n\nTurns out, he was following the law to the letter. The same law, by the way, that Abraham Lincoln invoked during the Civil War and that FDR used during World War II. And you know what Lincoln, FDR, and Trump all have in common? They used executive authority for the protection of the American people. Period.\n\nSo to all the critics who claimed this was racist, xenophobic, or unconstitutional — congrats on your L.\n\n“You don’t get to scream ‘democracy!’ while simultaneously ignoring the plain meaning of law and precedent,” I wrote in 2021. “Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act isn’t a loophole — it’s leadership.”\n\nWell, well, well. Here we are.\n\nThis case, Garland v. Gonzalez, didn’t just restore the president’s rightful authority. It also restored a little faith in the idea that our institutions aren’t entirely broken. When even a SCOTUS that includes Ketanji Brown Jackson and Elena Kagan can’t deny the plain text of the law, you know the Trump legal case was airtight.\n\nAnd maybe — just maybe — it’s time to stop trying to handicap the commander-in-chief when he’s trying to do his job.\n\nImagine how many lives could’ve been saved — how much violence prevented — if Trump’s policies had been allowed to take effect in real time instead of being tied up in courtroom kabuki theater by activist judges and Soros-backed NGOs.\n\nThis is why elections matter. This is why the courts matter. And this is why Donald Trump, whether you love him, fear him, or tweet about him from your therapist’s office, was right.\n\nAgain.\n\nSCOTUS didn’t just rule in Trump’s favor today. They ruled in America’s favor. They upheld the rule of law, the original intent of the Constitution, and the principle that no foreign gang member has the right to remain in the country they seek to destroy.\n\nI told you so.\n\nI warned you.\n\nAnd now the Supreme Court just underlined it, bolded it, and stapled it to your forehead.\n\nSCOTUS: TRUMP WAS RIGHT!\n\nLet the crying commence."

        "full_text": "Newsmax's stock broke records for initial public offerings in its first week of trading, becoming the first Regulation A+ offering to go directly to the NYSE's Big Board – while captivating the markets with a dizzying valuation.\n\nAfter trading began Monday just before 11 a.m. ET, Newsmax (NMAX) soon found itself with a share price of $44.30 and a market capitalization of $4.18 billion.\n\nThe New York Times marveled that Newsmax's spectacular rise briefly put it at a richer valuation than U.S. Steel.\n\nDriving the surge, the Times noted, is Newsmax's \"reliably conservative programming, with anchors including Greg Kelly, a former Fox News host, and Michael Savage\" — and the media outlet's airing on \"most major cable and satellite providers, including DirecTV, Dish, Comcast, Charter and Verizon.\"\n\n\"Newsmax Stock Skyrockets in Roaring Market Debut,\" splashed The Wall Street Journal headline, noting that on its first day, \"trading was halted multiple times due to volatility.\"\n\n\"The Newsmax IPO was one for the record books\" and \"Newsmax made history,\" reported MarketWatch, which once called Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy \"the right's great online ally.\"\n\n\"Data from FactSet show the second-day performance of Newsmax, when it surged 179%, was one of the strongest ever for a new listing,\" MarketWatch said.\n\nNMAX \"soared spectacularly … skyrocketed,\" Barron's said, likening the stock's meteoric rise to the dot-com internet mania of the turn of the 21st century — as well as to \"the fervor surrounding the March 2024 Wall Street debut of Trump Media & Technology Group, the company that runs the Truth Social site and app.\"\n\nNewsmax got some strong moral support from Britain's Financial Times (FT), which reported that it had not only a credible business model, but was savvy in seeking profits from legacy cable and the emerging streaming market.\n\nThe FT sees Newsmax's rise paralleling the rise of President Donald Trump, whose own prospects have long been discounted by the major media.\n\nBut the FT sees Newsmax as \"one of the most interesting entrepreneurial bets of the Trump era.\"\n\nThe secret of its success?\n\n\"Billionaire founder Christopher Ruddy is simply wagering that even a dying industry can support a new entrant, if it produces content people want,\" the FT stated.\n\nImportantly, CNBC reported, \"Traditional media IPOs are hard to come by — especially given the significant changes to companies' business models in recent years, and Newsmax's meteoric debut was unexpected.\"\n\nCNBC went on to quote Ruddy's \"Squawk Box\" TV appearance when he explained the public's immense thirst for Newsmax's conservative content across multiple access points.\n\n\"Americans for a long time have been voting with their remote controls, downloads, apps, to say they want Newsmax,\" Ruddy told CNBC. \"Now investors powerfully are buying Newsmax shares because they like us, they value us, and they want us to keep growing.\"\n\nNewsmax is the fourth-most watched cable news channel after Fox News, MSNBC, and CNN, according to Nielsen.\n\nRuddy said Newsmax has both Republican and Democrat viewers and contributors: \"We believe we're conservative with an independent news mission, and we ask tough questions of the Trump administration.\"\n\nJonathan Miller, a former News Corp executive who is now CEO of Integrated Media, said, \"This shows there continues to be financial support for all things MAGA. There is room for a multiplicity of voices on the right in a way we haven't seen emerge on the left.\"\n\nBucking the Market Collapse\n\nNot only did NMAX surge, but it did so as Trump unveiled his reciprocal tariffs, wiping out over $5 trillion in market value in the S&P 500 in the first two days. During its IPO debut week, Newsmax was only one of a handful of stocks in the green amid a sea of red.\n\nAfter Day 2 on the NYSE, Newsmax's market capitalization at $32 billion was higher than those of 235 companies in the S&P 500 benchmark index.\n\nRecord Ratings\n\nOn Monday, Newsmax reported significant audience growth in the first quarter of 2025, with total viewership reaching 33.6 million — an eye-popping 50% increase from 22.4 million in Q1 2024, as Nielsen reported.\n\nNewsmax also achieved a 15% quarter-over-quarter growth from Q4 2024's 29.3 million viewers.\n\nAs Jason Villar, Newsmax Vice President of Media and Market Research, put it: \"These strong surges in audiences rarely happen in cable news. We are clearly bucking the trend of cable news and overall cable viewership, as viewers clearly like the product Newsmax is offering.\"\n\nMore Info on Newsmax Shares"

        "full_text": "Recently, Newsom has undergone cosmetic surgery for his brand. Newsom spent years presenting himself as one of the faces of the progressive movement, but President Donald Trump’s dispatching of fellow Golden State liberal Kamala Harris persuaded Newsom that to act on his well-established ambitions in 2028, he would need to ditch the unpopular agenda that doomed Harris.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden governed to the left of where he had run in 2020, when Harris had run to his left. In 2024, the country roundly rejected the Biden-Harris legacy, and Newsom, with his finger perpetually suspended in the air to discern the direction of the wind, quite rightly sensed that to make it out of the wilderness, he would have to recalibrate.\n\nThe theory is sound, but Newsom’s Kinsley gaffe, or mistaken telling of the truth, was to articulate it so ham-handedly.\n\nIn February, Newsom announced the launch of a podcast, This Is Gavin Newsom. It was a fine idea that could have conceivably helped him build the kind of personal relationship with voters that Trump did on the alternative media circuit last year.\n\n“We need to change the conversation,” Newsom asserted. “I’m going to be talking directly with people I disagree with.” And sure enough, right-wing firebrands Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon were among his first guests on the program.\n\nPromises made, promises kept? Not so fast. While the voice interviewing Kirk and Bannon sounded like Newsom’s, the ideas it articulated did not.\n\nAbout transgender athletes, Newsom told Kirk, “I think it’s an issue of fairness, I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness — it’s deeply unfair,” before going on to laud the Trump campaign for nailing Harris over her past support for taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries for illegal immigrants.\n\n“She didn’t even react to it, which was even more devastating,” he mused. “Then you had the video [of Harris] as a validator. Brutal.”\n\n“Not one person ever in my office has ever used the word ‘Latinx,’” Newsom boasted in another attempt to Sister Souljah the far reaches of his coalition, this time over what he called an “out-of-touch fixation.”\n\n“Where did that even — I just didn’t even know where it came from,” he continued.\n\nThe Bannon episode, meanwhile, featured quite a lot of good-natured banter with and praise for the former Trump adviser, who once bragged about running a “platform for the alt-right.”\n\n“Steve, I really enjoyed this conversation,” Newsom told Bannon at its conclusion. “I think it’s incredibly valuable, and I appreciate the spirit to which we were able to engage. And I hope we can continue the conversation.”\n\n“I appreciate your advocacy. I also appreciate that you call balls and strikes,” he added.\n\nIn a subsequent episode with former Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, Newsom lovingly compared Bannon to his own grandfather.\n\nStill, nearly four years out from the next presidential election, the California governor has created three huge headaches for himself that are sure to imperil his chances of prevailing in it.\n\nFirst, there is the inexorable discomfort at the sight of the post-surgery patient on whom the “after” bears no resemblance at all to the “before.”\n\nNewsom may now wish to present as a Blue Dog, a working-class champion with neither the time for nor any interest in the far Left’s social agenda, but such an image is entirely inconsistent with the one he’s cultivated throughout his decadeslong climb to the top in California.\n\nAn early advocate of gay marriage, marijuana legalization, and other relatively popular early-21st-century progressive causes, Newsom championed the less popular ones with equal vigor until the moment he deemed them politically disadvantageous.\n\nConsider, for example, that in 2014, Newsom celebrated the passage of the California law that first allowed biological males to participate in women’s sports; that in 2021, he offered a haughty, implicit rebuke of those on the side of sanity (the state wasn’t “going backwards on these issues”); and that in 2022, he condemned other states for “passing laws to demonize the transgender community, especially transgender youth.”\n\n“The hate demonstrated by these laws is unfathomable,” Newsom said at the time.\n\nThe athletics issue is just the tip of the iceberg. Last year, Newsom signed a bill into law to conceal from parents when their own children socially transition at school. And while aghast at Harris’s support for the provision of gender transition treatments for illegal immigrants, he has previously taken action to provide the same for both illegal immigrants and Californian inmates.\n\nAs for the “out-of-touch” Latinx “fixation,” Newsom suffered from just such a condition for years.\n\n“I hope we can really paint a picture in terms of our consciousness of how impactful this has been on the Latinx community,” Newsom said during an August 2020 COVID-19 briefing.\n\nThen, in 2023, Newsom attacked Republicans for coming to the same conclusion he did a couple of years later.\n\n“You’ve got politicians that are banning not assault rifles but the word ‘Latinx,’” the then-indignant Newsom raged. “They’re not even serious.”\n\nThe governor is right to intuit that this past iteration of himself would not fare well in a general election. Americans have moved past the lies told by elites such as Newsom in pursuit of power. But there’s no reason for them to believe that he’s renouncing them now for any reason other than that there’s power to be attained by doing so.\n\nSecond, he has now done irreparable damage to his standing with the ascendant left wing of his party.\n\nThis presents an enormous practical problem for Newsom, who will have to win a Democratic primary in which none of the truths he now feels can be said will be popular before he can benefit from his tack to the center.\n\nRemember that while Biden eventually triumphed over his more progressive competition in the 2020 primary contest, there was a moment when self-professed socialist Bernie Sanders appeared poised to become the party’s new standard-bearer. It was only the COVID-19 crisis and the collective decision of the also-rans all suddenly to throw their weight behind Biden that prevented such an eventuality.\n\nMoreover, there’s a reason that Biden more closely resembled Sanders than the version of himself who ran for president in, say, 2008, once he took the oath of office. The activist wing of the party with the most pull in academia, Hollywood, and the media demanded it.\n\nAfter all, central to these elite Democrats’ self-conception is the idea that they are constantly pushing the country forward, one novel, righteous idea at a time. For that reason, they’re unlikely to take well to one of their own suddenly breaking off from their ranks to undermine the premises upon which some of their most closely held ideas (radical gender theory) and the language they’ve created to communicate them (Latinx) are built.\n\nMoreover, while it’s true that some historically Democratic constituencies, including Latino and black people, might resent these ideas, those demographics are already moving to the right as the party increasingly becomes reliant on well-to-do, college-educated white people living in major cities and their suburbs. In other words, the exact group most wedded to the social program Newsom has turned his back on.\n\nCertainly, Newsom could have pivoted to the center in a way that wouldn’t have been so confrontational, or even offensive, to his own primary voters. But that’s not the path he’s chosen. Instead, he chose to mock that which he had once preached — and alongside the enemy, no less.\n\nPolling shows that a plurality of Democrats, who stand to the right of Democratic primary voters, believe the party ought to moderate. But a much larger majority, 81%, of this more moderate group believe the party should be “more combative against Donald Trump than they are now.” Can Newsom not anticipate the devastating impact that the clips of him chumming it up with Kirk and Bannon will have a couple of years from now?\n\nThird, Newsom’s rebrand plays directly into his core weakness as a candidate.\n\nThere’s no disputing that Newsom is a smooth operator with a talent for repartee. As a career politician who has long had his eye on the Oval Office, Newsom walks into interviews, debates, and other events not just prepared but eager to bite, kick, scratch, and claw to defend himself. He’s rarely caught flat-footed, even, and perhaps especially, when he’s at a disadvantage — as he was when his state’s dismal condition was compared with Florida’s exemplary one during a Fox News debate with Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2023.\n\nThe drawback to this indisputable strength is that Newsom’s polish, in conjunction with his poor record, gives voters the impression that he’s a slick, craven salesman better equipped to campaign than to govern.\n\nIt’s hard to see how his brazen flip-flops won’t reinforce this impression among voters of all stripes, especially if he ends up feeling compelled to reverse himself again to appease his left flank.\n\nDEMOCRATS REJECT NEWSOM’S ATTEMPTS TO DISTANCE FROM THE PARTY’S UNPOPULARITY\n\nThat Newsom has launched headfirst into this new approach without much thought as to the downsides is a testament to just how much the country has changed over the last few years. For decades, progressives seemed to hold all the cards in just about every culture war battle. In 2024, Americans at last stood athwart this leftward march, yelling “Stop!” so clearly that it compelled the governor to take decisive action to answer it.\n\nBut in his attempt to rescue his party from the no-man’s-land it finds itself occupying — indeed, the very ground he helped lead it to — he’s only managed to advance further into it himself.\n\nIsaac Schorr is a staff writer at Mediaite and a Robert Novak fellow at the Fund for American Studies."

        "full_text": "Erik Menendez was 19 years old in 1990 when he stepped off a plane at Los Angeles International Airport and surrendered to detectives waiting to arrest him for murder. His 22-year-old brother, Lyle, had been taken into custody days earlier as he left their family’s Beverly Hills mansion – where the siblings had fatally shot their parents in what would become one of the most sensational cases of the 80s and 90s.\n\nThe brothers haven’t been free since.\n\nAfter spending more than three decades in prison for the killings of their parents, Erik and Lyle – along with family members, a former prosecutor and an army of online supporters – are determined to have their life sentences reexamined and secure their freedom.\n\nThough their bid for release gained extraordinary momentum under former Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón, newly installed District Attorney Nathan Hochman has vehemently opposed the brothers’ efforts.\n\nNow middle-aged, the Menendez siblings still live in public memory as the sweater-clad young men who took the witness stand in the 90s, portrayed by prosecutors and media as arrogant, self-assured heirs to their parents’ $14 million estate. If released, the brothers would reintegrate into society as men in their 50s who have spent the majority of their adult lives navigating prison.\n\nThough they have largely remained out of the public eye, a handful of close family members have never stopped communicating with them, following the siblings from county jail to maximum security prisons and, finally, an innovative California correctional facility.\n\nAnamaria Baralt, a cousin of the Menendez brothers, was stunned by the trauma and voracious national attention surrounding her cousins’ crime. As children, the trio of cousins was almost inseparable, and as a young college student when the murders happened, she didn’t think twice about remaining by the brothers’ side as they faced trial and imprisonment.\n\n“It never occurred to me not to,” she said. “I love them more than anything. Always have, always will.”\n\nBaralt and a coalition of more than 20 Menendez relatives are pleading for the brothers to be released, pointing to society’s changed understanding of childhood sexual abuse as well as years of prison rehabilitative programs the brothers have led as they serve life sentences.\n\n“Release was never on the table, and they did it anyway, which is really stunning to me,” Baralt said of her cousins’ prison programs. “It was a desire to make their lives worth something, and they’ve succeeded. As far as I’m concerned, they are living full lives, really full lives, full of purpose and meaning.”\n\nNow, the family is anxiously waiting to hear whether a judge, or even Gov. Gavin Newsom, will decide Erik and Lyle can be free. A hearing will be held April 11 to determine whether Hochman can withdraw his predecessor’s motion supporting the brothers’ release.\n\nHere is how the brothers have spent the last three decades behind bars.\n\nJailhouse neighbors with O.J. Simpson\n\nErik and Lyle spent six years in Los Angeles County jail awaiting the results of their trials and subsequent retrial, eventually sharing cellblock conversations with fellow detainee O.J. Simpson, who had been charged with murder in the 1994 killing of his ex-wife.\n\nThe trio had already met long before their high-profile trials. Simpson visited the Menendez family’s home in the 1970s, even tossing a football with Lyle in the backyard. At the time, José Menendez was an executive at Hertz and Simpson was a spokesperson for the car rental company.\n\n“My brother was in the cell next to him for most of his trial, so we had a lot of conversations,” Lyle told People Magazine in 2017. Simpson, Lyle remembered, seemed “very overwhelmed by what was happening to him.”\n\nSimpson was ultimately acquitted, which Erik believed impacted the outcome of the brother’s second trial. Simpson’s case – often pitched side-by-side with the Menendezes’ in newspapers – triggered public outrage at the Los Angeles justice system.\n\n“There was a sense extreme injustice had happened. And now we’re gonna have to right it with every defendant that comes up, and we were the next defendant,” Erik said in the A&E docuseries “The Menendez Murders: Erik Tells All.”\n\n“There’s a good probability that I will never see him again”\n\nFacing the reality of their 1996 life sentences without the possibility of parole, the brothers began to fear they would be sent to separate prisons, a stark likelihood as prosecutors publicly called for Erik and Lyle to be split up.\n\nIn a 1996 interview with Barbara Walters, Erik said he believed there was “a good probability that I will never see (Lyle) again.” He added: “(There are) some things that you cannot take and there are some things that you can endure. With everything taken away, it’s the last thing you can take.”\n\nTheir fears came true in September 1996, when they were separated and bussed more than 300 miles apart to what were then maximum security prisons: Lyle sent to California Correctional Institution and Erik to Folsom State Prison, a notoriously violent facility with a reputation for being “the end of the line.”\n\n“They put him in one van and I didn’t understand why they were putting me in another van. I started screaming out to Lyle and they shut the door. It was the last time I saw him.” Erik recalled in the Netflix documentary “The Menendez Brothers.”\n\nLyle has described the beginning of their prison life as “tremendously painful,” recalling in the Netflix documentary Erik attempted a hunger strike in an effort to prevent their separation.\n\nThough Baralt rarely spoke with Lyle about the murders or prison violence, she could tell the separation weighed on him. “That was always hard on him to worry about Erik.”\n\nFacing violence under maximum security\n\nBaralt kept in regular contact with Lyle, constantly concerned for the brothers’ safety as she heard through other family members they were experiencing bullying and at times physical assault.\n\n“That’s a rough place full of rough people. So I’ve always been concerned,” Baralt said.\n\nErik has recounted being bullied violently while at Folsom, describing in the Netflix documentary that the brothers’ facilities were “restrictive, violent prisons where we were constantly in chains, in shackles, and handcuffed.”\n\n“I remember the day that I was told Lyle just got assaulted and got his jaw broken,” Erik told TMZ earlier this year. “I’m thinking, ‘He’s over there. I’m going through this over here, and at least we could protect each other, maybe, if we were together.’”\n\nLyle refused to fight back when attacked, prompting prison officials to move him to a special needs yard for his safety, according to a resentencing motion filed in court. Baralt said the action “absolutely aligns” with the man she knows.\n\n“Something that has always bothered me with the portrayals of (Lyle) through the years and all of the scripted shows is that they always portray him as this hot headed, rage-fueled person, and I have literally never heard him raise his voice — not once in my entire life. So I’m not sure where that comes from,” Baralt said.\n\nReunited at an innovative facility\n\nAfter more than 20 years apart, Erik and Lyle were reunited in 2018 at one of California’s innovative correctional facilities, which runs a one-of-kind prison yard, fully functioning bakery and shoe factory, and a laundry list of rehabilitative programs such as yoga, meditation and art classes.\n\nLyle was transferred to the RJ Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego in 2013, but Erik didn’t arrive at the prison years later. There, the siblings have appeared to take full advantage of a prison initiative that allows inmates to create and run their own rehabilitation programs.\n\nThese rehabilitative efforts have formed the backbone of former district attorney Gascón’s argument that the brothers should be released – an effort now being capsized by his successor.\n\nIn his motion supporting their resentencing, former district attorney Gascón cited a laundry list of prison programs run by the siblings. Erik has helped start at least five programs, including a support group for disabled and elderly inmates. He learned American Sign Language so he could communicate with the deaf inmates he lives with, the motion said.\n\nErik is also certified to teach courses on meditation and has led workshops on addressing “toxic shame” and alternatives to violence, according to Gascón’s motion.\n\n“At one point with all the programs and classes Erik Menendez founded, Erik Menendez was (and may still be) teaching five different classes in the course of a week,” the motion stated.\n\nChandrika Kelso, director of the Alternatives to Violence program at the prison, described Erik as a “good leader” who “interacts beautifully” with workshop participants.\n\nErik also threw himself into painting, becoming a skilled artist, producing intricate oil paintings and contributing to murals across the prison yard.\n\n“Art was an important outlet for me. I took to it like someone who is thirsty takes to water,” he told TMZ. “Sometimes I would paint for 12 hours a day. From morning to night I would just be painting.”\n\nThe murals are part of a massive prison beautification program founded by Lyle, the Green Space Project. The initiative is part of California’s effort to reduce recidivism, in part by “normalizing” the prison environment and making it more closely resemble the outside world. “The more life in prison resembles life in the community,” the project states, “the easier it will be to transition upon release.”\n\nLyle has helped raise more than $250,000 for Green Space, which plans to install trees, grass and outdoor community gathering spaces. The project would also include shady areas for the service dogs prisoners help train for Guide Dogs of America.\n\nGabe Rosales, an outside volunteer who helps coordinate Green Space, said the program is an example of “generative justice” where prisoners are “able to feel like they’re part of the community” and create something of value.\n\nLyle cofounded a group for inmates to explore how their negative childhood experiences may have led to their criminal behavior and a mentorship group in which prisoners with life sentences mentor younger inmates who are eligible for release.\n\nInmate-led programs like those at RJ Donovan can be more impactful than those led by outside facilitators or prison personnel, said Rosales, who is formerly incarcerated and is now pursuing a doctorate in criminology at the University of California Irvine.\n\n“People are willing to let their guard down, and they actually get something out of it, as opposed to being spoken to by somebody that has no experience at all with what you’re dealing with,” Rosales said.\n\n“Finding a meaning in life”\n\nMost of the programs operated by Erik and Lyle were founded years before they gained new hope for release, but program facilitators and Menendez family members say the brothers plan to continue their work – whether inside prison or out of it.\n\n“Hopefully they’ll continue to do it on the outside, but even if they were to stay inside, they’re really, truly making their community better,” Baralt said.\n\nThough the brothers enjoyed the resounding support of former district attorney Gascón, their chances of release have been cast into doubt under Hochman, the new DA who has opposed their request for a new trial and is attempting to withdraw his predecessor’s resentencing motion. The decisions now lie with a judge.\n\nGascón focused his motion heavily on the brothers’ rehabilitative efforts, but Hochman insists the activities are not enough to justify their freedom. Instead, Hochman said he believes the siblings have failed to take full responsibility for their crime and accused them of perpetuating a decades-long lie they killed their parents in self-defense after years of childhood abuse at the hands of their father.\n\nHochman has said he would reconsider his opposition if the brothers admit “they have lied to everyone for the past 30 years.”\n\nBut Erik and Lyle have consistently maintained their claims and the brothers have remained outspoken about the trauma of sexual abuse, saying they have received thousands of letters from abuse survivors.\n\nBaralt called Hochman a “side show” and said the brothers won’t reverse their decades-long defense.\n\n“There is no part of me that thinks that Lyle and Erik are going to capitulate to his demands,” Baralt said. “That would be a slap in the face to every survivor that they have stood up for in their lives.”\n\nIf released, the brothers have said they would continue their advocacy for prison rehabilitation and childhood abuse survivors, according to Baralt. Kelso said she has spoken to Lyle and Erik about working with her nonprofit, Helping without Prejudice, to expand their programs to other prisons.\n\n“They are driven to meet their goals of personal and professional edification,” Kelso said. “I think their motivation comes from within. They tend to see the brighter sides of life.”\n\nDespite the outcome of their appeal for release, Baralt believes the brothers will positively impact the lives of the people around them – whether inside or outside the prison walls.\n\n“They have been an asset to society, even without ever having the hope of being released into society,” she said."

It wasn’t just the thought of other people knowing what I had done; I also had to face myself, and that is a sick feeling – it is guilt, shame.”\n\nAndy had been watching and sharing images of children being sexually abused for several months before the police appeared at his door. He tried at first to keep it from his wife: “I was afraid she would ask me to leave. I wouldn’t have blamed her if she had.”\n\nWhen they got home, he told her his story: that a spiralling porn addiction had led him to ever darker places, chatrooms where people talked about sex and porn, and shared images and videos. “That was where someone sent me a picture of a child, in exchange for some porn I sent them.”\n\nUnlike Andy, Mark didn’t immediately realise why the police had come for him. “My then wife came in looking worried and said, ‘There are police at the door.’ We were living in a wealthy area, so I thought they were there about some recent burglaries. But then they told me they needed to speak to me alone. They said I was being arrested for having indecent images of children.”\n\nMark claims he was shellshocked. “I knew I had looked at lots of porn but I genuinely did not think there was anybody underage in there. They said they had found 200 illegal images.” From the outside, Mark was a successful businessman, travelling regularly for work. His arrest was a public humiliation. “There were four of them, with body cameras on, in two cars. They told my boys, ‘Don’t worry, Daddy is just helping us out’ and put me in the back of one of the cars. In the picture the police took that day, I look suicidal.”\n\nIn England and Wales, 850 men a month are arrested for online child abuse offences. They come from every walk of life: teachers, police officers, bus drivers, doctors. Those on the frontline are warning of another alarming trend: a significant shift towards younger offenders among those picked up for watching illegal material.\n\nThe arrests are just one metric pointing towards a spiralling global crisis. Last year was the worst on record for instances of online child sexual abuse imagery, with the UK’s Internet Watch Foundation acting to remove content from 300,000 web pages, each containing at least one, if not hundreds or thousands, of illegal images and videos.\n\nNow, police, charities, lawyers and child protection experts are asking what is driving this tidal wave of offending, and finding one common thread: the explosion over the past 10 to 20 years of free-to-view and easily accessible online pornography. Material so violent it would have been considered highly extreme a generation ago is now readily available on iPads, desktops and the phones in teenagers’ pockets. A growing body of research is beginning to warn of how problematic porn habits can be a pathway into viewing images of children being abused.\n\nI have been writing about the online child abuse crisis for five years. Time and again I have heard warnings from those on the frontline that there is an unambiguous link between the two. Do the sites that profit from porn have questions to answer about this link? Can the connection be broken? And the big question: is the explosion of child abuse imagery online feeding a demand for this material, or creating one?\n\nThe scale of the problem faced by the police was made clear to the public last year, when former BBC presenter Huw Edwards was given a suspended sentence, avoiding jail time, after being found guilty of accessing indecent photographs of children as young as seven. This highlighted the fact that most people – around eight out of 10 – caught with images of children being sexually abused are not jailed. The National Crime Agency has called for more prison sentences, warning that up to 830,000 adults in the UK, 1.6% of the population, pose a threat to children.\n\nAndy was sent to prison for six months for watching and sharing images of child abuse. I spoke to him through the Leeds-based national agency Safer Lives, which works with men at every stage, from arrest to post-conviction counselling, to help them change their behaviour. Like many of the men they encounter, Andy argues that he has no intrinsic interest in children, but was led through a porn addiction to seek out ever more extreme images. “I am fully accountable,” Andy tells me on the phone. “None of this is an excuse. I look back at what I did with huge regret and shame. But I didn’t start out wanting to see kids. I was addicted to porn and I went down a road of being totally desensitised as I got further and further from what was normal.\n\n“I was using porn as a coping mechanism for all sorts of things – stress, loss, general life problems. When you masturbate to porn, you get an intense dopamine hit. Then those first videos start to become boring. Your brain starts to say, that’s not good enough. Soon you are watching rape fantasies – there are loads of categories like this on mainstream sites. Then it’s teenagers. The algorithms keep showing you more extreme stuff.”\n\nHe argues that the mainstream porn sites encourage an interest in young girls. “They push the boundaries as much as they can, with content around young women dressed in school uniforms, for example; incest themes; old men paired with young women.”\n\nI ask where his own moral judgment was when watching videos of teenagers. “Yes, I could have wondered if those girls were really over 18. But you think, well, I’m on a site anyone can access, it’s legal. You can watch this on the bus, right? You are in an environment that is eroding your sense of responsibility.”\n\nAs many offenders do, he moved to chatrooms where men shared images and videos from porn sites they liked. It was in this space, he says, that he was first sent a picture that was clearly of a child. “You know it’s wrong, but the dopamine hit from what you are doing overrides everything else. I think the pathways in my brain had been changed by all the porn I had watched.”\n\nAfterwards, he admits, “You feel sick and horrible. For years I didn’t talk about this. But now I want to stop other men continuing down the path I went down.”\n\nMark has a similar story. He is open in saying his interest began with legal material of teen girls but says he was taken to images of children through hours of clicking on everything offered to him. “I have gone through about 40 sessions of counselling to try to understand why I ended up in a place where someone could knock on my door to arrest me. I was horrified and disgusted with myself, and I will be until the day I die.”\n\nPorn was a coping mechanism when he was away from his family, he says, and it quickly got out of control. “I worked abroad a lot and was bored and lonely. I was bringing up porn on my phone the moment I was travelling, watching it sometimes for five hours a day.\n\n“The police never found a single search for images of children: it was all from clicking through links – what the algorithms were offering me. Porn sites have a button that says ‘See more like this’. I was desensitised, I had looked at so much teen porn.”\n\nMark was convicted of possessing images in categories A, B and C. The worst of these, A, involves the penetration of children under 18. “I understand now that my reaction should have been to turn off the computer when I was being offered images of young girls. But when you have been watching porn for three or four hours, you might have clicked 200 times. You are in such a bizarre place, your hormones are all over the place. You – your brain – are out of control.”\n\nAs part of his counselling, Mark has written a letter to one of the young girls he watched, “not to send, but for therapy. She could, I suppose, have been 16 or 17. It was a long letter. I explained how I got to be there, I was hugely apologetic.”\n\nThe idea that there is a path that for some people leads from legal porn to videos of children being abused is controversial. Many of the men being arrested for online child abuse offences pose a serious risk to children. But there is no doubt that the profile of offenders has changed in recent years. Michael Sheath worked with child abusers for more than 30 years and now advises police forces around Europe on offender profiling. When I speak to him, he has just returned from an Interpol conference on online child abuse. “I’ve been every year for 14 years and we have seen a shift over that time, from what we would call serious criminal paedophiles, the type who are organising the abuse of kids in the Philippines, and we still see those, to a huge number of lower-level offenders. It’s a huge burden on the police.”\n\nHe is in no doubt that the change is linked to increasingly easy access to violent and extreme pornography. “I see men who have gone down what I call an ‘escalating pathway’. The link is unambiguous.”\n\nSheath speaks powerfully about what he sees as a horrific impact of porn on societal taboos that have traditionally protected children. “The threshold for abusive behaviour is through the floor. It used to be that child abuse material was hard to find and looking at it was extremely risky. The mindset of someone searching for it would be ‘I am a total sex criminal’ - they knew they were leaving the norms of society.\n\nNow it is barely taboo to watch children being abused, and that is linked to porn. Look on a mainstream porn site and you’ll immediately see titles like ‘Auntie takes the boys’ virginity’ or ‘Stepdad and stepdaughter’. When I started working 30 years ago, that was really out-there outrageous, pervy and wrong. Now it’s seen as a laugh.”\n\nThe videos he is referring to are legal content acted by adults, not hidden but watched by millions in the UK. “There is a slope and it is slippery, but that doesn’t mean men shouldn’t be held to account for being complicit in the abuse of the child.”\n\nSerious research is now being done into how this slippery slope works. In a groundbreaking two-year project, Finnish group Protect Children posted questionnaires on the dark web to reach people viewing illegal material in several countries, including the UK. They collected data from 4,549 anonymous child sexual abuse offenders. A third of respondents admitted that sexual interest in children was a key reason why they searched for child sexual abuse material. Nearly two-thirds reported a sexual interest in under-18s – mostly teens between 15 and 17. Heavy use of pornography is described as one of the “facilitating factors” that can play an important role in lowering the barrier to offending.\n\nMore than 50% of those who admitted watching online child abuse said they were not seeking these images when they were first exposed to them. This did not mean they did not go on to search for violent and harmful images of children. The prevalence of this “accidental viewing” is underlined by the huge number of respondents – over two-thirds – who said they first saw child sexual abuse material when they were under 18. Of those, 40% were under 13.\n\nAlong with other countries, the UK is bringing in tighter controls on the porn industry. Porn sites will be required to have age verification processes in place by July to stop children viewing their content, a process that will be monitored by Ofcom under the new Online Safety Act (OSA). But the OSA does not ban or control certain common practices in porn, such as strangulation, sexual fetishisation of incest or the abuse of children acted by adults. The government argues depiction of sexual strangulation is banned but a recent in-depth review of porn by Baroness Bertin, a Conservative peer, warned it is not, in reality, covered by case law. She called for tighter regulation of “legal but harmful pornography like choking, violent and degrading acts … even content that could encourage child sexual abuse”. While headlines picked out the call to ban strangulation, Bertin also demanded clearer rules around “incest, step-incest and ‘teen’ porn”.\n\nFor years, evidence has been building that extreme material is too easily available to first-time viewers, served to them by the powerful algorithms that drive porn sites. In 2021, research professor Dr Fiona Vera-Gray and others at Durham University found that one in every eight titles on the front pages of the most popular porn sites showed sexual violence against women and girls. They also found that videos tagged as “teen” were more likely to be linked to violence.\n\nIn January, Pornhub’s owners, private equity firm Ethical Capital Partners (ECP), arrived in London from the US and Canada to lobby against the UK’s implementation of age verification. Sarah Bain, vice-president of public engagement for ECP, and Alexzandra Kekesi of Pornhub pushed for “device-based” age blocks instead of “site-based” checks – ie the phone would block underage users, not the website.\n\nBain and Kekesi insist that Pornhub is an industry leader in ensuring content does not “cross the line” into abusive themes. They say they carefully monitor content to ensure all performers are over 18. “We have very strict protocols for the type of content that could potentially be harmful,” Bain says. She refers to the “constantly evolving” list Pornhub says it has of 34,000 banned words. “This would prevent anyone uploading content with these words, or commenting under a video with these words. We have banned terms that are legal. We make a decision not to monetise content on those themes. This is not always popular with content creators, but we are willing to be out there, modelling to other folks in the porn industry that you can be an ethical business.” They also argued that some fantasy themes can be “empowering” for those engaged in safe and consensual BDSM.\n\nIn 2021, the anti-trafficking organisation Cease published a report that listed some of Pornhub’s banned terms next to words that are still allowed, to highlight what it says is a continuing presence of highly violent content themed around the abuse of children and teenagers. The word “rape” is banned, but permitted terms include “dazed”, “broken”, “degraded”, and interactions based on power abuses are common (“stepdad and stepdaughter”, where the stepdaughter might be “scared or trapped”). The word “incest” is blocked, yet permitted terms include “daddy and daughter, grandpa and granddaughter”. Words relating to “teen” (over 18) and “smallness” are common.\n\nPornhub’s own guidelines state: “We … prohibit content, including fictional, simulated, or animated, that features or depicts ... nonconsensual sexual activity, including coerced or forced sexual acts, rape, or sexual assault.”\n\nPornhub says there are subtleties to certain words that they address through moderation. A spokesman said: “Some of the examples you listed that are not banned require context to understand. ‘Broken’, for example, has many different uses that would be perfectly within our terms of service. That’s why it’s so important that all content uploaded also undergoes our industry-leading trust and safety process as well.\n\n“Even terms that are not banned on our platforms may be flagged by our internal system. Words like ‘daughter’ or ‘degraded’ or ‘scared’ are all flagged specifically to moderators and given higher scrutiny for contextual assessment.\n\nJust because a video uses the word ‘father’, or ‘dad’, or ‘daddy’, or any other word like that, does not mean the person featured is a relative of their co-performer. [There] are a number of scenarios where a person may be called ‘daddy’, or another title like that, that are certainly not incestuous.\n\n“Just because a word could, in certain contexts, be used in an abusive way, that does not mean that by ‘not banning it’, we are allowing content that violates our guidelines.”\n\nThe company has also partnered with the UK’s Internet Watch Foundation and anti-child abuse charity Lucy Faithfull Foundation to add warnings that pop up when users appear to be searching for child abuse content.\n\nUnderlying all this is the question of whether porn can be seen as addictive in the way Mark and Andy describe. Unlike other behavioural addictions, such as gambling and gaming, pornography addiction is not included in the International Classification of Diseases, compiled by the World Health Organization. It is instead defined as a compulsive sexual behaviour.\n\nFor at least a decade, mental health experts have warned that the release of the pleasure chemical dopamine during porn viewing means it impacts the brain in the same way as addictive substances such as drugs. In 2013, the psychiatrist Norman Doidge warned, “The brain is ‘neuroplastic’ and not only can it change, but it works by changing in response to repeated mental experiences.” He describes how dopamine is released as we accomplish goals, so we gain the thrill that encourages us to do it again. “Dopamine is secreted at moments of sexual excitement and novelty. Porn scenes, filled with novel sexual ‘partners’, fire the reward centre. The images get reinforced, altering the users’ sexual tastes.”\n\nLast month, the Lucy Faithfull Foundation found that a fifth of adults reported their pornography viewing becoming gradually more extreme. Pornhub denies this is its intention and says users may “discover” new interests on porn sites but that they are not being deliberately pushed to extreme material.\n\nA Pornhub spokesman told the Guardian: “Our understanding … is that many of the studies that suggest that porn is harmful to society are methodologically flawed and/or ideologically biased. Most research finds more neutral or ambiguous results, and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders does not recognise porn addiction as a valid diagnosis.”\n\nWhat is clear is that problematic use is rising – including among young people. At the Lucy Faithfull Foundation, their clients are getting younger, so much so that in 2023 they launched a specialist service for teenagers. DCI Tony Garner leads a team of online child abuse officers in Worcester. They carry out “the knock” three or four times a week and are increasingly finding teenagers behind the door. “We are seeing people who are turning 18 and have had 10 years’ exposure to hardcore porn. My officers are finding young people watching the most abhorrent material, including child abuse.” He is clear that the police cannot deal with this on their own. “As a country, as a society, it feels completely out of control.”\n\nMarcus Johnstone of PCD solicitors specialises in defending sex offenders. He says he represents “people of every age, from every background. Most of them have children, many are very intelligent. They are looking at or requesting and selling images and videos. Or they are chatting to children on gaming sites and apps. I often wonder if parents know how many of the people their kids are gaming with online are people like my clients.”\n\nBut, like Garner, he is seeing an increasing trend towards younger offenders – often in their mid- or even early teens. “A lot of my clients now are parents who have called me because their child has been arrested. This is generation porn. They may have been looking for videos of teens their own age. Or they may have been talking to predatory adults online who shared material with them.”\n\nJohnstone mentions the case of a young teen who wanted to see videos of teens his own age, “but these are category A images, which is a serious crime with a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. The law is turning these young people into criminals at an alarming rate. I have seen young people banned from being in the same house as their younger siblings.”\n\nSheath says his decades working with offenders has made him incredibly concerned about the way children are growing up with access to porn. “This is an experiment we are doing as a society and I think we can agree it’s going pretty badly. Before the smartphone, most people’s first experience of sex was with a living person and that included resistance, pushback, romance. Now young people are growing up with unfettered access to porn, and porn norms are not about consent. They are about ‘strangle the bitch’, ‘have sex with your stepmum’. It’s shaping their erotic templates.”\n\nPornhub and ECP argue forcefully that they do not want children on their sites. “It’s shocking that we have to say this,” Bain says. “We want age verification. But the way we are seeing it approached – it’s not effective. They are targeting individual platforms. Louisiana, the first US state to implement this form of age verification, lost 80% of visitors to the site when they met the age check. Now, these people are not giving up on porn. They will go to other sites with no barrier.”\n\nIn most US states, Pornhub has opted to shut down its site rather than comply with age checks. It won’t be drawn on whether it will do the same in the UK – its fifth largest global market – if asked to age-block its sites from July. Kekesi says only, “We will obey the law.”\n\nIn the coming weeks, yet more men will wake up to a knock on the door and find the police outside. More images of children being abused will be taken and sent spiralling around the internet. Mark hopes some men might take a step back before it happens to them. At one point, he was prevented from being alone with his children but now he has unsupervised access again. His marriage ended and he began dating. He faced the difficult decision of how to tell his new girlfriend about his offences. “She was very kind, she let me talk. The natural reaction would be: urgh, you’re a paedophile. It’s worse than murdering someone. But I’m not a paedophile, I was just an idiot.”\n\nHe believes men have an urgent role to play in supporting the men around them. “There are pressures on men in modern life, and porn is one of the outlets people seek. But it can lead you down a dark path. I’m more observant now of other men’s mental health. I work in a tough industry but I ask men I know, ‘Are you OK?’”\n\nAndy says he has learned he has an addictive personality. “You own your actions as an offender. You have to. But porn was what I went to when I had broken relationships, stress at work; porn made me feel better. And the hit is stronger if you know what you are doing is not legal or not right.”\n\nLike many offenders, he says he is glad he was caught. “Without the arrest, I don’t think I could have just stopped. Think about alcohol, gambling – you don’t just suddenly stop. You have to go to AA, you have to do the work. I’ve had help now and I realise how awful it is. These are real children.” He adds, “I’ve done courses with Safer Lives, with the Lucy Faithfull Foundation. I’ve got apps on my phone including one that links everything I do online to my wife as my accountability partner. I see a therapist once a month.”\n\nJenny Greensmith is one of the lead practioners at Safer Lives working with men like Andy and Mark. She has a background as a probation officer specialising in sexual offending and has sat through countless hours of conversations with offenders. “What I’m concerned about is oversimplifying this problem,” she says. “We don’t want to remove personal responsibility or suggest porn is always a gateway to harmful behaviour. But we want men to seek help; it won’t help if we regard them as perverts. I meet a lot of men who are not able to recognise their feelings, let alone manage them. The internet is an easy way to switch off from emotions.”\n\nShe is acutely aware of the real children hidden behind the words “category A, B and C”, particularly the teens whose videos the men say are easily confused with legal porn. “The CPS will often mention if pre-teen or young children are in the category A images because it’s an aggravating factor for sentencing. But it sometimes feels like an arbitrary line that diminishes the harm caused to people over 13 of having their most vulnerable experiences shared to millions online.”\n\nWhatever offences the men have carried out, she stresses that dismissing them as beyond help can have serious consequences. “I understand some people will feel that is all they deserve, but I disagree. I am also acutely aware they often have children and families who will be destroyed by this.”\n\nShe would really like to reach people before they hear the knock at the door. “Men often tell us, ‘I wish I had known you were here earlier, I wanted to stop.’”\n\nIf you or someone you know is worried about child sexual abuse, the confidential and anonymous Stop It Now helpline is available at 0808 1000 900, or you can use their live chat or secure email; stopitnow.org.uk.

        "full_text": "It’s less than a week since Donald Trump’s sensational announcement that he was unilaterally ending the world’s trading system with the imposition of a 10% minimum tariff for trading with the US – and a very much higher rate for those countries unfortunate enough to have the US as a major export partner. Long-term allies such as Japan and South Korea have been hammered with tariffs of around 25%, while export-dependent poorer countries such as Vietnam, which sells about a third of its exports to the US, have been hit with tariffs in excess of 45%. A further round of global debt crises is possible as heavily indebted countries face the sudden loss of export earnings.\n\nGlobal stock markets have tumbled as panicked investors dump shares, and political condemnation has been near-universal. China has already retaliated with 34% tariffs, threatening an escalating trade war. Right now, it looks and feels like disastrous overreach by a uniquely erratic administration at the behest of a president with a terrifyingly limited grasp of how the modern economy works.\n\nTrump has talked about imposing tariffs on the world since he first rose to prominence in the 1980s, when his target was Japan. In a political career notable for its jack-knifes in policy and direction, tariffs – “the most beautiful word in the dictionary” – have been a constant. But this is about far more than his long-cherished whims. However inconsistent or even confused Trump may sometimes appear to be, those around him have a clear-eyed view of what they want to achieve.\n\nHis Treasury secretary, hedgefund billionaire Scott Bessent, has spoken of a “global economic reordering” that he intends to shape to the benefit of the US’s elite. Trump’s new chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Stephen Miran, wrote a lengthy paper, A User’s Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System, shortly before his appointment. The latter is particularly ambitious – detailing how the US should use not only tariffs but also the threat of withdrawing its security support to compel its friends and allies to accept cuts in payments due from the Federal Reserve on their US Treasury bills. This would be a potentially massive loss to them, akin, in reality, to a US debt default. But it is tariffs that are the cutting edge of the plan – leveraging the US’s power as the world’s largest consumer and greatest debtor to compel other countries into a negotiation on terms.\n\nAfter decades winning in an international trading game it wrote and refereed the rules for, the US is now facing serious competition – primarily from China, but with Europe as an expensive irritant. The response of this administration is to kick over the table, and demand everyone starts again. What it ultimately wants is a cheaper dollar to revive US manufacturing and Chinese competition held off, all the while keeping the dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the rest of the world will pay the price.\n\nThere are precedents. In October 1979, Paul Volcker, newly appointed as chair of the Federal Reserve, drove up interest rates to a remarkable 13% in a bid to tackle inflation, later raising them to 17%. Soon the US was in recession. Millions lost their jobs over the next two years, notably in manufacturing, where soaring interest rates had driven up the value of the dollar, making US exports less affordable on the world market. After a light easing of interest rate hell by the Fed, Volcker applied a second dose of the medicine, driving interest rates up to 19% and forcing the economy back into a double-dip recession. Unemployment peaked at around 10% in late 1982.\n\nBut by mid-1983, inflation had come down to 2.5%. For the rest of the 1980s, the US economy boomed. The “Volcker shock” appeared to have worked. Volcker is today a folk hero among central bankers: Ben Bernanke, chair of the Federal Reserve during the 2008 crisis, praised Volcker’s “independence” and willingness to brazen out the political storm.\n\nMore decisive than lower inflation, however, was the reshaping of the US economy Volcker’s interest-rate shock accelerated: with manufacturing in freefall, investment flooded into finance and property, firing up what became the great credit bubble of the 1990s and 2000s. The world economy was reordered around a US that acted as a giant sink for its output – swallowing exports from the rest of the world on seemingly limitless borrowing. China’s extraordinary boom was the flipside of US debt and deindustrialisation. The Volcker shock, more than any other single action, created the globalised world system that Trump is now bent on destroying.\n\nFew would have bet on Volcker’s world-shaping capacity at the time. The stock market response to the shock was immediate and unanimous. US shares plunged by a record 8% in the two days after his announcement. The S&P 500 lost 27% of its value before August 1982 – two years of grinding decline. Manufacturers and unions hated it, understandably: they were on the wrong side of an epochal reconfiguration of US capitalism. But they were not the only losers: rising interest rates in the US meant less developed countries had to spend more on servicing debts, just as recession squeezed their major export markets. The result was the so-called “third world” debt crisis, as heavily indebted countries across the global south plunged into spirals of economic decline and soaring indebtedness.\n\nOver the weekend, Bessent and commerce secretary Howard Lutnick were doing the media rounds, insisting that there would be no climbdown on the tariffs. Trump is not for turning on what is clearly for him a personal crusade. Already, countries such as Vietnam are promising to cut all their tariffs on US goods – a clear and brutal demonstration of the US’s continuing economic power. The administration has claimed 50 other countries have also asked to open negotiations. By the end of the week, expect Trump to be triumphantly announcing more such concessions from economies in the global south. His real target – China – will be a far tougher nut to crack, if it breaks at all.\n\nPerhaps the rolling market chaos will become too much. Perhaps the administration will blink first. There is no guarantee this extraordinary gamble will work, not even for those in the clique around Trump. But it would be a mistake to assume it cannot work – and however the pieces now land, they will not return to their old places."

        "full_text": "With President Donald Trump’s announcement of “Liberation Day” trade tariffs Wednesday, the world appears to have crossed into a new era.\n\nFor nearly a century, the international economy has been driven by the seemingly unstoppable force of globalization, built on the premise that free trade benefits all.\n\nThose days seem to be over.\n\nDozens of new tariffs on U.S. imports, including a 54% tax on Chinese products and a 20% levy on goods made in the European Union, have led leaders around the world to lament an apparent return to the protectionism of centuries past.\n\nIndeed, the world has swung from free trade to protectionism and back again before. Yet it has never seen a moment quite like this one.\n\n“Countries have reintroduced tariffs in the past,” says Fredrik Erixon, director of the European Centre for International Political Economy in Brussels. “What is rare is that countries use new programs of protectionism to basically hurt their own economy.”\n\nWhat are the roots of free trade?\n\nEconomists have been advocating for free trade as far back as the 16th century in imperial Spain. Yet it was not until the 18th century that such ideas began to gain traction.\n\nUntil then, mercantilist thinking had led European nations to prioritize the accumulation of wealth, exporting as much as possible and importing as little as possible. Adam Smith and later David Ricardo showed that, in fact, freer trade creates more prosperity for both partners by opening doors to cheaper goods and allowing nations to specialize in sectors where they enjoy a comparative advantage.\n\nThe industrial revolution meant Europe and North America had more goods to trade than ever before, as well as railways and steam engines to carry them. A shift toward free trade took place during the 19th century, sometimes called the “first age of globalization,” when tariffs on grain were lifted, and new trade agreements spread across Europe.\n\nSome such agreements were imposed, as when Britain and its militarily victorious allies obliged the Chinese government to open its market to free trade.\n\nYet protectionism has often made a comeback during moments of crisis or uncertainty. The impetus for free trade slowed in the second half of the 19th century, first by an economic depression in the 1870s, and came to a halt with the outbreak of World War I.\n\nThe end of World War II brought a newfound commitment to free trade and global cooperation in Europe and the United States – a commitment that has lasted to a greater or lesser degree until now.\n\nWhat is the case for protectionism?\n\nFree trade has long had its critics.\n\nGerman thinker Friedrich List responded to Adam Smith by arguing that some protective measures are needed to allow less-advanced nations to shelter nascent industries until they can compete internationally. Most advanced economies matured behind the shelter of protectionist policies.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, the U.S. passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which raised tariffs to their highest level in the past century – until Mr. Trump’s new policy.\n\nMeant to shield the struggling American economy, the heavy tariffs backfired. They sparked a trade war and helped spread America’s economic depression to the rest of the world. The value of international trade fell by two-thirds between 1929 and 1934.\n\nStill, after World War II, many emerging economies, especially in Latin America and Asia, used tariffs to shelter their young industries, just as Europe and North America had done before them. If emerging economies imported all their manufactured goods, went the logic, their own industrial sectors would never develop.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, protectionism had gone out of vogue and a new age of globalization arrived.\n\nWhy has faith in free trade faltered now?\n\nGlobal trade has exploded since the 1980s, as countries around the world have opened and deregulated their economies. But there is a growing sense that what some have called the hyperglobalization of recent decades may have gone too far, without protecting those who lose out from the process.\n\nWhile the U.S. has specialized in high-tech sectors, manufacturing has largely moved to other countries such as Mexico and China. While that has economic benefits for the nations involved, it does not mean that former factory workers in America have gotten new jobs in the tech sector, says Kevin Gallagher, director of the Global Development Policy Center at Boston University.\n\nIn the original economic theory, “some transfer should happen from the gains from the winners to the losers,” says Dr. Gallagher, so that these workers can find new jobs through training and education. By failing to provide such paths, he says, both U.S. political parties have helped pave the way for the current backlash.\n\nOver the past decade, governments have been taking more and more active roles in shaping their nations’ industrial policy; trade restrictions increased by 500% worldwide between 2015 and 2023. Yet these measures, largely meant to boost specific industries and domestic competitiveness, pale in comparison with the Liberation Day tariffs.\n\nWhat does this mean for the current moment?\n\nEconomists such as Dani Rodrik, a professor at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government, have argued that tariffs can be useful when applied moderately and in support of specific policy goals. They also stress that they are not a panacea for economic revival, and that when used indiscriminately, they can wreak havoc.\n\nLeaders in every economic Cabinet around the world are now being forced to decide how to respond to Mr. Trump.\n\n“We built a postwar global multilateral economic system around the United States, and so there isn’t a global infrastructure to try to even mitigate this problem,” says Dr. Gallagher. “It’s every country for itself.”\n\nFortunately for some, he says, the U.S. economy is not as dominant as it was in the 1930s, so the global impact may be more measured than some fear."

        "full_text": "The latest economic numbers don’t look good. The inflation rate, which had inched down in the last two months, started to rise again. Moreover, stock prices continue their downward trend as the market faces ongoing uncertainty and volatility. And then there are tariffs.\n\nThe short-term impact of tariffs may be painful. If the 25% tariffs stick, your favorite European cars will be more expensive — as will all Canadian goods and possibly many Mexican goods. Nearly all American-made cars contain components manufactured elsewhere, meaning their prices will rise too.\n\nAmericans will see a vast increase in their standard of living.\n\nA tariff is just like a tax: It increases the cost of producing a product and, therefore, its price. The key question is how much of that increase will be passed on to consumers through higher prices and how much the producer will need to absorb. That largely depends on how much consumers want the product and whether they can easily find alternatives.\n\nThe consumer will bear most of the tariffs' cost for essential products. For products where consumers say, “I like the product if the price is right,” they will pay a smaller portion. Either way, the price of imported products in the United States will rise.\n\nThat’s the short term. In the long term, Americans will see a vast increase in their standard of living — the most critical outcome of economic policy.\n\nShort-term pain, long-term gain\n\nSince January 2021, prices have increased rapidly. However, personal income has not kept pace, meaning households have been forced to buy less and opt for lower-quality goods, leading to a decline in their standard of living. Over the past 50 months, this steady decline has worn on the average American.\n\nThis needs to stop. Right away.\n\nThe United States must restore domestic manufacturing, especially for critical goods like steel, aluminum, and medical devices. These products are often made overseas simply because it costs less.\n\nAmericans have long believed they should buy goods wherever they are cheapest. But that mindset has caused serious economic harm.\n\nEach year, about $1.2 trillion leaves the country through imports. That wouldn’t pose a problem if U.S. exports matched that amount. Instead, exports total less than $400 billion annually, creating a trade deficit of more than $800 billion.\n\nOnly two solutions exist: import less or export more.\n\nRemoving high tariffs and quotas on American-made products would give U.S. manufacturers better access to foreign markets. More exports could help close the trade gap.\n\nThat’s Trump’s preferred approach — open global markets to American producers. If U.S. companies can shrink the $800 billion deficit, free and fair trade will benefit everyone.\n\nIf that approach doesn’t work, then the U.S. must import less, leading to the second long-term gain.\n\nFor decades, U.S. manufacturers moved production overseas to meet consumer demand for lower prices. As a result, the country lost much of its industrial base.\n\nIn some cases, producing goods abroad makes economic sense. But the United States must bring back a strong commitment to \"Made in America\" products.\n\nThe only way to make that happen is to lower the relative cost of American-made goods. Tariffs can help by raising the price of foreign imports, making U.S. products more competitive at home.\n\nBuckle up!\n\nThis shift will lead to a massive increase in U.S. manufacturing, creating more opportunities for American workers. In turn, this increase in U.S. manufacturing will lead to higher wages, stable prices, and a higher standard of living. Americans will be proud to say “Made in America” is best.\n\nBut in the short term, it will lead to more inflation.\n\nTrump’s plan to combat inflation includes increasing domestic energy production, lowering energy prices and reducing overall inflation. Energy directly accounts for about 7% of the Consumer Price Index and indirectly nearly 30% of it. Though this will buffer some of the effects of inflation, it won’t absorb all of it, and we have to buckle up for some tougher times before we reap the rewards.\n\nHowever, though we will have some short-term pain, the long-term gain will be well worth it."

        "full_text": "Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on Monday issued a temporary administrative stay -- putting off a Monday midnight deadline for the government to return a mistakenly deported Maryland man to the U.S. -- giving the court more time to consider the arguments presented by both sides.\n\nThe Trump administration had asked the Supreme Court for emergency intervention in the case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who the government -- by its own admission -- removed to El Salvador by mistake.\n\nRoberts did not explain the decision. Administrative stays are not rulings on the merits in any way and do not indicate one way or the other how the court might eventually rule.\n\nThe Supreme Court requested a response to Trump's request from Garcia's attorneys by 5 p.m. on Tuesday.\n\nIn the filing earlier Monday, Trump administration Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that a federal court cannot order a president to engage in foreign diplomacy, which he says is implicitly involved in any potential return of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who the Trump administration alleges is a gang member.\n\n\"The Constitution charges the President, not federal district courts, with the conduct of foreign diplomacy and protecting the Nation against foreign terrorists, including by effectuating their removal,\" Sauer writes. \"And this order sets the United States up for failure. The United States cannot guarantee success in sensitive international negotiations in advance, least of all when a court imposes an absurdly compressed, mandatory deadline that vastly complicates the give-and-take of foreign-relations negotiations.\"\n\nAbrego Garcia, despite having protected legal status, was sent to the notorious CECOT mega-prison in El Salvador following what the government said was an \"administrative error.\"\n\nIn March, Abrego Garcia, whose wife is a U.S. citizen and who has 5-year-old child, was stopped by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers who \"informed him that his immigration status had changed,\" according to his attorneys. He was detained and then transferred to a detention center in Texas before being sent to El Salvador.\n\nAbrego Garcia entered the United States in 2011 when he was 16 to escape gang violence in El Salvador, according to his lawyers. Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, the attorney representing Abrego Garcia, said last week his client is not a member of MS-13, as the government has alleged, but said that's an issue for an immigration judge to address.\n\nThe appeal to the Supreme Court came Monday morning, just before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit reaffirmed Friday's ruling by U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis that Abrego Garcia must be returned by Monday at 11:59 p.m. ET.\n\nThe 4th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the Trump administration's emergency motion to block the order to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.\n\nIn a unanimous decision, the panel of three judges agreed Xinis' order requiring the government \"to facilitate and effectuate the return of [Abrego Garcia] by the United States by no later than 11:59 pm on Monday, April 7, 2025,\" should not be stayed.\n\n\"The United States Government has no legal authority to snatch a person who is lawfully present in the United States off the street and remove him from the country without due process,\" the judges said. \"The Government's contention otherwise, and its argument that the federal courts are powerless to intervene, are unconscionable.\"\n\nU.S. Circuit Judge Jamie Wilkinson, who was appointed by Ronald Reagan, said in his opinion that \"there is no question that the government screwed up here.\"\n\n\"If it is truly a mistake, one would also expect the government to do what it can to rectify it,\" Wilkinson said. \"Most of us attempt to undo, to the extent that we can, the mistakes that we have made. But, to the best of my knowledge, the government has not made the attempt here.\"\n\nIn a concurring opinion, U.S. Circuit Judge Robert King and U.S. Circuit Judge Stephanie Thacker said if the government wanted to prove that the Maryland man who was sent to El Salvador was \"a prominent\" member of MS-13, they had \"ample opportunity to do so,\" but has not \"even bothered to try.\"\n\n\"The Government has made no effort to demonstrate that Abrego Garcia is, in fact, a member of any gang,\" said King and Thacker."

He doesn’t really care about the working class. He just cares about himself and his Wall Street buddies.\n\nTrump’s tariffs and Wall Street’s reaction to them prove that all of that was a lie, says Batya Ungar-Sargon, the author of two important recent books, one about the media (Bad News) and the other about the working class (Second Class).\n\n“Liberation Day should go down in history as the day that finally put to bed the myth that Donald Trump only cares about the rich,” she said in a new podcast with me today. “It's the exact opposite. He is waging class warfare on Wall Street for the sake of the American working class. And to punish him, Wall Street is literally just shorting him. They're shorting his agenda. They are betting against America, they are betting against the president because they cannot stand the idea that there is a person with power in America was not on his knees in front of Wall Street asking them, ‘And what would you like next?’ the way both parties have been doing for 60 years.”\n\nThe media has been even worse. “Our economic policy for the last 60 years was put in place by people who are too lazy to get out from behind their laptops,” she said. “They imagine that nobody would want to work in a factory because they would rather die than work in a factory. They would rather die than watch their own children work in a factor or clean their own toilets. So they imagine that no one would want to do these things. And so they shipped manufacturing overseas and imported a slave caste.”\n\nOver half of Americans have money in the stock market, and so we shouldn’t discount the pain many people are feeling right now or the possibility that Trump’s tariffs could backfire, cause a recession, and lower living standards."
