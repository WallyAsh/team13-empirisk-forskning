US Foreign Aid Was Always About Furthering US Interests,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-27-0442/politics-us-foreign-aid-was-always-about-furthering-us-interests,Jacobin,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/jacobin-media-bias,Left,https://jacobin.com/2025/01/us-foreign-aid-imperialism-humanitarianism,"The announcement by the new Donald Trump administration to suspend foreign aid spending — approximately $68 billion annually — has sent shock waves across the world. This decision will not only affect military aid, which makes up a large percentage of the total, but also threatens funding for development aid, human rights campaigns, and initiatives that support democratic institutions — even as US foreign policy tends to undermine the stated goals of its aid. The executive order immediately raised concerns in the mainstream press about the United States neglecting its duty to Ukraine in its war with Russia and the abandonment of numerous humanitarian missions across the underdeveloped world.

The general response to this announcement, however, reinforces a long-standing false dichotomy: the notion that US and Western humanitarian and developmental interventionism operates independently of these nations’ broader, overtly aggressive geopolitical and imperialist interests. In this context, President Trump’s announcement should not be seen as an attack on the “friendlier” side of US foreign policy but rather an alignment of its outward form with its substance, unveiling the true purpose of foreign aid in serving US ruling-class interests — now all stick and no carrot.

USAID and NGOism

Alongside overt forms of domination — military interventions, territorial acquisition, direct political interference — Western powers have long developed parallel forms of intervention and control, sometimes called informal imperialism. Over the last few decades, a refinement and perfecting of these more subtle instruments of domination has sometimes partially displaced older forms. Due to its proximity to the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean have been important testing grounds for these practices.

Historically, these have involved policies such as promoting US ideology and culture with Christian missions or Hollywood blockbusters (the softest of soft imperialism), subordinating governments by covertly financing opposition political parties or presidential candidates, and the use of economic sanctions. The region has also witnessed an increasing reliance on developmental aid programs, a trend that can be traced to the advent of so-called multilateral aid initiatives led by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the mid-twentieth century. These organizations and initiatives were later used to compel nations in the Global South to adopt neoliberal policies, reinforcing their dependency on the United States and Europe.

This form of imperialism has empowered so-called civil society — nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and civil society organizations (CSOs) — in the peripheralized regions. Among them are groups concerned with poverty and inequality, human rights, and, increasingly, the ecological crisis whose humanitarian interventions have often coincided with and even legitimated neoliberal reforms.

Instrumental to the mushrooming of these organizations have been Western developmental agencies — most notably, the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the World Bank, and, more recently, the European Union’s numerous developmental aid programs. The latter actor has used the region as a testing ground for its “civilian power” approach to foreign policy since the late 1990s.

These Western developmental aid and humanitarian programs are not only fundamentally incapable of addressing the region’s severe social and ecological crises; they have also served as tools to reinforce the very structures that perpetuate these problems. Nearly a century into this model of interventionism, the historical conditions of poverty, inequality, exploitation, and oppression — the very issues these programs aim to resolve — remain intact even as new markets have been wrenched open.

The Early Laboratories of Civil Society

Like neoliberalism itself, much of this began in earnest in Chile. The US-backed military coup that overthrew the country’s socialist government in 1973 was the culmination of a more comprehensive foreign intervention that had started years earlier. Thousands of documents declassified by the US government between 1999 and 2000 confirmed the CIA’s involvement. The economic war and the military coup were the culmination of a broader effort, going as far back as the early 1960s, to keep Chile’s socialists out of power. Central to this effort was the funding and influencing of civil society groups such as trade unions, religious groups, and women’s organizations.

With Augusto Pinochet’s installation as dictator, Chile not only became a laboratory for neoliberal policies but also an important site for the deployment and development of Western-backed NGOs, particularly human rights ones. In other words, at the same time as the United States and Europe backed and facilitated Chile’s dictatorship and the brutal oppression of its population, they also played a role in its partial relief, funding human rights NGOs that performed roles as varied as denouncing the dictatorship’s abuses and providing meals for impoverished families.

As highlighted by James Petras in his extensive research on the matter, the growth of Western-backed NGOs in Latin America and the Caribbean coincided with Operation Condor, a campaign of terror against leftist leaders and movements and the installment of US-backed regimes beginning in the 1970s. By superficially alleviating some of the more obvious fallout from the installation of repressive regimes and the neoliberal economic policies they immediately adopted, these civil society organizations played the complementary role of neutralizing more organic and radical political and social movements, co-opting or weakening them and their leadership with the vast resources at their disposal.

With more significant funding from multilateral organizations like the World Bank beginning in the 1980s and, notably, from USAID and European developmental programs since the turn of the twenty-first century, these civil society groups have reproduced themselves across the region and become crucial to Western foreign policy.

Democracy According to USAID

By the 1990s, with the region’s leftist movement weakened in the aftermath of Operation Condor and former dictatorships transitioning back to electoral democracies, the West’s focus in Latin America shifted from NGOs concerned with human rights abuses to those promoting democracy and development, with the former cause increasingly integrated into the latter.

Operating in the region since its founding in the early 1960s, USAID took a stronger role in the 1990s as the friendly side of US interventionism. It poured hundreds of millions of dollars into Haiti for NGO initiatives and state-led “democratic” programs, financed microdevelopment projects in rural Paraguay to dissuade peasants from supporting insurgent groups, and countered the rapidly growing socialist movement in Bolivia through a multimillion-dollar democracy-building campaign.

This multifaceted approach to sustaining US hegemony in the region would eventually be joined and, in some countries, rivaled by other Western powers. From the early 2000s, the European Union began testing its novel civil society approach to foreign policy in war-ridden Colombia, proposing an alternative to the US-backed Plan Colombia, a hawkish counterinsurgent policy and corollary to the domestic US “war on drugs.”

But the EU’s so-called Peace Laboratories, receiving tens of millions of euros between 2002 and 2010, would, in fact, be implemented in Colombia alongside the counterinsurgency program, contributing to the weakening of revolutionary left-wing movements and their social base through, among other things, financing microdevelopmental projects that tied peasants in conflict areas to the agricultural exports industry. Moreover, as the Campaign Against Arms Trade highlighted, EU member states like the UK (then still part of the EU) and Spain contributed directly to the US-backed militarist efforts to subdue the population at the same time as the peacebuilding project.

As the United States made massive military transfers to Colombia, the EU surpassed it as the principal donor of developmental aid to Latin America and the Caribbean in the early 2000s. This developmental investment was accompanied by the intensification of trade between Latin America and Europe, which today approaches the region’s trade with the United States, facilitated further by several bloc-to-bloc free trade agreements, all of them containing normative clauses and conditions.

Though firmly aligned with violent, militaristic forms of intervention, European Union aid, USAID, and other such developmental agencies have worked in the region with relatively little scrutiny or opposition. This is largely due to the widespread assumption that their projects are inherently benevolent and a force for good.

This can be observed today in USAID’s continued allocation of millions of dollars to the region, most recently under the guise of aiding Venezuela’s migrants. It is also reflected in the World Bank’s annual loans, amounting to the tens of billions for so-called “sustainable” development programs, and the European Union’s yearly contribution of one hundred million euros in humanitarian aid — dwarfed by the approximate three hundred billion euros in goods traded annually between the EU and Latin America.

Imperialism Was Never Friendly

The contemporary practice of informal imperialism — of developmental aid and humanitarianism specifically — has become the favored form of tapping into new markets and maintaining favorable conditions for investment in the Global South. In this regard, the Western aid and NGO project in Latin America and the Caribbean has mostly been a success story.

How permanent the Trump administration’s pause in aid becomes remains to be seen. Either way, the change in foreign policy will likely face significant resistance among both state actors and capital, as such soft power has proven an effective tool in furthering imperial and ruling-class interests. For the rest of us, these troubling times present an opportunity to focus on those interests and how they’re advanced across administrations and policy regimes. This means unmasking the illusion of friendly US and European foreign policy and challenging its contempt for the world’s oppressed majorities not only when displayed openly but also when carefully concealed behind a facade of humanitarian benevolence.",Left,True
Eastern Europe's media in the crosshairs after USAID funding freeze,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-27-0440/politics-eastern-europes-media-crosshairs-after-usaid-funding-freeze,Reuters,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reuters,Center,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eastern-europes-media-crosshairs-after-usaid-funding-freeze-2025-02-13/,"Employees of the Hungarian radio station Klubradio work at its headquarters in Budapest, Hungary, February 6, 2025. REUTERS/Bernadett Szabo Employees of the Hungarian radio station Klubradio work at its headquarters in Budapest, Hungary, February 6, 2025. REUTERS/Bernadett Szabo , Summary USAID has helped fund independent media in eastern Europe Many outlets reeling from Trump actions against USAID They say loss of funds hits ability to hold power to account Hungary, Bosnia, Georgia among countries most impacted BUDAPEST/SARAJEVO, Feb 13 (Reuters) - At a Feb. 10 editorial meeting of Hungarian investigative outlet Atlatszo, journalists discussed how they might raise money after their grants from USAID intermediaries were halted amid U.S. President Donald Trump's drive to shutter the agency. ""Without these funds it would be very hard to maintain independent media here (in Hungary),"" Atlatszo's managing editor Tamas Bodoky told Reuters, adding that they would seek new donors and try to increase crowdfunding. Atlatszo, a non-profit outlet set up in 2011, has published investigations on corruption, Hungarian oligarchs close to the government and the fate of EU funds, among other issues. Bodoky said USAID indirectly financed some 10-15% of its budget in 2023 and 2024. Trump's decision - first to freeze most funds disbursed by USAID for 90 days and put most of its staff on leave and then to ask billionaire Elon Musk to scale down the agency - has caused chaos for NGOs and humanitarian projects worldwide. While the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) distributes billions of dollars of humanitarian aid, it has also been involved in many other projects, including those aimed at strengthening civil society and democracy worldwide. USAID opened , new programmes in central Europe in late 2022, supporting locally-driven initiatives to bolster democratic institutions and independent media - much to the chagrin of Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a Trump ally who has welcomed the U.S. president's moves against the agency. Although the ultimate fate of many USAID programmes remains uncertain, the Trump administration has indicated it does not see supporting journalism in countries where rights groups say press freedom is limited as a good use of U.S. public funds. ""The US radical-left has been using US taxpayer money to fund radical-left political parties & media around the world,” Musk wrote on X on January 29. Both Musk and Trump have branded USAID as ""corrupt"", without providing evidence. Trump's moves against USAID prompted Orban to say on February 7 that he wants to eliminate all ""foreign networks"" of NGOs and media critical of his government, fuelling fears that it will embolden him and other illiberal governments to enact clampdowns on media they deem to be unfriendly. ""Money from abroad cannot be allowed to influence Hungarian politics, and we shall enforce this legally, with those who are complicit in this facing legal consequences,"" said Orban, who faces a challenging election in 2026 amid a struggling economy. Orban has transformed Hungary's media landscape over the past 14 years. State media have been put under full government control and several private media outlets shut or taken over by government-friendly owners. Tight media control has helped Orban win the past three elections with a landslide. PRESS FREEDOM In 2024, Hungary ranked 67th on the World Press Freedom Index , , down from 23rd in 2010 when Orban took power, with its ranking well below that of Poland or the Czech Republic. Georgia and Bosnia - two other eastern European countries heavily impacted by Trump's efforts to dismantle USAID - ranked 103rd and 81st, respectively, for press freedom last year. The Sarajevo-based ""Umbrella"" association, a hub for 13 non-profit media involved in investigative journalism in the Balkans, is among organisations waiting to know if USAID donations will resume after Trump's 90-day financing freeze. ""If U.S. donations to media in Bosnia and Herzegovina were to be halted (permanently), some of them would be forced to reduce the scope of their work... cutting the number of serious stories about corruption, organised crime and abuse of power,"" said Umbrella director Milica Samardzic. Paulina Milewska, a researcher for the European University Institute in Florence, Italy, also cited the risk that media outlets that lose USAID funding will need to cut back on deeper coverage. While the U.S. government has long helped fund media organisations all over the world, eastern Europe has always been a major focus dating back to the Cold War, when the CIA helped establish outlets to sway public opinion against communism. Musk called on February 9 for the closure of Radio Free Europe (RFE) – which has been funded by U.S. government money separate to USAID since 1950 – saying it was a ""relic of the past"". In an emailed reply to Reuters, RFE declined to comment. After the USAID freeze, the European Federation of Journalists (EFJ) called on European institutions and foundations , to mobilise in support of media pluralism and independent journalism, saying Trump's move would cause ""chaos in the media ecosystem of over 30 countries around the world, including many European countries"". These include Georgia, where tens of thousands of people have been protesting for months against a government they see as pro-Russian and authoritarian and which has suspended negotiations to join the European Union. Among media outlets there affected by Trump's decision is English language news site OC-Media, which said it had lost funding for three USAID-backed projects. ""Without independent journalism, there will be no one to hold power to account,"" said its co-founder, Dominik Cagara.

Fired USAid workers and HIV activists hold ‘die-in’ to protest Trump and Musk,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-27-0438/politics-fired-usaid-workers-and-hiv-activists-hold-die-protest-trump-and-musk,The Guardian,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/guardian,Left,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/26/usaid-hiv-protest-trump-musk,"Fired USAid employees and advocates for people with HIV staged a protest in a Capitol office building on Wednesday, warning that Donald Trump’s drive to dismantle the agency tasked with implementing Washington’s foreign aid agenda imperils the fight against the virus.

Wearing white T-shirts that read “Aids funding cuts kill” and chanting “Congress has blood on its hands, unfreeze aid now”, around three dozen protesters lay down in the rotunda of the Cannon House office building, home to the offices of representatives from both parties. Capitol police said about 20 arrests were made of demonstrators who defied their orders to disperse.

“What we are demanding of Congress is that they stop behaving like doormats in the face of this attack on humanitarian assistance that truly is highly effective and life-saving,” Asia Russell, executive director of Health Gap, a global advocacy group fighting against HIV, said prior to the protest.

“It’s very hard to overstate what’s at stake regarding humanitarian assistance.”

The protest came as USAid remained frozen by the Trump administration’s rapid moves to close the agency. Over the weekend, the agency announced that it was placing all but a small number of its employees worldwide, as well as nearly 2,000 staffers based in the United States, on paid leave. Those working in Washington DC have been invited to retrieve their belongings from its headquarters, which is set to be turned into office space for US Customs and Border Protection, one of the agencies implementing Trump’s hardline immigration policies.

On Tuesday, a federal judge reportedly gave the government a two-day deadline to release billions of dollars in foreign aid funds that had been held back after Trump ordered USAid to stop work. If those funds are not restored, former USAid employees who attended the protest at the Capitol warned, the global fight against HIV will be set back.

The United States has been a leader in the campaign against the virus that causes Aids through Pepfar, a program that provides medication to 20 million people worldwide and was established during Republican George W Bush’s presidency. But USAid’s abrupt closure has stopped payments to providers working with the program worldwide.

“This is not controversial, and what is happening is not government efficiency, it’s government fraud, waste and abuse when it comes to what Doge is doing,” said the fired USAid contractor Van Credle, referring to Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency”, which spearheaded the dismantling of her agency as well as other deep cuts to federal services.

The Republican majorities elected to both the Senate and House last November have thus far shown little interest in saving USAid and even supported its closure, despite the fact that foreign assistance has in the past enjoyed support on both sides of the aisle. Kelsey Crow, a contractor at the agency’s bureau of global health who lost her job, said the protest was meant to encourage lawmakers who previously supported USAid to step up.

“So much of our work at USAid is mandated by Congress, and so for Congress to not be taking action, for Congress to be holding hearings that are pushing out lies and falsehoods about USAid to say that the waivers are back when we know that they’re actually not turned on and the money’s not actually flowing, it’s incredibly disappointing,” Crow said.

Peter Kerndt, a physician who spent five years with USAid coordinating the fight against tuberculosis in African and Asian countries, said it will be “impossible” to achieve a global goal of eliminating the virus by 2030 if the agency goes away.

“For this administration, for Elon Musk to call USAid a criminal organization that should die and to gleefully celebrate that he spent the weekend putting USAid in the wood chipper instead of going to a party is such an insult to all of the workers, both here and in the country,” he said. “But most of all, the people that suffer are the people that we were there to help.”

Trump administration says it’s cutting 90% of USAID foreign aid contracts,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-27-0436/politics-trump-administration-says-it-s-cutting-90-usaid-foreign-aid-contracts,Associated Press,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/associated-press-media-bias,Left,https://apnews.com/article/trump-usaid-foreign-aid-cuts-6292f48f8d4025bed0bf5c3e9d623c16,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration said it is eliminating more than 90% of the U.S. Agency for International Development’s foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall U.S. assistance around the world, putting numbers on its plans to eliminate the majority of U.S. development and humanitarian help abroad.

The cuts detailed by the administration would leave few surviving USAID projects for advocates to try to save in what are ongoing court battles with the administration.

The Trump administration outlined its plans in both an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press and filings in one of those federal lawsuits Wednesday.

The Supreme Court intervened in that case late Wednesday and temporarily blocked a court order requiring the administration to release billions of dollars in foreign aid by midnight.

Wednesday’s disclosures also give an idea of the scale of the administration’s retreat from U.S. aid and development assistance overseas, and from decades of U.S. policy that foreign aid helps U.S. interests by stabilizing other countries and economies and building alliances.

The memo said officials were “clearing significant waste stemming from decades of institutional drift.” More changes are planned in how USAID and the State Department deliver foreign assistance, it said, “to use taxpayer dollars wisely to advance American interests.”

President Donald Trump and ally Elon Musk have hit foreign aid harder and faster than almost any other target in their push to cut the size of the federal government. Both men say USAID projects advance a liberal agenda and are a waste of money.

Trump on Jan. 20 ordered what he said would be a 90-day program-by-program review of which foreign assistance programs deserved to continue, and cut off all foreign assistance funds almost overnight.

The funding freeze has stopped thousands of U.S.-funded programs abroad, and the administration and Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency teams have pulled the majority of USAID staff off the job through forced leave and firings.

Widely successful USAID programs credited with containing outbreaks of Ebola and other threats and saving more than 20 million lives in Africa through HIV and AIDS treatment are among those still cut off from agency funds, USAID officials and officials with partner organizations say. Meanwhile, formal notifications of program cancellations are rolling out.

In the federal court filings Wednesday, nonprofits owed money on contracts with USAID describe both Trump political appointees and members of Musk’s teams terminating USAID’s contracts around the world at breakneck speed, without time for any meaningful review, they say.

“‘There are MANY more terminations coming, so please gear up!’'' a USAID official wrote staff Monday, in an email quoted by lawyers for the nonprofits in the filings.

The nonprofits, among thousands of contractors, owed billions of dollars in payment since the freeze began, called the en masse contract terminations a maneuver to get around complying with the order to lift the funding freeze temporarily.

So did a Democratic lawmaker.

The administration was attempting to “blow through Congress and the courts by announcing the completion of their sham ‘review’ of foreign aid and the immediate termination of thousands of aid programs all over the world,” said Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

A coalition representing major U.S. and global businesses and nongovernmental organizations and former officials expressed shock at the move. “The American people deserve a transparent accounting of what will be lost — on counterterror, global health, food security, and competition,” the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition said.

The State Department said Secretary of State Marco Rubio had reviewed the terminations.

In all, the Trump administration said it will eliminate 5,800 of 6,200 multiyear USAID contract awards, for a cut of $54 billion. Another 4,100 of 9,100 State Department grants were being eliminated, for a cut of $4.4 billion.

The State Department memo, which was first reported by the Washington Free Beacon, described the administration as spurred by a federal court order that gave officials until the end of the day Wednesday to lift the Trump administration’s monthlong block on foreign aid funding.

“In response, State and USAID moved rapidly,” targeting USAID and State Department foreign aid programs in vast numbers for contract terminations, the memo said.

Trump administration officials — after repeated warnings from the federal judge in the case — also said Wednesday they were finally beginning to send out their first or any payments after more than a month with no known spending. Officials were processing a few million dollars of back payments, officials said, owed to U.S. and international organizations and companies.

But U.S. District Judge Amir H. Ali’s order to unfreeze billions of dollars by midnight Wednesday will remain on hold until the Supreme Court has a chance to weigh in more fully, according to the brief order signed by Chief Justice John Roberts.

Ali had ordered the federal government to comply with his decision temporarily blocking a freeze on foreign aid, ruling in a lawsuit filed by nonprofit groups and businesses. An appellate panel refused the administration’s request to intervene before the high court weighed in.

The plaintiffs have until noon Friday to respond, Roberts said.

The administration has filed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court in one other case so far, arguing that a lower court was wrong to reinstate the head of a federal watchdog agency after Trump fired him.

AG Pam Bondi says some Epstein files coming Thursday: 'It's pretty sick',https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-27-0317/justice-ag-pam-bondi-says-some-epstein-files-coming-thursday-its-pretty-sick,Fox News Digital,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/fox-news-media-bias,Far Right,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ag-pam-bondi-says-some-epstein-files-coming-thursday-its-pretty-sick,"Attorney General Pam Bondi made an explosive revelation on Wednesday when she told Jesse Watters on ""Jesse Watters Primetime"" that some information about Jeffrey Epstein would be released by the Department of Justice (DOJ) on Thursday.

She told Watters there are over 250 alleged victims, and her office needs to ensure all of their identities are protected.

""What you’re going to see, hopefully tomorrow, is a lot of flight logs, a lot of names, a lot of information,"" Bondi said when asked about the type of information that will be released Thursday. ""But, it’s pretty sick what that man did, along with his co-defendant.""

Bondi's revelation comes after Republican lawmakers pressed the Department of Justice (DOJ) for the release of classified documents and records related to Jeffrey Epstein and the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, among other federal secrets, received a response, though it fell a bit flat.

GOPERS PRESS FOR THE RELEASE OF JFK, EPSTEIN FILES: HERE'S WHY THEY'RE NOT OUT

President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month calling on agencies to create plans to release and distribute top-secret documents, including those pertaining to the assassinations of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King.

Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., is leading the House Oversight Committee’s Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, and, after sending letters to the DOJ Feb. 11 and Feb. 19, said she finally heard back.

""My office just received a formal response from the DOJ on the Jeffrey Epstein, JFK, MLK, & RFK files,"" Luna wrote in a post on X, attaching a copy of the letter.

In the letter, the DOJ thanked Luna for the two letters, in which she requested briefings and any documents in the department’s possession relating to the classified investigations.

The DOJ also acknowledged Luna’s request for written confirmation of the date and location of the release of those records.

""The integrity of criminal investigations and prosecutions is essential to every component of the Department’s mission to uphold the rule of law, keep our nation safe, and protect civil rights,"" Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Patrick D. Davis wrote.

""The Department remains committed to meeting its legal recordkeeping obligations as it pursues that mission. We are reviewing your requests and look forward to engaging further to accommodate your oversight and legislative needs.

""We hope this information is helpful,"" Davis added. ""Please do not hesitate to contact this office if we may provide additional assistance regarding this or any other matter.""

ANNA PAULINA LUNA TO LEAD TASK FORCE ON DECLASSIFICATION OF JFK ASSASSINATION RECORDS, EPSTEIN CLIENT LIST

The response came two days after Luna said she had faced silence from the DOJ.

""On Feb 11 & Feb 19, house oversight sent a letter to the DOJ asking for status on releasing the Epstein files as well as JFK etc.,"" Luna said in a post on X Monday. ""The DOJ has not responded. Reaching out on X because we can’t seem to get a response from the AG. @AGPamBondi what is the status of the documents? These documents were ordered to be declassified.""

Luna also sent a letter to Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Attorney General Pam Bondi, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz and White House Counsel David Warrington requesting a briefing by Thursday on plans for the release of the documents.

TRUMP SIGNS ORDER TO DECLASSIFY FILES ON JFK, RFK AND MLK ASSASSINATIONS

Trump’s executive order instructed the Department of Justice to coordinate with Gabbard, Waltz and Warrington to establish a plan by Feb. 7 for the release of the JFK files and to create a plan for the release of the MLK and Robert F. Kennedy files by March 9.

Additionally, Luna is pushing the Justice Department to share details regarding Jeffrey Epstein’s client list. The American financier died in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

"FTC crashes FCC party in threats against Big Tech for censorship in tug-of-war with Europe, Brazil",https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-27-0315/free-speech-ftc-crashes-fcc-party-threats-against-big-tech-censorship-tug-war,Just The News,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/just-news-media-bias,Lean Right,https://justthenews.com/nation/free-speech/ftc-crashes-fcc-party-threats-against-big-tech-censorship-tug-war-europe-brazil,"Like a child custody battle in a throuple, U.S. tech companies are getting pulled in three directions as the Trump administration abandons its predecessor's tacit tolerance, if not always explicit approval, for official censorship in the European Union and Brazil.

The Federal Trade Commission joined the Federal Communications Commission in pressuring Big Tech to back off content moderation that allegedly suppresses conservative speech and challenges to establishment narratives compared to other speech, an evolution of the agencies' history of turf wars on internet policy issues.

President Trump issued another sweeping executive order Friday that includes investigating and countering U.K. and EU policies that may have ""the effect of requiring or incentivizing the use or development"" of U.S.-made products and services ""in ways that undermine freedom of speech and political engagement or otherwise moderate content.""

Trump Media and Technology Group, home of the president's Truth Social, and video platform Rumble also got a reprieve from a federal court in their lawsuit against Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes for his censorship orders.

U.S. District Judge Mary Scriven, nominated by President George W. Bush, ruled that Moraes didn't follow the Hague Convention or the countries' Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty in issuing his orders, so the plaintiffs didn't need a temporary restraining order to stop him.

""Censorship by technology platforms is not just un-American, it is potentially illegal,"" the FTC said, issuing a request for information that seeks public comment on consumer harm from ""potentially unfair or deceptive acts or practices, or potentially unfair methods of competition,"" and specifically input from ""current and former employees of technology platforms.""

It asks for circumstances under which platforms have shadowbanned and demonetized users based on their speech and affiliations, what their ""public-facing representations"" said about moderation and whether users could appeal sanctions, what influenced such adverse actions and how they may have been enabled by lack of competition or weakened competition.

""Tech firms should not be bullying their users"" into silencing themselves based on viewpoint, said FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson, who was first appointed to the commission by President Biden and confirmed by the Senate less than a year ago.

Roughly 1,000 comments had already been filed by Wednesday afternoon in a proceeding that runs through May 21, many without real names and either critical of the proceeding or implying President Trump and X owner Elon Musk are the real threat to free speech.

""The Trumpsters are censoring our ability to say Gulf of Mexico, he//him, etc.,"" commenter ""Andrew Ferguson"" wrote, referring to Trump's tiff with the Associated Press over the renamed ""Gulf of America"" and reported ban on federal employees listing their gender pronouns.

It appears to be the Trump FTC's first confirmed shot across the bow at Big Tech, arriving late to the party started by cell tower-climbing FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, dubbed a Trump ""sycophant"" by House Judiciary Committee Ranking Democrat Jamie Raskin for reinstating complaints against broadcast networks for their election coverage decisions including editing.

Less than two weeks after the election, Trump-nominated Commissioner Carr said the ""censorship cartel"" that silenced Americans, with help from an ""Orwellian"" purported fact-checker, ""must be dismantled and destroyed.""

In letters to Google and Facebook parent companies as well as Microsoft and Apple, Carr said their work with NewsGuard, a rating system for news and information websites, might not be in ""good faith,"" the condition for legal immunity under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.

Apple also has to fend off increasing attacks from conservative rabble-rousers.

It defeated four resolutions at its annual shareholder meeting this week including transparency on how it fights child sexual abuse material and its relationships with activists such as the Human Rights Campaign, which requires companies to pay for so-called gender affirming care for minors to perform well on its Corporate Equality Index.

The Alliance Defending Freedom, which helped lead the shareholder efforts, called it a win because ""this is the beginning of a conversation,"" in the words of Senior Vice President of corporate engagement Jeremy Tedesco.

""Apple has budged"" in response to their resolution against diversity, equity and inclusion ""and I think there's more budging to be done,"" Bowyer Research President Jerry Bowyer said, noting that Apple CEO Tim Cook suggested that legal changes may force it to recant DEI.

The FCC's Carr is a long-term skeptic of the breadth of Section 230 immunity as determined by courts, cheering President Biden's interest in ""removing Big Tech’s special Section 230 protections"" in 2022 while suggesting ways to avoid ""encouraging even more censorship.""

New York Post business columnist Charles Gasparino said investors should prepare for Big Tech stocks tanking if Carr's ""inchoate"" plan for Section 230 regulatory review gets fleshed out as an advisory opinion that weakens or eliminates the liability shield on the grounds that platforms are no longer ""blind arbiter[s] of information.""

Gasparino sees a ""good chance"" many courts, especially with conservative jurists, will rely on FCC guidance in Section 230 cases, giving new life to defamation claims against Big Tech, granting expensive legal discovery and prompting settlements.

The columnist buttressed his take by pointing to Section 230 caselaw in Silicon Valley's 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which most recently stripped immunity from Facebook in a class-action lawsuit against its algorithm discerning users' protected characteristics and letting advertisers discriminate in whom they target with housing ads based on those characteristics.

Carr confirmed Big Tech scrutiny will be a hallmark of his chairmanship by hiring law professor Adam Candeub, long a vocal critic of Section 230 as interpreted by courts, as general counsel of the agency, the position Carr held before his elevation to commissioner.

Carr also praised Trump's nomination of ex-FTC lawyer Gail Slater, onetime policy chief for the since-disbanded Internet Association, as Justice Department antitrust division chief, who will ""help rein in Big Tech and put an end to their abusive and anticompetitive practices.""

The FTC and DOJ have their own history of turf wars, and Ferguson told staff last week he wanted the two ""singing from the same song sheet"" when it comes to merger reviews. He said it's better to keep the Biden administration's joint 2023 guidelines rather than spark a ""recriminatory cycle of partisan rescissions"" that harm business and confuse courts.

The first-month moves by the Trump-appointed chairmen coincide with the president's Feb. 18 executive order to exert more control over the FTC, FCC and Securities and Exchange Commission, which the order calls ""so-called independent agencies"" whose economy-straining rules and regulations have long escaped direct presidential review.",Lean Right,True
US Supreme Court Roberts pauses federal judge's order on Trump administration foreign aid funding,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-27-0314/supreme-court-us-supreme-court-roberts-pauses-federal-judges-order-trump,Reuters,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reuters,Center,https://www.reuters.com/legal/trump-administration-says-it-cannot-meet-court-deadline-foreign-aid-payments-2025-02-26/,"Summary Plaintiffs say Trump actions violate US law, Constitution Administration had asked US Supreme Court to intervene WASHINGTON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on Wednesday paused a federal judge's order requiring President Donald Trump 's administration to pay foreign aid funds to contractors and grant recipients. Roberts issued an interim order placing on hold Washington-based U.S. District Judge Amir Ali's action that had imposed a deadline of 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday night. Roberts provided no rationale for the order, known as an administrative stay, which will give the court additional time to consider the administration's more formal request to block Ali's ruling. Roberts asked for a response from the plaintiffs - organizations that contract with or receive grants from the U.S. Agency for International Development and the State Department - by noon on Friday. The order came after Trump's administration said in a court filing on Wednesday it had made final decisions terminating most U.S. foreign aid contracts and grants, while maintaining that it cannot meet Ali's court-ordered deadline. The administration is cutting more than 90% of the U.S. Agency for International Development's foreign aid contracts and over $58 billion in overall U.S. assistance around the world, a State Department spokesperson said separately, calling the cuts part of Trump's ""America First agenda."" The foreign aid funding dispute arose from a pair of lawsuits brought by the aid organizations, alleging that the agencies have illegally frozen all foreign aid payments. The Trump administration has kept those payments largely frozen despite a February 13 temporary restraining order from Ali that they be released, and multiple subsequent orders that the administration comply, culminating in the Wednesday night deadline. Lawyers for the U.S. Justice Department have maintained that the administration has a right to suspend its agreements while it reviews them to determine whether they comply with administration policy. That review is now complete, the administration said in its new filing. It said USAID has made final decisions to cancel nearly 5,800 awards, while keeping more than 500, and that the State Department has canceled about 4,100 awards, while keeping about 2,700. An administration official said in an earlier court filing that grounds for terminating contracts include that they were related to diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility efforts, or were deemed wasteful. Trump has taken a hard line on programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion, signing an executive order in his second day in office last month directing federal agency chiefs to dismantle DEI policies . An American flag and USAID flag fly outside the USAID building in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 1, 2025. REUTERS/Annabelle Gordon/File Photo , The administration said on Wednesday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had ordered that past-due invoices from the plaintiffs for work before January 24, when the payment freeze began, to be ""expedited for payment without the ordinary vetting procedures, in a good-faith effort to comply"" with Ali's order. It said that while some money would be paid on Wednesday, full payments could take weeks. FUNDING FREEZE UNDERMINES RELIEF EFFORTS Trump, a Republican, ordered a 90-day pause on all foreign aid on his first day in office last month. That order, and ensuing stop-work orders halting USAID operations around the world, have jeopardized the delivery of life-saving food and medical aid, throwing global humanitarian relief efforts into chaos . USAID administers some 60% of U.S. foreign assistance and disbursed $43.79 billion in fiscal 2023. According to a Congressional Research Service report this month, its workforce of 10,000, of which about two-thirds serves overseas, assisted about 130 countries. Trump's administration on Sunday said it was placing all but leaders and critical staff at USAID on paid administrative leave and eliminating 1,600 positions . Employee unions have sued to challenge the cuts, though a judge last week allowed them to go ahead . Ali, who was appointed by Trump's Democratic predecessor, former President Joe Biden, issued his temporary restraining order to prevent irreparable harm to the plaintiffs while he considers their claims. The plaintiffs allege Trump has exceeded his authority under federal law and the U.S. Constitution by effectively dismantling an independent agency and canceling spending authorized by Congress. The plaintiffs have said the administration has not done anything to comply with the restraining order, and some have said they will shut down within days if they are not paid. ""The lengths that the government is willing to go to flout a court order, all for the goal of ending life-saving humanitarian assistance, is staggering,"" said Allison Zieve, a lawyer representing two plaintiffs, AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and Journalism Development Network, on Wednesday. Other plaintiffs include international development company DAI Global and refugee assistance organization HIAS. Both Ali and a Rhode Island federal judge in a separate case over a broader federal payment freeze have castigated the Trump administration for failing to follow their orders. The administration in both cases has maintained it is trying in good faith to interpret and comply with the orders.

"Trump threatens to slap 25% tariffs on EU, says bloc was always meant to hurt the U.S.",https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-27-0312/donald-trump-trump-threatens-slap-25-tariffs-eu-says-bloc-was-always-meant-hurt,CNBC,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnbc,Center,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/27/trump-threatens-25percent-tariffs-on-eu-says-bloc-formed-to-screw-us.html,"U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose 25% tariffs on imports from the European Union, claiming that the economic and political bloc was formed ""to screw"" the U.S.

The White House leader signaled the potential trade measures on Wednesday, during the first Cabinet meeting of his second term in office — a day before he announced that another set of proposed levies on Mexico and Canada will go into effect on March 4, noting that China will be charged an additional 10% tariff on the same date.

""We'll be announcing it very soon,"" he told reporters of the EU measures on Wednesday. ""It'll be [a] 25% [tariff] generally speaking, and that will be on cars and all other things.""

He added, ""They've really taken advantage of us ... They don't accept our cars, they don't accept, essentially, our farm products. They use all sorts of reasons why not. And we accept everything of them.""

The president has made it a priority to tackle what he sees as unfair trade relationships with a number of the U.S.' closest neighbors and trading partners, citing the U.S.' persistent trade deficits — in which it imports more goods and services than it exports — as evidence of this.

Trump claimed, without citing evidence, that the EU had been formed to undermine the U.S.

""I love the countries of Europe. I guess I'm from there at some point, a long time ago, right? ... But [the] European Union was formed in order to screw the United States ... that's the purpose of it, and they've done a good job of it. But now I'm president,"" he said.

The EU was established after the 1993 enforcement of the Maastricht Treaty, building on post-war sentiment of European unity and cites establishing an internal market and achieving sustainable development among its aims.

Reacting to Trump's claims about the EU's origin, the Commission noted that the EU had benefitted the U.S.

""The European Union is the world's largest free market. And it has been a boon for the United States. By creating a large and integrated single market, the EU has facilitated trade, reduced costs for U.S. exporters, and harmonized standards and regulations across 27 countries. As a result, U.S. investments in Europe are highly profitable,"" the Commission said in a statement to CNBC.

The EU urged the U.S. to work with it ""to preserve these opportunities for our people and businesses. Not against each other.""

The tariffs prospect is not new, with Trump having already threatened the EU and U.K. with levies. The White House leader had nevertheless previously signaled that a deal could be worked out with Britain, which has a much more balanced trading relationship with the U.S.

Biden Justice Department downplayed U.K. demand for Apple ‘back door’,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-27-0311/joe-biden-biden-justice-department-downplayed-uk-demand-apple-back-door,Washington Post,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/washington-post-media-bias,Lean Left,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/26/intelligence-chief-tulsi-gabbard-will-fight-egregious-apple-back-door-order/,"The U.S. Justice Department told Congress in November that there were no major disputes with the United Kingdom over how the two allies seek data from each other’s communication companies.

But at that time, officials knew British authorities were preparing a demand that Apple build a back door to its users’ encrypted data, according to people familiar with the process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal department matters.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on Tuesday called that British demand an “egregious” violation of American rights, and on Wednesday lawmakers asked the Justice Department to investigate.

November’s report to Congress was required by law to renew an agreement that lets the U.K. obtain electronic data from U.S. providers without going through U.S. courts. In it, the Biden Justice Department certified that U.K. laws and procedures provided “robust substantive and procedural protections for privacy and civil liberties.”

Advertisement

Sen. Alex Padilla and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, both California Democrats, asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to reexamine that finding, saying Britain’s threat to compromise encryption violated the information-sharing deal between the two countries under the 2018 Cloud Act.

“No entity, foreign or domestic, should be able to make Americans’ data more susceptible to breaches,” Padilla said. “That’s why we are demanding accountability, not just from other countries, but from the Department of Justice, which has the responsibility to keep Americans’ data safe — we must not set this terrible precedent.”

The U.K. ordered Apple in January to create a way for British authorities to obtain content that Apple users store in iCloud with Advanced Data Protection, an encryption option rolled out worldwide two years ago. That content is end-to-end encrypted, meaning only the user, and not Apple, can access it. Apple withdrew the encryption option in the U.K. on Friday rather than comply, an action that would have left its users with less security than they had been promised.

The Justice Department’s 10-page report to the Foreign Relations and Judiciary committees of the House and Senate noted that unnamed U.S. companies had complained that the U.K. Investigatory Powers Act required advance notice if they wanted to enhance privacy or security in their services and that Britain could then block those offerings globally.

The department said it reminded its British counterpart of the Cloud Act’s “requirement that the terms of the Agreement shall not create any obligation that providers be capable of decrypting data.” The report did not mention the looming order, and said any demands for reduced security would come under Britain’s Investigatory Powers Act, and so were not within the scope of the Cloud Act.

The Justice Department official who conveyed that document to Congress referred questions Wednesday to a department spokeswoman, who said she had nothing to add to the report.

On Wednesday, Padilla and Lofgren faulted the November certification, saying “it splits the finest of hairs” by suggesting that the Cloud Act didn’t apply to any decryption order. The two lawmakers, who sit on the Judiciary committees in their respective chambers of Congress, asked Bondi to reconsider whether Britain was violating the Cloud Act by ordering a break to Apple’s encryption.

Two of the people familiar with the certification process said the FBI has pursued backdoor capabilities unsuccessfully in the United States and would have been in a stronger legal position to win that if Apple had already had to create such a mechanism for another government.

The FBI did not respond to a request for a comment. The U.K. Home Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment and has previously said it does not comment on “operational matters.”

Gabbard on Tuesday wrote to Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Arizona) saying she had directed a legal review of the order and had not known of it before it was reported by The Washington Post and confirmed by other publications. The legislators had urged her to act just after her confirmation as the top U.S. intelligence leader.

“I share your grave concern about the serious implications of the United Kingdom, or any foreign country, requiring Apple or any company to create a ‘backdoor’ that would allow access to Americans’ personal encrypted data,” she wrote. “This would be a clear and egregious violation of Americans’ privacy and civil liberties, and open up a serious vulnerability for cyber exploitation by adversarial actors.”

Apple was prohibited from disclosing the order to Congress or U.S. regulators under the Investigatory Powers Act, which allows British officials to compel communications and technology providers to assist in government inquiries.

While not addressing the existence of the order, when Apple said it was pulling the secure storage from U.K. customers it added that it had never built a back door into its products and never would.

Even the U.K. pullout would not be enough to end the U.K. demand that the tech giant create the back door for spying on those in other countries. Gabbard’s complaints might do that, and she pledged to keep Congress apprised.

The Cloud Act cooperative agreement bars the British from deliberately seeking information on Americans, but forcing the creation of a universal back door would create a new target not just for law enforcement officials, but also for hackers and spies.

“Any information sharing between a government — any government — and private companies must be done in a manner that respects and protects the U.S. law and the Constitutional rights of U.S. citizens,” Gabbard wrote. “I look forward to ensuring the UK government has taken necessary actions to protect the privacy of American citizens, consistent with the CLOUD Act and other applicable laws.”

U.K. officials and the FBI have complained that the increasing use of end-to-end encryption has stymied investigations into terrorism, child abuse and other serious crimes. Such communications can only be seen by the sending and receiving devices. Apple’s Advanced Data Protection, iMessages and FaceTime are end-to-end encrypted, as are Google Android backups and some chats, Meta’s Messenger and WhatsApp texts, and content sent over Signal.

While acknowledging that strong encryption is used by criminals, the vast majority of security professionals and government cyber defenders have endorsed increased adoption as hackers win access to regular emails, text and voice calls.

“Director Gabbard is right to raise alarm over the UK’s demand for backdoor access to Apple users’ encrypted data,” said Kia Hamadanchy, senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. “While this might be a British government demand, it will have huge consequences for anyone in the U.S. with an iPhone.”",Center,False

While one survey by LendingClub found that more than 60% of Americans reported living paycheck to paycheck, others recorded lower numbers. LendingClub asked 3,252 U.S. consumers if they needed their next paycheck to cover their monthly spending; 62% answered yes.

In contrast, the Federal Reserve found that 54% of Americans have emergency savings to cover three months of expenses. Bankrate found that while 59% of Americans are uncomfortable with their level of emergency savings, 34% are living paycheck to paycheck.

The lack of consensus may be explained by the ambiguity of the term “paycheck to paycheck.” For example, almost half of Americans surveyed by Bank of America said they were living paycheck to paycheck but only a quarter spent 95% of their income on necessities.

"With White House visit, U.K.’s Starmer to have a go at persuading Trump",https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-26-1248/donald-trump-white-house-visit-uk-s-starmer-have-go-persuading-trump,Washington Post,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/washington-post-media-bias,Lean Left,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/26/keir-starmer-trump-white-house/,"LONDON — In almost every way, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will walk into the White House on Thursday as an alien in President Donald Trump’s MAGA universe: a former human rights lawyer, a onetime top prosecutor and, after vanquishing Conservatives in elections last summer, the United Kingdom’s most liberal leader in more than a decade.

Starmer arrives already in the crosshairs of Trump adviser Elon Musk, who has derided him on social media as a warrior of wokeism leading Britain toward inevitable civil war (not to mention being “complicit” in mass pedophilia).

But Starmer is betting the future of U.S.-U.K. relations on milder first words from Trump himself. The president said last month that he had a good relationship with Starmer and, while they differed on “philosophy,” that the Labour Party leader who took office in July had done “a very good job so far.”

Advertisement

Which reception he finds, as Trump continues to upend transatlantic relations, will help determine how Britain — and Europe — navigates the insurgent president’s upheavals in trade, disparagement of NATO and abrupt lurch toward Russia in the three-year-old war in Ukraine.

“It’s a pretty defining moment, which Trump he meets and how it goes down,” said a British official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to publicly discuss internal deliberations. “What happens over the next few weeks will determine how Keir is viewed as a world leader and how the relationship evolves.”

Starmer will be battling not just for Britain’s standing in Trump’s Washington, but Europe’s, as well. The prime minister has offered himself as a bridge between the White House and Continental capitals reeling from the president’s threats to unwind four generations of American security backing to such a degree that Germany’s presumptive next chancellor said NATO could be finished in its current form by the summer.

Advertisement

Like other leaders, Starmer approaches the mercurial Trump by trying to walk a line between agreeable and acquiescent, flattery and fealty.

Starmer told Parliament on Tuesday that his government would fast-track a hike in defense spending to reach 2.5 percent of GDP by 2027 — an additional 13.4 billion pounds, or $17 billion a year, that would put Britain on a path to 3 percent in the coming years, the prime minister said. The spike is in line with Trump’s demand that NATO members spend more on their own defense and rely less on Washington’s military might.

And in cutting Britain’s modest foreign aid budget to help fund the military boost, Starmer echoed priorities set by Trump, who spent his first weeks in office dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development.

On Ukraine, the prime minister praised the president’s head-spinning about-face in favor of Russia for shaking up the conversation and creating new opportunities for ending the war. He pledged British troops as part of a potential international force sent to help secure a negotiated peace.

Advertisement

But Starmer shows flashes of defiance. He has insisted that Ukraine and Europe must not be sidelined in talks with Russia and that U.S. backing will be “vital” for any multinational security force. Starmer insists that Ukraine remain a candidate for NATO membership, a possibility ruled off-the-table by Trump’s defense secretary.

And Starmer rejected outright Trump’s depiction of Ukraine as the aggressor and President Volodymyr Zelensky as a “dictator,” leading a chorus of support for Zelensky that stretched across Britain’s political spectrum. On Monday, Britain announced more than 100 new sanctions against Russia, its largest wave of injunctions since the early days of the invasion.

Starmer will file into the Oval Office three days after French President Emmanuel Macron. Starmer and Macron, who is driving the push for European countries to commit troops to a Ukraine security force, are coordinating their Trump strategies, aides said.

“Our efforts are convergent, concordant and complementary,” said an Elysée official, speaking on the condition of anonymity in line with French government protocol.

In Britain, the question is whether Starmer, with a personality more technocratic than colorful, will be able to show flashes of the bro-bonhomie that have enlivened Macron’s up-and-down relations with Trump.

Starmer is known for his methodical, some would say ruthless, rise through the ranks of Labour. Without much in the way of oratory or ideology, he deposed his more liberal boss Jeremy Corbyn and dragged the party to the center. Last year, he ended 14 years of Conservative rule with a relentless focus on delivering competent government and “change.”

Rarely does he show strong reactions to the inevitable personal attacks that come with politics, a flatness that may serve him well in dealings with Team Trump.

He initially waved away Musk’s charge last month that he was “complicit in the rape of Britain” for allegedly failing as a crown prosecutor to investigate immigrant gangs accused of grooming and assaulting girls. Only after the story continued to build did Starmer publicly condemn the charges as “lies” and detail his successful prosecutions against the gangs.

“Keir is absolutely unflappable, he’s levelheaded,” said Josh Simons, a Labour member of Parliament. “That makes him unusually well suited in terms of his temperament to be a bridge between Trump and Europe.”

There is a long history of Britain trying — with varying success — to be a conduit between the United States and Europe. Some American and British leaders have hit it off; others less so.

Margaret Thatcher once said that Ronald Reagan was “the second-most important man” in her life after her husband. Barack Obama looked to the continent for his “closest ally,” which is how he described German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Still, it’s hard to imagine Starmer and Trump sharing the personal chemistry of Tony Blair and Bill Clinton, said Rob Ford, a politics expert at the University of Manchester.

“They aren’t going to ever be golfing buddies,” Ford said. “But that’s not what’s being asked of him. Starmer is the kind of politician who will do whatever it takes in order to win, and winning in this case means having influence with the U.S. and being a bridge with Europe.”

Other transatlantic experts said it would be a mistake to rely on outdated nostalgia for past heydays of a “special relationship” with Washington.

Trump may have more of a soft spot for Britain than Musk does, with the golf courses he owns in Scotland and a known fondness for royal family pomp (an invitation to visit King Charles at Balmoral Castle is already in the works, according to British media reports).

But Trump’s early actions suggest he is less likely than ever to be flattered off his drive to remake Western alliances, said Tim Bale, a politics professor at Queen Mary University of London. Trump “is going to do what he wants to do, whether Starmer sucks up to him or not.”

DOGE Quietly Deletes the 5 Biggest Spending Cuts It Celebrated Last Week,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-26-1038/banking-and-finance-doge-quietly-deletes-5-biggest-spending-cuts-it-celebrated,New York Times (News),https://www.allsides.com/news-source/new-york-times,Lean Left,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/upshot/doge-spending-cuts-changed.html,"Last week, Elon Musk’s government cost-slashing initiative, which he calls the Department of Government Efficiency, posted an online “wall of receipts,” celebrating how much it had saved by canceling federal contracts.

Now the organization, which is also known as the U.S. DOGE Service, has deleted all of the five biggest “savings” on that original list, after The New York Times and other media outlets pointed out they were riddled with errors.

The last of the original top five disappeared from the site in the early hours of Tuesday, even as the group claimed in its latest update that its savings to date had increased to $65 billion. The website offered no explanation for why it had removed some items or how it had arrived at the higher total. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, sent a written statement that did not address the deletions, but provided a broader defense of the cost-cutting initiative, saying it “has already identified billions of dollars in savings.”

The “wall of receipts” is the only public ledger the organization has produced to document its work. The scale of that ledger’s errors — and the misunderstandings and poor quality control that seemed to underlie them — has raised questions about the effort’s broader work, which has led to mass firings and cutbacks across the federal government.",Center,False

Zoom in:Agencies must submit what the administration is calling ""Phase 1 Agency RIF and Reorganization Plans"" by March 13.
By the numbers:There are about 2.3 million federal employees (not including the postal service). Thousands have recently been fired.
There are exemptionsfor postal workers, military personnel, political appointees and positions ""necessary to meet law enforcement, border security, national security, immigration enforcement, or public safety responsibilities,"" per the guidance.
The rationale, the memo explains,is to consolidate duplicative functions and management layers, reduce ""non-critical"" positions, and implement technology that automates routine tasks.
Between the lines:Agency heads are directed to collaborate with the Department of Government Efficiency on these plans.

"After decades of change, the U.S. religious landscape has stabilized. Will it last?",https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-26-1028/religion-and-faith-after-decades-change-us-religious-landscape-has-stabilized,Deseret News,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/deseret-news,Center,https://www.deseret.com/faith/2025/02/26/is-religion-dying-religious-landscape-research/,"We’ve been telling ourselves the wrong story about Christianity in the United States.

Since surveys began showing a surge in nonreligious adults in the mid-1990s, many have assumed the Christian population was headed downhill with no brakes.

Organized religion was out of favor, “none of the above” was in, and houses of worship across the country were too busy dealing with aging congregations and rising building costs to find successful ways to bring new people in.

To be clear, the U.S. Christian population did indeed shrink over the past 30 years, but a major new religion survey shows the trend line unexpectedly leveled off around 2019.

For the past five years, the share of U.S. adults who identify as Christian has hovered between 60% and 64%, while the share who identify as unaffiliated has similarly stalled around 29%, according to Pew Research Center.

Many questions remain about whether this recent stabilization is sustainable, but religion scholars say we should be ready for more plot twists.

“I was quite surprised by the data, but in a broader sense, I wasn’t surprised,” said John C. Green, a political scientist at the University of Akron who consulted with Pew on the new study. “I’m always expecting the unexpected. That’s what it means to be in a dynamic religious landscape.”

Religious change in the U.S.

Pew’s new Religious Landscape Study offers an in-depth, authoritative look at religion in the U.S.

Think of it like a census focused on faith and spirituality, instead of your household makeup.

The latest survey, which was fielded in 2023 and 2024, builds on reports from 2007 and 2014. Not all questions from each report can be directly compared, but researchers built a variety of trend lines.

In summarizing those trends during a Feb. 19 press briefing, Greg Smith, the senior associate director of research at Pew, spoke about two different time periods.

Over the long term, organized religion has experienced a broad-based decline. The Christian share of the population fell from 78% in 2007 to 62% in the new study, while the unaffiliated share surged from 16% to 29% over the same 17-year period.

But in the short term, the numbers have held pretty steady, especially when compared to data collected from 2007 to 2019.

“After many years of decline, it’s striking … to have observed this recent period of stability,"" said Smith, who worked on all three religious landscape studies.

The recent stabilization stems from two key factors, according to Smith and other researchers.

First, beginning around 2019, religious Americans of all ages stuck with religion at higher rates than expected.

And second, young adults born from 2000 to 2006 have turned out to be about as religious as adults born in the 1990s. Researchers had been expecting a notable religious decline from one birth cohort to the next.

“Today’s youngest adults aren’t really less religious than the second youngest cohort and that limits how much the youngest cohort is tugging down on the nation’s overall religiousness,” Smith said.

Religion experts don’t know for sure what caused these two developments, but some believe the COVID-19 pandemic played a role.

Although COVID-19 forced temporary church closures, it also prompted congregations to boost their outreach efforts and their use of livestreaming technology.

Those shifts, along with the fact that tragedy often draws people closer to God, likely contributed to the religious landscape’s recent stabilization, Green said.

“The spiritual needs of people went up quite dramatically during the pandemic,” he said. “It could very well be that many people found what organized religion could offer them to be particularly rewarding.”

A lasting change?

Pew’s study is focused on the past and present of American religion, but it raises some important questions about the future.

The data suggests that the share of U.S. adults who identify as religious will begin to trend downward again soon, in part because the highly religious cohort of older Americans will shrink as its members die and in part because younger Americans are not expected to grow more religious as they age.

“If the religiousness of today’s young adults stays the same, and future generations look more like today’s young adults than like today’s older adults, then we’d expected to see a resumption of long-term secularization trends,” Smith said.

So what could flip the script?

To keep the trend line stable or even increase the share of Americans who identify as religious, faith groups will need to attract new members.

That’s easier said than done, but religion experts believe the new Pew study points to some potential strategies.

Most notably, the study identified the broad appeal of spiritual beliefs.

Eighty-six percent of U.S. adults believe people have a soul or spirit in addition to a physical body, 83% believe in God or a universal spirit and 79% believe there is something spiritual beyond the natural world, Pew found.

“When asked how their levels of spirituality may have changed over the course of their lifetimes, Americans who say they have become more spiritual outnumber those who say they have become less spiritual by a roughly four-to-one margin (43% vs. 11%),"" researchers wrote.

During Pew’s Feb. 19 press briefing, Penny Edgell, a sociologist at the University of Minnesota who consulted on the report, described these figures as “remarkable” and said that religion scholars and others who care about the future of faith need to pay more attention to spiritual beliefs.

“I was trying to think of anything else that 86% of Americans agree on. That’s remarkably high,” she said.

Similarly, Green said the new data on spirituality presents an opportunity to religious organizations.

“To the extent that religious communities can address spiritual concerns, they may very well draw people back in. If that happens, the pause (in the decline of organized religion) will become a plateau and the plateau may ultimately become growth,” he said.

Another takeaway from the new study is that faith groups will have to make institution-level adjustments to spur growth, since the power of parents is declining.

Although kids raised in religious homes are still much more likely than their peers to become religious adults, the “stickiness” of childhood faith is declining, Smith said.

In other words, religious children today aren’t as likely to become religious adults as they were in the past.

Politics and religion

If Christian congregations don’t find a way to draw in religiously unaffiliated Americans, a couple things will likely happen over the next few decades.

First, as already noted, the trend line for U.S. adults who identify as Christians will start moving downward again.

Second, existing congregations will grow older and more conservative, since politically liberal adults are leaving Christianity at higher rates than politically conservative adults.

“The share of self-described political liberals who identify as Christians has fallen 25 percentage points since 2007, from 62% to 37%. Among self-described conservatives, the Christian share has declined 7 points, from 89% to 82%,” Pew reported.

Already, faith groups are less politically mixed — and less diverse in general — than they were in the past, Green said.

To people who see churches as a place where Americans build bridges across lines of difference, that’s a negative development, he noted. But homogeneity may actually help faith groups attract new members in the coming years.

“From the point of view of congregational stability, homogeneity is good because people don’t engage in arguments very much about things beyond the faith,” Green said.

More progressive congregations, in particular, may benefit from marketing themselves as a place where currently nonreligious — but politically active — liberals can find kindred spirits, Green added.

“One of biggest opportunities for growth would be among people who have more progressive views,” he said.

Other survey takeaways

If you include the appendixes, Pew’s new report is nearly 400 pages long. It includes much more data on religious beliefs and practices than what’s discussed above.

The Deseret News will do deeper dives on the report in the coming months. For now, here’s a quick overview of other key takeaways.

The share of Americans who identify as Protestant has notably declined since 2007, but it’s been relatively stable since 2019 — the same pattern that appears if you look at the data for all Christians. But in recent years, Protestants have been gravitating toward nondenominational churches and away from established denominations, like the United Methodist Church.

Two percent of respondents to the 2023-24 Religious Landscape Study identified as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. That figure is virtually unchanged since 2007, Pew reported.

The share of U.S. adults who identify with a non-Christian religious group has been trending upward over the past two decades. In 2007, 4.7% of Americans identified as Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu or part of some other non-Christian faith group. Now, that figure stands at 7.1%.

Immigrants are driving the growth of non-Christian religious groups in the U.S., but that doesn’t mean there are more non-Christian immigrants than Christian immigrants, according to Smith. Fifty-eight percent of U.S. immigrants are Christian, while 14% identify with other religions.

Historically, American women have been more religiously active than American men. That’s still true today, but the gender gap is small in younger generations. “Among the oldest adults in the new survey (ages 74 and older), the share of women who say they pray every day is 20 points higher than among men. By contrast, among the youngest adults (ages 18 to 24), the share of women who say they pray daily (30%) is similar to the share of men who say they do the same (26%); the 4-point gap is not statistically significant,” Pew reported.

Pew’s methodology

The 2023-24 Religious Landscape Study was conducted from July 17, 2023, to March 4, 2024, in English and Spanish.

Pew used address-based sampling to create its nationally representative sample of 36,908 U.S. adults.

Most participants took the survey online, but they had the option of participating via paper form or phone conversation.

The 2007 and 2014 studies, on the other hand, were administered entirely by phone.

The “mode change” in 2023-24 explains why researchers weren’t always comfortable making direct comparisons between the earlier studies and the new data, according to Alan Cooperman, Pew’s director of religion research.

The margin of error for the full sample in 2023-24 is plus or minus 0.8 percentage points.",Center,True

Gavin Newsom is launching his own podcast — and inviting MAGA favorites,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-26-1018/arts-and-entertainment-gavin-newsom-launching-his-own-podcast-and-inviting-maga,Politico,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/politico-media-bias,Lean Left,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/26/gavin-newsom-podcast-maga-00206153,"Newsom is hardly the first politician to have his own podcast platform. But in an interview with POLITICO Tuesday, he pointed to aspects he believes differentiate it from the typical gabfest: He’s an officeholder booking guests he vehemently disagrees with — occasionally to spar, but with the goal of building out a forum that illuminates their respective positions.

“We already know what our disagreements are with the MAGA movement. I want to understand what the motivations are, the legitimacy of those motivations, and just really understand where people are coming from,” Newsom said. “They are influential — they are. They explain more things in more ways on more days about what’s going on and if we’re not trying to understand their motivations, we will be victims of their motivations.”

Newsom, a student of the right-wing ecosystem who is both fascinated and distressed by its ability to elevate subjects into the mainstream, mentioned his regular appearances on Fox News, Newsmax and other conservative outlets. He debated Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in late 2023, moderated by Fox’s Sean Hannity, who remains in regular touch with Newsom. He ran a series of TV ads in red states over the last two years calling attention to their anti-abortion laws.

But his show, premiering in the coming weeks, won’t be confined to crashing the ascendent right-wing.

“At the same time, I want Democrats to come on and sort of challenge where we are on a lot of these issues,” Newsom said. “And so I’m asking the same questions you’re asking of me: Where the hell is the Democratic Party? What are we doing? Who are we? Where are we going? What’s the path back? I’m having the exact same conversations, and I just thought it’d be a hell of a lot more interesting to do it publicly and to do it as honestly as I can.”

Referring to his podcast host persona as “practitioner, not pundit,” Newsom said he wants to give conversations from the show immediate relevance by taking some from concept to action, including new policy approaches and ways he can try to better connect with Californians.

“I’m here to stress test positions, including my own, in a more transparent manner,” he added. “It’s not a place everyone comes for therapy. I’m not looking to just give the orthodoxy — progressive and liberal talking points. There are so many outstanding people doing that, like our gifted professionals. I add no value in that space. I’m a redundant voice … But what I think I can offer is as a practitioner — not an ideologue, not a pundit: I’m in it as much or more than most elected officials in this country, because I’m in the largest state. I’m in a state that’s deeply on the mind of the administration. I’m in a state that is profoundly critical to the fate and future as it relates to some of the most critical industries like artificial intelligence, and obviously in this remarkable moment as it relates to geopolitical re-calibration.”

Newsom has largely resisted offering a fulsome postmortem after his party’s miserable 2024 election, though he said the notebook he’s jotted ideas in has grown from eight handwritten pages to 28 as more numerical and anecdotal data emerges. His approach on the podcast recalls the Newsom of early 2022, who grew increasingly exasperated about the lack of aggressiveness to confront resurgent Republicans in the national culture wars. Ultimately, he rallied behind the party’s leaders and became a top surrogate for former President Joe Biden.

Newsom said his goal isn’t to circumvent the news media but to take advantage of his position and deep contact list “to engage, promote and explore dialogue.” He counts comedian Bill Maher’s HBO program and podcast as creative inspiration for his new program, contending the host finds common ground with adversaries while taking frequent aim at Democratic dogma.

“I watch him because I appreciate how he calls balls and strikes — takes shots at both parties,” said Newsom, a regular guest of Maher’s “Real Time.” “He has a broader value set that is more aligned with mine, but he doesn’t have a problem in suffering fools on either side of the aisle.”

Sam Griffel, who has worked closely with Newsom as a producer on the iHeart podcasts, said his latest effort has an underlying imperative: make sure it’s digestible and authentic, not inaccessible and canned.

“We as a society are good at sniffing out that type of BS,” he said. “So for me, the more we’re willing to be pushing into areas of discomfort for our guests and hosts the more real it will be.”

Asked if guests — particularly Democrats who see the world similarly to him — will be as candid on the podcast as they are in private texts and calls with him, Newsom conceded, “that ultimately will be determinative if this is interesting or not.”

Newsom declined to name the half-dozen guests he said have privately agreed to come on with him. “I don’t want to lose these folks by letting their names out there,” he said. But he gave a big hint: ”Look at the lineup at CPAC.”

“It’s that crew. These are the guys right now who are enjoying their status, they’re enjoying their moment, and they’re having not just a moment here, but around the world. And we want to explore that,” he said.

The Conservative Political Action Conference’s recent straw poll identified Newsom and Sen. Adam Schiff as the two Democrats who pose the greatest threat to the U.S. and the GOP.

Newsom is no stranger to his own broadcasts. As lieutenant governor, he hosted the weekly “Gavin Newsom Show,” which briefly ran on San Francisco-based Current TV and featured interviews with guests from Hollywood and Silicon Valley including the then lesser-known tech entrepreneur Elon Musk. A literary memoir he wrote was scheduled for release on May 13, but has been delayed until at least the fall.

Newsom starts his new venture at the top of a crowded two years in his final term. He’s facing state budget pressures, a hostile federal government and an immense rebuilding effort after the most expensive disaster in U.S. history.

While he didn’t spend time focusing his remarks about the new podcast on specific challenges he faces in his last months in office, it will broaden his platform to push back on misinformation he encountered during the wildfires that tore through Los Angeles last month.

The governor, a natural political pugilist, has largely been reluctant of late to take shots at Trump as he works to appeal to the president for federal disaster aid. Newsom believes that Democrats like himself can have more of an impact by zeroing in on key actions he finds especially detestable like deep cuts to Medicaid.

“Those become the dominant moments, from my perspective, where we need to align and be more aggressive,” he said. “People are pushing back. Republicans are now starting to wake up. I think we’ve moved from resignation to now more and more resistance. I think that’s very positive. The question then becomes, how do you strategically do that?”

His word of the year to describe the Trump administration, as he put it, is “betrayal.”

“Fire and fury. What does it signify? Something or nothing?” Newsom asked about the early actions from Washington, allowing that the Musk-led government cuts have added to peoples’ anxiety. “If it signifies something, you got to call that out. And that’s the ‘betrayal.’”

But equally on his radar is Democrats not being overly reactive and instead taking matters into their own hands.

“How do we break through? Are we just reacting to noise with more noise? Are we more strategic this time, and are we going to pierce the consciousness, not just of our base, they’re already with us, but those that we need to bring back?” he asked, describing those and the other questions he posed in the interview as central themes of the podcast project.

Despite constant criticism from the right, Newsom said he’s not overly worried about giving certain MAGA personalities a platform, though when asked about the conspiracist Alex Jones, he said some characters were likely a bridge too far.

Instead, if anything, he said Democrats have avoided or outright ignored the right at their own peril, and praised former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg’s “go-everywhere, talk-to-everyone” strategy that calls for calmly confronting opponents on their own turf.

“I think the biggest mistake we’ve made is staying in the warm embrace of our ideological lane. And it didn’t work out for us. We are sitting here on the sidelines right now trying to figure out how to get back in the game,” Newsom said.",Center,False
Hochul launches ‘You’re hired’ initiative to hire workers fired by DOGE,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-26-1005/politics-hochul-launches-you-re-hired-initiative-hire-workers-fired-doge,Washington Examiner,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/washington-examiner,Lean Right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/3329735/hochul-launches-youre-hired-initiative-hire-workers-fired-by-doge/#google_vignette,"Hochul has begun publicly positioning herself as a major Democratic opponent of President Donald Trump, clashing with him last week over his intervention to kill New York City’s controversial congestion pricing plan. She trolled the president again on Tuesday, flipping Trump’s famous catchphrase to attract workers laid off by Elon Musk’s DOGE.

“The federal government might say, ‘You’re fired,’ but here in New York, we say, ‘You’re hired.’ In fact, we love federal workers,” Hochul said in a video statement on X. “Whatever your skills, we value public service. Check out potential jobs at ny.gov/wewantyou. Come join our New York State family.”

New York State Department of Civil Service Commissioner and Civil Service Commission President Timothy R. Hogues elaborated on Hochul’s call, saying the state is seeking the “best and brightest” to take up the “noble calling” of public service.

“Under Governor Hochul’s leadership, we have been working hard to retain and recruit the next generation of employees and servant-leaders. By coming to work for the Empire State, you’ll have the opportunity to help your neighbors, community and state in a variety of ways — serving, protecting, and caring for your fellow New Yorkers and our wonderful resources in solid, stable jobs,” he said in a statement obtained by ABC 7 News.

Hochul isn’t the only one who has sought to tap into the skills of newly laid-off federal workers. Trump ally Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) expressed sympathy for the over 10,000 federal workers laid off by DOGE, urging them to take advantage of the Virginia job market.

“Today, Virginia stands as the top state for business, with tremendous job opportunities across the Commonwealth. ‘Virginia Has Jobs’ is an opportunity for every Virginian — and every business — to capitalize on the thriving economy, with more than 250,000 open jobs waiting to be filled,” Youngkin said.

The governor added that Virginia was there to help and support the recently unemployed workers.

“I want to reiterate that if you are in our federal workforce. We care about you. We want to support you. We want to make sure that if you experience any job interruption or changes, that you know where to go to get support infrastructure to find that next great opportunity with one of these fabulous employers,” Youngkin said.

Youngkin’s offer would be easier for many, as 145,000, 6.3% of all federal workers, reside in Virginia.

Led by Musk, DOGE has aimed to slash government spending by cutting programs and shrinking the federal workforce. The effort has come under fierce criticism from elected Democrats, highlighting individual cases of workers laid off by the department.

Hochul’s trolling of Trump regarding the laid-off federal workers is her latest move in a public campaign against the native New Yorker. The usually reserved governor adopted a stark change in tone on Wednesday in response to the Department of Transportation’s intervention regarding congestion pricing.

“I’m here to say: New York hasn’t labored under a king in over 250 years,” she said to cheers. “We sure as hell are not going to start now.”

Going beyond congestion pricing, Hochul said the problem was secondary and that Trump’s move represented “an attack on our sovereign identity, our independence from Washington.”

“We are not subservient to a king or anyone else out of Washington,” she said. “So this is the fight we’re in. We’re fighting for our residents, our commuters, our riders, our drivers, our emergency personnel.”",Lean Right,True

Share Copy Link ✓ Link copied to clipboard! Millions of Social Security recipients impacted by the Social Security Fairness Act will no longer have to wait up to a year for their benefits to increase, the Social Security Administration (SSA) has announced. Why It Matters Earlier this year, lawmakers passed a bill that would repeal the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO). Both of these reduced Social Security benefits for millions of workers, including teachers, firefighters, and police officers, and some federal employees. Signing the act into law, former President Joe Biden said it would permanently boost Social Security benefits for more than 2.8 million recipients, and that retroactive payments backdated to January 2024 would also be issued. But these groups were told that it could take up to a year for backdated payments and renewed benefits amounts to be administered. What To Know The WEP reduced Social Security benefits for individuals who receive pensions from public-sector jobs—such as those held by state and federal employees—that did not require Social Security payroll tax contributions. This reduction applied even if they contributed to Social Security through other employment and qualified for benefits. The GPO reduced spousal or survivor benefits for retired federal, state, and local government workers who did not pay into Social Security funds through their payroll taxes.

GETTY Now, the SSA has confirmed that impacted groups, consisting of some 3.2 million people, will receive a one-time retroactive payment by the end of March . Higher benefits—which former President Biden said would be an average $360 a month—will be administered from April onward. The SSA has said that, ""depending on factors such as the type of Social Security benefit received and the amount of the person's pension, the change in payment amount will vary from person to person."" The federal agency added that impacted recipients ""will receive a mailed notice from Social Security explaining the benefit change or retroactive payment."" Why Were Payments Delayed? On its website, the SSA said it was ""finalizing its plan to implement the act while limiting negative effects on our regular workloads and services to the public."" However, the implementation of the Act is being hampered by a hiring freeze and ""ongoing staff shortages,"" the SSA said. The administration added that it expected it ""could take more than one year to adjust benefits and pay all retroactive benefits."" What People Are Saying Lee Dudek, acting commissioner of Social Security, said in a press release issued on February 25 : ""Social Security's aggressive schedule to start issuing retroactive payments in February and increase monthly benefit payments beginning in April supports President Trump's priority to implement the Social Security Fairness Act as quickly as possible. ""The agency's original estimate of taking a year or more now will only apply to complex cases that cannot be processed by automation. The American people deserve to get their due benefits as quickly as possible."" John Hatton, staff vice president of policy and programs at National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, told Federal News Network : ""SSA's announcement that they will begin paying benefits to those impacted by WEP and GPO this week is music to our ears. This is much quicker than previously forecast, and will have an immediate, positive impact on those who have waiting decades for this relief."" What Happens Next With payments expected to arriving over the next two months, the SSA has urged beneficiaries to wait until April to ask about the status of their retroactive payment since these payments will be processed incrementally into March. As for increased monthly payments, new amounts will be distributed starting in April's payment, so beneficiaries should wait until after receiving it before contacting Social Security if they have any queries about their monthly benefit amount. fairness meter fairness meter Newsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.

The Romanian government nullified the election results on ""flimsy suspicions of an intelligence agency and enormous pressure from its continental neighbors,” remarked Vance.

The new presidential vote is planned for May 4, with a possible run-off vote scheduled for May 18.

The vice president also took the opportunity to call out European Union ""commissars"" for suppressing free speech, failing to address mass migration, and retreating from ""some of its most fundamental values.” He then implored Europe to step up as President Trump works to find an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine.

Following Vice President Vance’s speech, former Prime Minister and current member of the Chamber of Deputies Victor Ponta spoke to Townhall Media.

Townhall Media: Thank you, sir. Before we get to the vice president's speech in Munich, can you clear up speculation or say something more on the reports that you are ""determined"" to enter the presidential race?

Victor Ponta: Now, I can be very clear. Yes, I will run, and yes, I will be the president of Romania.

Townhall Media: During the vice president’s speech, he questioned the annulment of last year’s Romanian election due to alleged Russian interference, implying that such actions undermine democratic resilience. Given these assertions, how do you perceive Romania’s position within the broader U.S.-Europe relationship? Should Romania align more closely with U.S. perspectives on governance and free speech, or maintain its current trajectory within the European framework?

Victor Ponta: Ever since we threw away the shackles of communism, Romania and its people have committed to a special partnership with the U.S. As prime minister of Romania ten years ago, I had to take strategic decisions that proved this. For example, to buy for the Romanian Airforce F16 jets, to release the first licences for shale gas and offshore gas to Chevron and Exxon. We hold the second-largest American military base on the continent.

But now, with the new administration led by President Trump, the enthusiasm of Romanians about America is even greater. The absolute majority of Romanians are sharing the values promoted by the MAGA movement: God, family, country, peace. Mr. Trump is very popular in my country.

Romania will always be in Europe and a proud member of the EU, but when I’m elected as president, I will advocate for more alignment with the U.S. There is no NATO without the U.S., and there is no reliable military or energetic security for the continent without the U.S. As president of Romania, I would come immediately to the Trump administration with a clear common project to make Mihail Kogalniceanu Air Base (MKAB) in Romania, the largest U.S. base in Europe, and another economic project to develop with American companies in the field of huge natural resources which are already confirmed in the Black sea and the Carpathian areas.

Romanian people are disappointed by the bureaucracy and lack of transparency in Brussels, as we witnessed during the COVID pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Most of all, the shameful decision to cancel the second round of elections in our country without evidence or reasonable cause – and without any pushback from Europe. And so, besides military and economic cooperation, I strongly believe that only the U.S. can guarantee for Romania a clear and sustainable return to free speech and democratic elections. The people of Romania must have a voice and be allowed to vote for whomever they want, and I greatly welcome the new administration’s firm stance on that issue.

Townhall Media: Reflecting some more on last year’s cancelled elections, what measures would you propose to strengthen Romania’s electoral integrity? How can Romania balance the need for security with the preservation of democratic processes and public trust?

Victor Ponta: The first thing we have to do is transfer the power back to the people. We have a ridiculous situation where the banning of candidates or annulling elections is completely in the hands of a few judges without any oversight or participation of parliament. The ultimate sovereign is completely shut out. When I was PM, it was different. But after I left office, it was changed into a non-transparent and undemocratic way. The system in Romania is stronger than the people’s will, and this is the greatest cause of anger and distrust.

The core values of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of elections, where the people are the sovereign, have been lost, taken hostage in the last ten years by a system that serves its own interests – God forbid even foreign interests – and not the Romanian people. Only in very, very extreme cases do security interests need to outweigh democratic ones – and that principle has been lost in Romania.

I saw that system from very close when I was prime minister 10 years ago. I started to fight it by reforming old economic structures and creating a powerful and free economy. People had more money in their pockets and more freedom back then. But the system manipulated my elections for president and even killed people to force me out of office. They continued to chase me, tried to prosecute me and imprison me, and I had to fight for my innocence, just like Mr. Trump.

I made my mistakes but now I come back smarter and stronger. The system cannot threaten me anymore, and I know its weaknesses. I know I have a strong backing from the new U.S. administration, and I’m going to push new reforms to release both the Romanian economy and Romanian democracy because our people deserve to live better. It’s time for the Romanian people to become the first priority and have the system to bow to the sovereign.

Townhall Media: The other weekend, Americans were seeing images on TV of German police arresting people in their homes for social media posts around Europe. Vice President Vance highlighted his concerns about censorship and the suppression of dissent within European countries. What is your stance on these issues within Romania? How would your administration ensure the protection of free speech and political diversity, while safeguarding national security?

Victor Ponta: I can guarantee one thing for sure – when I’m president, no one in Romania will be arrested for social media posts unless there is a clear and present danger that the person is about to commit a serious and violent crime, like in the form of terrorism.

The rules and atmosphere of public discussion have changed and we must adapt. Things that were forbidden to say a few decades ago are mainstream today. I am totally disgusted by a culture of cancel where certain views are not allowed to be expressed. Limiting free speech is not the answer – open debate is. We cannot close ourselves and listen only to the ones who have a similar opinion to ours.

Townhall Media: With President Trump’s return to office, there appears to be a shift in U.S. foreign policy – emphasizing support for conservative values and a reevaluation of traditional alliances. A recent poll of Romanians had 62% believing that President Trump’s election was good for Romanians. How do you envision Romania navigating its relationship with the U.S. under this administration? What opportunities or challenges do you foresee arising from this renewed U.S. leadership?

Victor Ponta: The trends in America resemble those in Romania. In these times of uncertainties, we begin to realize how important tradition and faith are as a sense of stability, comfort, and guidance. Romanians didn’t lose their faith in God during the years of communism, and now more and more people return to the churches and monasteries that were a great part of our tradition and values.

There is a side in Europe that is more traditional. Countries like Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Italy present a different attitude towards the North Atlantic relationship than France or Netherlands. We want closer ties with the U.S, and closer economic ties – built on reciprocity and fairness. Romania needs to contribute more to security because that is the only way to secure peace. Europe, without the U.S., is vulnerable, and we must understand that this is a partnership where everyone must feel satisfied. If America thinks it is treated unfairly in terms of trade, we must solve those issues together.

The problem is that, today, the voice of Romania is absent. We are not a small country in the EU but our leadership behaves as a vassal state with no opinion or contribution. We must have our place at the table and make sure that Romania’s interests are fulfilled. When I was prime minister, Romania was growing fast and was attractive to investments from U.S. companies. Now our economy is headed for stagflation, and no one wants to come. Growth is weak and prices are soaring, because our economy is practically managed by an old, self-serving, corrupt system using economic methods that didn’t even work in the 20th century, let alone in the 21st.

I know how to change this, and the only way is by flipping the system on its head; by cutting down on bloated public administration, cutting down on taxes, using our own resources for energy independence, opening the system for more competition, encouraging consumption, and supporting Romanian small businesses. Just like what is done now by the Trump administration in the U.S.

Townhall Media: You were prime minister of Romania from 2013-2015, and it was thought you were leaving politics at the end of 2020. Then you ran and won a seat in parliament in December. What made you get back into the arena?

Advertisement

Victor Ponta: When I was PM ten years ago, the economy was soaring. We cut taxes and encouraged investments and results soon followed. The money flowed to people’s pockets, and I had even bigger and better plans.

The system didn’t like it. They manipulated the elections, and – I dare to say – even caused peoples’ deaths in order to turn the people against me and stop me. I couldn’t fight the system and the people at the same time. When I resigned, taking responsibility for things not directly under my control, I said I will always be on the side of the people. I thought others might come in my place and have the opportunity to continue the progress. Instead, the politicians who took control only thought about themselves, gave up on Romania’s interests, and brought our country to misery and almost bankruptcy.

The last straw was the cancelling of the elections. I understood that the system also wants to take away the people’s voice and that I can no longer remain on the fence. Otherwise, we will really lose everything. We have reached the point of now or never. It is not only shameful and undemocratic but also dangerous. This is the place where democracy ends and tyranny starts.

I want to give people back their voice and their right to choose. I want to give people a sense of control over the system. There is a way to change the system – America has shown us how. And I want to bring the sense of fairness and prosperity back to our people. I have learned from my mistakes and am coming back even more determined to flip the system on its head. I want to put Romanian people in the first place.

Townhall Media: The Trump administration has been critical of the European Union’s bureaucracy and regulatory overreach. How would a pro-Trump Romanian presidency challenge or reform EU policies to make them more favorable to stronger borders, less centralized governance, and greater national autonomy within the Union?

Victor Ponta: The first thing we have to do is look at ourselves. The system in Romania is bloated and inefficient, and that puts a heavy burden on our growth. One of the goals of my project for Romania 2030 is to have an efficient, professional government with a reduced administration. I would like to cut 20% of the Romanian administration workforce across the board, sparing those with direct contact with citizens, like teachers, doctors, and nurses. Such a measure would weed out inefficiency and waste, and allow us to raise salaries for those remaining – thus attracting better people. Citizens are tired of government offices that only serve themselves and a system that doesn’t care about them.

Townhall Media: It is often said that a man is measured by the enemies he makes – who are the forces that don’t want you running? What do you say to Romanians who might be undecided?

Victor Ponta: The interference in elections didn’t start today but already existed back when I ran for president 11 years ago. The system used all its powers to manipulate the elections in a very unfair way. After I lost, they didn’t stop. They were afraid of me returning to power and orchestrated the legal system against me. I had to face several bogus charges that eventually were dismissed.

I thank God I was able in the last few years to build my independent business – not connected to anything in Romania. I am totally free from the system, and they cannot threaten me anymore. It is not to say they are not trying. I am getting hints and messages that show me that I am still very much feared by very powerful groups in the Romanian state. In the years since I left office, the system only got stronger, more arrogant, and more determined.

Fortunately, today I am more experienced and smarter. I know exactly the weaknesses of the system and how to counter it. I am much more determined than before because I know it is now or never. If the system can get away with cancelling the elections and blocking people’s voices then we are headed for doom. In these elections, I ask voters to consider who has a plan to transfer power from the system to the people, and who already has experience in making Romanians – and not the system – wealthier and more prosperous. We have a resourceful and rich country, and our citizens should be the first ones to benefit and enjoy this. Romanians should feel they are in the first place, not some self-serving system beholden by corruption and foreign interests.

Townhall Media: Thank you. As we wrap up, what would you like to say to the average American citizen who may not typically pay attention to Romanian politics from 5,000-6,000 miles away?

Victor Ponta: I want to say to all Americans that Romania and Europe are your allies in making a world where the values of democracy and freedom of speech are paramount. I want to say that the U.S. and Romania have lots of economic opportunities to discuss, and we are open to American companies and investors. And I want to say that Romania is one of the most, if not the most, beautiful countries in Europe, with ancient traditions and mysteries – like the home of Count Dracula – and I invite and welcome American tourists to come and explore and enjoy.

Eli Lilly plans at least $27 billion in new U.S. manufacturing investments,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-26-0735/economy-and-jobs-eli-lilly-plans-least-27-billion-new-us-manufacturing,CNBC,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnbc,Center,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/26/eli-lilly-to-invest-27-billion-in-new-us-manufacturing.html,"Eli Lilly on Wednesday said it will invest at least $27 billion to build four new manufacturing sites in the U.S., as demand for its blockbuster weight loss and diabetes injections soars and the company develops new drugs for other conditions.

It comes as drugmakers and companies across different industries work to build goodwill with President Donald Trump, who has emphasized reshoring manufacturing to the U.S. and reducing reliance on foreign supply chains. He has threatened companies — and pharmaceutical businesses in particular — with tariffs if they do not manufacture products in the U.S.

Eli Lilly made the announcement at an event in Washington, D.C. — emphasizing the political undertones of the strategy. The event featured several speakers from the Trump administration, including Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who explicitly tied the announcement to Trump's policies.

Lutnick said the investment is ""exactly what the Trump administration is all about, which is building and manufacturing and reshoring in America, investing in America, building in America."" He thanked Eli Lilly for ""doing exactly what the president was hoping would happen.""

Lutnick added that ""if you want to understand the tariff policy"" of the U.S., ""I have just articulated it.""

The move brings Eli Lilly's total U.S. manufacturing investments to more than $50 billion in recent years. The other $23 billion is from the company's investments in new plants and site expansions since 2020, which has helped ease supply shortages of its popular drugs.

""This represents the largest pharmaceutical expansion investment in U.S. history,"" Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said at the event. ""We're making these investments ... to prepare for the demand we anticipate for future pipeline medicines across our therapeutic areas.""

Shares of the company closed more than 1% higher on Wednesday.

Three of the future U.S. sites announced Wednesday will manufacture active ingredients in medications, such as tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly's obesity drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro. Ricks noted that there is a ""real gap in supply chain in the U.S. as it relates to active ingredient availability in our country.""

The fourth site will extend the company's global manufacturing network for future injectable therapies, he added.

Eli Lilly has not decided on where the four new U.S. sites will be located, Ricks said. The company will be accepting location submissions through March 13 and will announce decisions on new sites in the coming months.

Eli Lilly said the four new sites will create more than 3,000 jobs for workers such as engineers and scientists, along with 10,000 construction jobs as the plants are built. The company's other U.S. plants include sites in North Carolina, Indiana and Wisconsin.

The new investments aren't solely dedicated to Eli Lilly's current and future obesity and diabetes treatments. The company is charting its future beyond Zepbound and Mounjaro, with hopes to deliver drugs from its broad pipeline of products for cancer, Alzheimer's disease and other conditions.

Ricks said the company is optimistic about its pipeline across therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic health, oncology, immunology and neuroscience.

Still, the new investments build on the success of Zepbound and Mounjaro, which share dominance of the booming market for so-called GLP-1 drugs with Novo Nordisk 's weight loss drug Wegovy and diabetes treatment Ozempic. Some analysts expect the global obesity drug market to be worth more than $150 billion annually by the early 2030s, making it critical for both companies to maintain their share as other drugmakers scramble to join.

During the event, Ricks took a shot at cheaper compounded versions of its injectable drugs, saying ""America faces a growing threat from an influx of counterfeit and compounded medications.""

Eli Lilly's efforts to boost the supply of Zepbound and Mounjaro aim to ensure that eligible patients are safely accessing those branded treatments instead of cheaper compounded versions. Patients flocked to those unapproved copycats when the branded drugs were in short supply, or if they didn't have insurance coverage for the costly treatments.

The FDA has since declared the shortage of tirzepatide over, which will essentially bar many compounding pharmacies from making copycats.

Hassett said the issue also ""disturbs the White House"" because offshore producers of copycat drugs are ""threatening lives in the U.S.""",Center,True
Farmers Sue Over Deletion of Climate Data From Government Websites,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-26-0733/climate-change-farmers-sue-over-deletion-climate-data-government-websites,New York Times (News),https://www.allsides.com/news-source/new-york-times,Lean Left,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/climate/agriculture-farmer-website-data-lawsuit.html,"Organic farmers and environmental groups sued the Agriculture Department on Monday over its scrubbing of references to climate change from its website.

The department had ordered staff to take down pages focused on climate change on Jan. 30, according to the suit, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Within hours, it said, information started disappearing.

That included websites containing data sets, interactive tools and funding information that farmers and researchers relied on for planning and adaptation projects, according to the lawsuit.

At the same time, the department also froze funding that had been promised to businesses and nonprofits through conservation and climate programs. The purge then “removed critical information about these programs from the public record, denying farmers access to resources they need to advocate for funds they are owed,” it said.

The Agriculture Department referred questions about the lawsuit to the Justice Department, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The suit was filed by lawyers from Earthjustice, based in San Francisco, and the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, on behalf of the Northeast Organic Farming Association of New York, based in Binghamton; the Natural Resources Defense Council, based in New York; and the Environmental Working Group, based in Washington. The latter two groups relied on the department website for their research and advocacy, the lawsuit said.

Peter Lehner, a lawyer for Earthjustice, said the pages being purged were crucial for farmers facing risks linked to climate change, including heat waves, droughts, floods, extreme weather and wildfires. The websites had contained information about how to mitigate dangers and adopt new agricultural techniques and strategies. Long-term weather data and trends are valuable in the agriculture industry for planning, research and business strategy.

“You can purge a website of the words climate change, but that doesn’t mean climate change goes away,” Mr. Lehner said.

The sites under the department’s umbrella include those of the Forest Service, which is responsible for stewardship of forests and grasslands; the Natural Resources Conservation Service, which helps landowners implement conservation practices; and those of other divisions focused on farms and ranches, disaster recovery and rural development.

The directive to delete the pages came by email from Peter Rhee, the department’s director of digital communications, according to the lawsuit.

The plaintiffs allege the actions violated three federal laws and were “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” They asked the court to compel the agency to restore the pages and to block it from deleting any others.

Wes Gillingham, president of the board of Northeast Organic Farming Association of New York, said that farmers were just heading into planning for the summer growing season. He said taking information down because of a “political agenda about climate change” was senseless.

Mr. Gillingham said his organization is the largest organic certifier in New York State, which is a major hub for small farms. They often send farmers to the Agriculture Department website for information on things like conservation programs and which agricultural practices qualify for grants and loans. They also direct people to resources like equipment lending.

“Right now, because of climate change and because of what farmers are facing in terms of extreme weather events, we need every piece of available information we can get,” he said. “We don’t have access to that, we’re not going to make it.”",Left,False
DNI Gabbard Orders Firing of Members of Pornographic LGBTQ Chat Groups in the Intelligence Community,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-26-0731/politics-dni-gabbard-orders-firing-members-pornographic-lgbtq-chat-groups,RedState,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/red-state,Far Right,https://redstate.com/streiff/2025/02/25/dni-gabbard-orders-firing-of-members-of-pornographic-lgbtq-chat-groups-in-the-intelligence-community-n2186020#google_vignette,"Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has given all intelligence agencies until Friday to identify the employees participating in pornographic chats while on duty, revoke their security clearances, and terminate their employment. In a memo released Tuesday evening, Gabbard responded decisively to revelations that numerous employees who were members of a National Security Agency chat system used it to discuss fetishes, kink, and sex as part of the agency's DEI program.

This story broke yesterday (see EXPOSED: NSA, CIA, FBI, and Others Used Government Resources to Do Absolutely Deranged, Disgusting Things – RedState and NSA, CIA Respond to Reports of Concerning Chats in Federal Messaging System – RedState) with the revelation that what seemed to be transgender members of the Intelligence Community representing several intelligence agencies had essentially hijacked two channels on the secure Intelink messaging platform, which helpfully reminds users:

This is a United States Government computer system. This computer system, including all related equipment, networks, and network devices, including Internet access, are provided only for authorized U.S. Government use. U.S. Government computer systems may be monitored for all lawful purposes, including ensuring that their use is authorized, for management of the system, to facilitate protection against unauthorized access, and to verify security procedures, survivability, and operational security. Monitoring includes authorized attacks by authorized U.S. Government entities to test or verify the security of this system. During monitoring, information may be examined, recorded, copied, and used for authorized purposes.

Use of this U.S. Government system, authorized or unauthorized, constitutes consent to monitoring of this system. Unauthorized use may subject you to criminal prosecution. Evidence of unauthorized use collected during monitoring may be used for administrative, criminal or other adverse actions.

The two channels were called LBTQA and IC_Pride_TWG, which were affiliated with LGBTQ+ “employee resource groups” and promoted by agency leadership.

In this case, “diversity” was not a byword for racialism, but rather a euphemism for sex talk. Last January, chatroom members discussed their practice of polyamory, or “ethical non-monogamy.” “[A] polycule is a polyamorous group,” one employee explained. “A is my [girlfriend], and B-G are her partners. . . . then B&C are dating but not C&D, nor E, F, or G with any of the others, though there are several MWB (metas-with-benefits) connections.” Another employee claimed to be part of a nine-member “polycule,” adding that “some of our friends are practically poly-mers, with all the connected compounds.”

At other times, the conversations became explicit. The active source at the NSA claimed to have witnessed hundreds of sexually provocative discussions, which, he added, occurred mostly on taxpayer time. The former NSA source who was familiar with the chats recalled being “disgusted” by a particularly shocking thread discussing weekend “gangbangs.”

The NSA sources also raised the question of some staffers’ mental fitness for the job. In one chat, an NSA employee insists on using “it” pronouns in lieu of the human “he” or “she” pronouns. “[I]t/its user here. While I understand we can make some people uncomfortable, keep in mind that the dehumanizing aspect either a) doesn’t apply or b) is a positive effect when we’re requesting it.” A commenter who disagreed was quickly dismissed by employees of the NSA and CIA, who claimed that refusing to use “it/its” pronouns amounted to “erasing” a transgender identity.

“These are folks with top secret clearances believing they are an IT!” said the NSA source.

White House names Amy Gleason U.S. DOGE Service Administrator,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-25-1715/business-white-house-names-amy-gleason-us-doge-service-administrator,Washington Post,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/washington-post-media-bias,Lean Left,https://washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/25/doge-administrator,"The White House provided an answer to a question Tuesday that had been swirling around Elon Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service for days: Who, officially, is in charge?

A White House official said the DOGE administrator is Amy Gleason, a former health-care executive who worked for the agency in a previous iteration. Now Gleason is positioned, at least on paper, to oversee a massive effort to reshape the federal government that has become synonymous with Musk.

The disclosure comes just days after the director of the White House Office of Administration sparked confusion by declaring in a court filing that Musk, the special government employee whom President Donald Trump said in November would lead the cost-cutting group, has “no actual or formal authority” over government decisions. Moreover, the filing said Musk “is not the U.S. DOGE Service Administrator,” the position outlined in the executive order establishing the U.S. DOGE Service.

Gleason is former chief product officer at Russell Street Ventures, the firm founded by health-care entrepreneur and DOGE adviser Brad Smith, according to her LinkedIn profile. Before that she worked for the U.S. Digital Service, the U.S. DOGE Service’s predecessor agency, during Trump’s first term.

At the USDS “she led the creation of the national covid database and products that used that data to drive the federal response,” an online bio for a speaking opportunity reads.

Friends and former colleagues of Gleason described her as a trained nurse who worked to design electronic medical records, motivated in part by her daughter’s struggle with an autoimmune disease. The Obama administration in 2015 honored those efforts, calling her a “champion of change.” She later joined the U.S. Digital Service during the Trump administration, where she worked on the nation’s coronavirus response. Smith, the health-care entrepreneur who helped oversee the Trump administration’s efforts to fight the pandemic, then hired Gleason in senior roles at his firms. Smith is now helping oversee DOGE’s operations.

“Amy is a world-class talent, inspired by her personal journey with the health system to make it better for everyone,” said Aneesh Chopra, who served as the Obama administration’s chief technology officer and has worked with Gleason on several health-care initiatives, such as an effort called “Blue Button” to make Medicare data available to patients.

“In product terms, she knows how to ‘ship’ digital services and was quickly tapped to manage the seemingly insurmountable challenge of building a real time map of health capacity during the pandemic,” said Chopra in a written message. “Whatever Amy’s role is at DOGE (USDS), leaders like her should instill greater confidence that the work will benefit the American people. I remain in the camp that more effective and efficient government is — and should remain — a bipartisan endeavor.”

Gleason has spoken about her family’s challenges of trying to navigate the complexities of the U.S. health system, arguing that the federal government has the power to cut through bureaucracy and red tape. “One thing that I’ve learned about joining the government is you get to work on really cool problems that affect all of Americans,” Gleason said in a YouTube video posted in 2020, touting her efforts to increase access to Medicare data.

Advertisement

Army disregarded physical fitness standards to hit recruitment goals,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-26-0315/culture-army-disregarded-physical-fitness-standards-hit-recruitment-goals,Washington Examiner,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/washington-examiner,Lean Right,https://washingtonexaminer.com/news/3330468/army-disregarded-physical-fitness-standards-recruitment-goals,"The report, “Management Advisory: Army’s Future Soldier Preparatory Course Places Trainees At Increased Risk of Adverse Health Effects,” found that recruiters and leadership at the Army Training Center and Fort Jackson admitted recruits with body fat percentages that did not comply with the military branch’s physical fitness requirements and standards. According to the report, 14% of the recruits admitted between February and May 2024 who became trainees in the Army’s Future Soldier Preparatory Course program exceeded “the allowable 8% above the body fat composition limit for initial entry, with the highest being 19%.” The report specified that no waivers were granted for these conditions, meaning these recruits should have never been admitted into the program.

Complicating the matter, in addition to violating standards, was the strain admitting such people put on the Army’s medical resources, the report noted. Such practices are hazardous given that the recruits admitted above the acceptable body fat percentage levels could experience health problems. They must lose a significant amount of weight in a short period to meet the body fat percentages to graduate.

“Based on interviews with ATC&FJ officials and the Division Medical Director and a review of ATC&FJ medical policy, we determined that ATC&FJ leadership prioritized the program’s already limited medical resources on the 14% of trainees above the authorized body fat composition limit,” the report read. “With the limited medical support and percentage of trainees above the body fat composition limit, the ARMS (Assessment of Recruit Motivation and Strength) 2.0 pilot program trainees are at an increased risk of suffering adverse medical consequences while trying to lose weight in a short time.”

The possible dangers include the risk of death, the report claimed, due to the need for trainees who were not compliant with body fat requirements “to lose weight quickly to meet the body fat percentage standards.”

According to the policy, any recruit who sought to join the Army was supposed to be, at most, only 8% above body fat requirements to enlist before training to comply with military standards.

SENATE CONFIRMS DANIEL DRISCOLL AS NEXT ARMY SECRETARY

The Army’s Future Soldier Preparatory Course was created to act as a backchannel entrance into the military for those who initially would be disqualified from enlisting due to being unable to meet requirements, such as physical fitness standards, among others, according to Military.com. If a recruit was outside these requirements, the applicant was granted 90 days to comply with Army regulations.

Any recruit who failed to do so would not be admitted into the military branch.",Lean Right,True
"Trump proposes $5 million 'gold card' for wealthy investors, including Russians",https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-26-0531/immigration-trump-proposes-5-million-gold-card-wealthy-investors-including,Euronews,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/euronews-media-bias,Center,https://www.euronews.com/2025/02/26/trump-proposes-5-million-gold-card-for-wealthy-investors-including-russians,"US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he plans to offer a ""gold card"" granting wealthy applicants a path to citizenship at a price of $5 million (€4.76 million), replacing an investor visa that has existed for 35 years.

Describing the people he wanted to see apply, Trump told an Oval Office press conference: ""They'll be wealthy and they'll be successful, and they'll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people, and we think it's going to be extremely successful.""

Asked whether Russian oligarchs would be eligible for the gold card, Trump responded: “Yeah, possibly. I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people.”

According to US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the ""Trump Gold Card"" is intended to replace EB-5 visas in two weeks.

EB-5s were created by Congress in 1990 to generate foreign investment, and are available to people who spend about $1 million on a company that employs at least 10 people in the US.

Lutnick explained that the gold card — which would work similarly to a green card, or permanent legal residency, but granted simply in exchange for money — would raise the price of admission for investors and eliminate supposed fraud and ""nonsense"" that he said characterises the EB-5 programme.

Like other green cards, it would include a path to citizenship.

Lutnick also said that gold card applicants will be vetted ""to make sure they’re wonderful world-class global citizens,"" but offered no details of how that standard would be set.

'Maybe it will be fantastic'

Investors' visas or residence permits are common around the world. Henley & Partners, an advisory firm, says more than 100 countries offer so-called ""golden visas"" to wealthy individuals, including the US, UK, Spain, Greece, Malta, Australia, Canada and Italy.

According to the US Department of Homeland Security's most recent Yearbook of Immigration Statistics, some 8,000 people obtained EB-5 visas in the year ending 30 September 2022.

However, the Congressional Research Service warned in 2021 that the visas pose risks of fraud, including verification that funds were obtained legally.

Annoucing the gold card, Trump made no mention of any requirements for job creation. And whereas the number of EB-5 visas is capped, Trump mused that the federal government could sell 10 million gold cards, supposedly helping to reduce the deficit.

He said the proposed card ""could be great, maybe it will be fantastic"".

""It's somewhat like a green card, but at a higher level of sophistication, it's a road to citizenship for people, and essentially people of wealth or people of great talent, where people of wealth pay for those people of talent to get in, meaning companies will pay for people to get in and to have long, long term status in the country,"" he explained.

While Congress sets legal qualifications for citizenship, Trump claimed the implementation of ""gold cards"" would not be subject to congressional approval.",Center,True
Trump Doesn’t Care About Ukraine or Russia — Just Money,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-26-0530/ukraine-war-trump-doesn-t-care-about-ukraine-or-russia-just-money,The Intercept,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/intercept,Left,https://theintercept.com/2025/02/19/trump-ukraine-russia-war-peace/,"As part of his proposed peace plan in Eastern Europe, President Donald Trump is demanding the full-scale economic colonization of Ukraine.

The terms of Trump’s initial proposal, detailed in a leaked document obtained by The Telegraph, call for U.S. control of Ukraine’s natural resources, ports, and infrastructure, including $500 billion of Ukraine’s mineral wealth as “payback” for the military aid. After years of military aid, Trump has decided now is the time to cash in.

Trump’s proposal asks Ukraine for exclusive rights “in perpetuity” over its natural resources and infrastructure. “This agreement shall be governed by New York law, without regard to conflict of laws principles,” the contract specifies. And revenues would have to be paid to the U.S. before any other party. “That clause means ‘pay us first, and then feed your children,’” a source close to the negotiations told The Telegraph.

Trump’s staggering claim to Ukraine’s mineral wealth is not new. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy himself proposed giving up Ukraine’s natural resources to secure Western aid. And, in Washington, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., previously floated the idea. “They’re sitting on trillion dollars of minerals that could be good for our economy,” Graham said, standing beside Zelenskyy during a visit to Ukraine last year. “So I want to keep helping our friends in Ukraine.”

The $500 billion figure equates to nearly three times the size of Ukraine’s gross domestic product. And, as observers have pointed out, the extent of Ukraine’s mineral wealth may be overstated. Still, it’s undeniable that Trump aims to use the tragedy of the Ukraine war to fatten the coffers of America’s military-industrial complex and capitalist classes.

It’s what he does everywhere. The news of Trump’s initial Ukraine proposal follows closely on the heels of his extreme bid to forcibly expel Palestinians from Gaza to turn it into the “Riviera of the Middle East,” a plot that could potentially be used to enrich the real estate developer’s friends.

As with Palestinians in Gaza, Trump’s vision for enriching his friends in the American ruling class will come at the expense of Ukrainians. And, as in Gaza, Ukraine has no good options, and any deal it accepts with Russia or the U.S. will include painful concessions.

It didn’t have to be this way.

There were several points at which a negotiated end to the conflict could have been reached. In the fall of 2022, when Ukraine had more leverage, a group of congressional progressives urged the Biden administration to pair support for Ukraine’s successes with a “proactive diplomatic push” to seek a ceasefire.

The lawmakers, and the pro-diplomacy camp in general, were relentlessly attacked and smeared for taking the position. Hawks and the so-called pro-Ukrainian side accused anyone who called for a diplomatic path of not caring about Ukrainian lives or sovereignty. They cheered on aggressive military assistance, arguing that even the meekest calls for negotiations were a gift to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The reality is that Ukraine’s war effort was never as stable as its Western supporters claimed.

From the start, American lawmakers repeated the mantra that they would support Ukraine “for as long as it takes.” This was a deeply misleading promise. Wars are expensive, and America’s ability to finance them is determined by economic conditions, domestic politics, and shifting public sentiment. The political will to continue the war indefinitely was never sustainable, yet Ukrainian soldiers were sent into battle under the illusion that the U.S. would remain unwavering in its commitment.

The Biden administration’s Ukraine policy reflects a similar, if less explicit, mindset to Trump’s. Before Putin waged this war, there were offramps. A senior Biden official admitted the U.S. made no effort to negotiate on one of Putin’s top concerns before his invasion — Ukraine’s potential inclusion in NATO. When Kyiv and Moscow engaged in direct talks during the early weeks of the conflict, the U.S. and U.K. governments worked to undermine the negotiations, according to multiple reports.

The Biden administration also pressured Ukraine to lower its draft age from 25 to 18 to increase troop numbers and to deal “more aggressively” with the issue of having tens of thousands of soldiers who do not want to fight. Trump allies like Graham and national security adviser Mike Waltz have also pushed Ukraine to lower its draft age — calls that Zelensky has rejected and are politically unpopular among Ukrainians.

Policymakers in Washington never seriously reckoned with the immense human, economic, and social toll of the Ukraine war because they never had to. For them, it has always been a distant conflict, a tool to weaken Russia while positioning American interests in the region.

Trump’s demand for “payback” from Ukraine — treating the bloodiest conflict in Europe since World War II as if it’s some unappreciated favor — presents U.S. foreign policy in its most naked form.

As a result of the West’s refusal to seriously consider diplomacy, Ukraine is left with impossible choices: fight a losing war without U.S. support, or submit to economic vassalage under the very powers that prolonged its suffering.",Left,True
"European leaders promise greater defense, float Ukraine peacekeeping force in response to Trump",https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-26-0528/ukraine-war-european-leaders-promise-greater-defense-float-ukraine-peacekeeping,Just The News,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/just-news-media-bias,Lean Right,https://justthenews.com/world/europe/european-leaders-promise-greater-defense-float-ukraine-peacekeeping-force-response,"President Donald Trump’s pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and bilateral negotiations with Russia have spurred European leaders to offer promises to take charge of their own security and step up their defense commitments as they seek to keep the new administration engaged on the continent.

Last week, President Trump shocked many European leaders when he appeared to blame Ukraine for provoking the war with Russia and labeled President Zelensky a “dictator” amid tense negotiations over a proposed mineral deal the administration views as a way for Ukraine to pay the United States back for its assistance.

One of President Trump’s chief negotiators, U.S. Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, echoed these sentiments later, telling CNN’s Jake Tapper last weekend that the war was provoked, “and that doesn’t necessarily mean that it was provoked by the Russians” and suggested that talks with Ukraine to one day join the NATO alliance may have been responsible.

“That didn’t need to happen, it basically became a threat to the Russians,” Witkoff.

A larger role

Many European leaders reacted negatively to the Trump administration’s decision to meet with Russian negotiators last week in Saudi Arabia, warning that no lasting peace could be achieved by cutting the Europeans and Ukraine out of negotiations.

Others however tacked a different course. French President Emmanuel Macron, who traveled Washington, D.C. on Monday in an attempt to bridge the gap, is leading a European effort promising to take on a larger security role on the continent to convince the Americans to stay engaged in finding a lasting peace for the Russia-Ukraine war.

Macron visited the American capital on the heels of his own “emergency” European summit on how to end the three-year war in Ukraine. The meeting ended with no firm plans, but it helped forge a common message from European leaders. Macron brought assurances from the United States’ European allies that they are willing to do more to answer President Trump’s concerns, specifically about their own contribution to the continent’s defense.

Macron reassured President Trump that Europe, and specifically France, shares the ultimate goal of peace in the Russia-Ukraine war. He also reiterated his warning that security guarantees for Ukraine are necessary for a “solid” peace, one that would stop conflict from erupting again after any brief pause in fighting.

“I think our common objective…is to build peace and a solid and longstanding peace, and this is what we will discuss, obviously, because I have great respect for bravery and the resistance of Ukrainian people, and we do share the objective of peace, because we are very aware of the necessity to to have guarantees and solid peace in order to stabilize the situation,” Macron said after his meeting with Trump.

Macron also said, on behalf of the European leaders, that Europe is willing to “step up to be a stronger partner, to do more in defense and security for this continent,” which Trump has long demanded since his first term in office.

""indifferent to the fate of Europe""

Germany's Friedrich Merz who is slated to be the next chancellor following the country’s elections on Sunday, said that it might be time for Europe to seek “independence” from the United States on defense.

“After Donald Trump’s statements last week, it is clear that the Americans, at least this part of the Americans, this administration, are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe,” Merz said in an interview, according to Politico. In the past, Merz has proposed a new defense alliance, separate from NATO, as U.S. engagement in Europe declines.

“We must prepare for the worst-case scenario,” he said. “One in which American engagement in European security significantly declines.” But Merz does not necessarily see this as an existential threat to Germany’s alliance with the United States.

In fact, Merz has floated several policies for Germany that may give Trump exactly what he wants: NATO allies that spend more on their own defense and take on a greater role in European security. For example, Merz has proposed a European security alliance separate from NATO that would take on issues vital to the continent’s security, but which are less important for the United States.

Merz made clear that he does not believe that any European efforts should replace the longstanding alliance with the United States, however, stating in an interview that he believes a strong stand by a united Europe could keep the United States engaged.

“Keeping our alliance with the U.S. intact is vital,” Merz said. “NATO is not just a military pact, it’s a political alliance built on shared values: democracy, open societies, and market economies. I sincerely hope we can continue to uphold these principles together.”

Italy

Italy’s leader Giorgia Meloni, a strong ideological ally of President Trump, invoked shared values in a virtual speech delivered directly to Trump’s core supporters gathered at the Conservative Political Action Conference last weekend near Washington, D.C. in which she urged conservatives to continue supporting Ukraine and work to secure a long-lasting peace with the cooperation of Europe.

“You cannot defend your freedom if you lack the means or the courage to do so. Happiness depends on freedom and freedom depends on courage. We proved this when we stopped invasions, won our independences, and overthrew dictators,” Meloni said. “And we have done it together the last three years in Ukraine, where a proud people fight for their freedom against the brutal aggression.”

Meloni said that achieving a “a just and lasting peace” requires it being “built with the contribution of all,” emphasizing that peace cannot be achieved without European cooperation.

Her remarks also appeared to include a veiled warning to her ally, comparing a potential abandonment of Ukraine to President Biden’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, from which his administration never fully recovered.

“And I know that with Donald Trump leading the United States we will never again see the disaster we saw in Afghanistan four years ago,” Meloni said.

Peacekeeping forces

France’s Macron and the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister Kier Starmer reportedly have begun to develop a plan that would see 30,000 European peacekeepers deployed to Ukraine if a ceasefire is signed with Russia, according to the Wall Street Journal.

In his meeting with Macron, Trump said he approved of the idea, likely seeing it as a way to provide security guarantees that Ukraine seeks without using U.S. troops directly. Macron and Starmer, who is set to visit Washington himself on Thursday, both believe that a U.S. “backstop” would be necessary to protect European troops in Ukraine and to deter Russia from violating a potential ceasefire.

Trump gave no indication whether U.S. troops would be involved in the plan, but said he believed the European forces would be enough to secure the peace.

“And a lot of the European countries, I think I don't want to speak for France, but I know that the [French] president's talked about doing that also, I think that'll be a very good day when we can go in as peacekeepers, as opposed to what's going on right now with everybody being killed,” Trump said.

“And I don't think you're going to need much backing. I think that's not going to be a problem. Once an agreement is signed, Russia is going to get back to its business, and Ukraine and Europe are going to get back to their business. I don't think it's going to be a problem,” he said.",Lean Right,True
Billion Indians have no spending money - report,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-26-0527/world-billion-indians-have-no-spending-money-report,BBC News,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias,Center,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rk5d7ekjmo,"Billion Indians have no spending money - report

2 days ago

Nikhil Inamdar, BBC News, Mumbai

India is home to 1.4 billion people but around a billion lack money to spend on any discretionary goods or services, a new report estimates.

The country's consuming class, effectively the potential market for start-ups or business owners, is only about as big as Mexico, 130-140 million people, according to the report from Blume Ventures, a venture capital firm.

Another 300 million are ""emerging"" or ""aspirant"" consumers but they are reluctant spenders who have only just begun to open their purse strings, as click-of-a-button digital payments make it easy to transact.

What is more, the consuming class in Asia's third largest economy is not ""widening"" as much as it is ""deepening"", according to the report. That basically means India's wealthy population is not really growing in numbers, even though those who are already rich are getting even wealthier.

All of this is shaping the country's consumer market in distinct ways, particularly accelerating the trend of ""premiumisation"" where brands drive growth by doubling down on expensive, upgraded products catering to the wealthy, rather than focusing on mass-market offerings.

This is evident in zooming sales of ultra-luxury gated housing and premium phones, even as their lower-end variants struggle. Affordable homes now constitute just 18% of India's overall market compared with 40% five years ago. Branded goods are also capturing a bigger share of the market. And the ""experience economy"" is booming, with expensive tickets for concerts by international artists like Coldplay and Ed Sheeran selling like hot cakes.

Why global stars like Coldplay and Ed Sheeran are hitting India

Companies that have adapted to these shifts have thrived, Sajith Pai, one of the report's authors, told the BBC. ""Those who are too focused at the mass end or have a product mix that doesn't have exposure to the premium end have lost market share.""

The report's findings bolster the long-held view that India's post-pandemic recovery has been K-shaped - where the rich have got richer, while the poor have lost purchasing power.

In fact, this has been a long-term structural trend that began even before the pandemic. India has been getting increasingly more unequal, with the top 10% of Indians now holding 57.7% of national income compared with 34% in 1990. The bottom half have seen their share of national income fall from 22.2% to 15%.

The latest consumption slump, however, has deepened amid not just a destruction in purchasing power, but also a precipitous drop in financial savings and surging indebtedness among the masses.

The country's central bank has also cracked down on easy unsecured lending that propped up demand after the Covid pandemic.

Much of the consumption spending of the ""emerging"" or ""aspirant"" class of Indians was led by such borrowing and ""turning off that tap will definitely have some impact on consumption"", says Pai.

In the short run, two things are expected to help boost spending - a pick-up in rural demand on the back of a record harvest and a $12 billion tax give-away in the recently concluded budget. It will not be ""dramatic"" but could boost India's GDP - largely driven by consumption - by over half a percent, says Pai.

But major longer-term headwinds remain.

India's middle class - which has been a major engine for consumer demand - is being squeezed out, with wages pretty much staying flat, according to data compiled by Marcellus Investment Managers.

""The middle 50% of India's tax-paying population has seen its income stagnate in absolute terms over the past decade. This implies a halving of income in real terms [adjusted for inflation],"" says the report, published in January.

""This financial hammering has decimated the middle class's savings - the RBI [Reserve Bank of India] has repeatedly highlighted that net financial savings of Indian households are approaching a 50-year low. This pounding suggests that products and services associated with middle-class household spending are likely to face a rough time in the years ahead,"" it adds.

The Marcellus report also points out that white-collar urban jobs are becoming harder to come by as artificial intelligence automates clerical, secretarial and other routine work. ""The number of supervisors employed in manufacturing units [as a percentage of all employed] in India has gone down significantly,"" it adds.

The government's recent economic survey has flagged these concerns as well.

It says labour displacement as a result of these technological advancements is of particular concern for a mainly services-driven economy like India, where a significant share of the IT workforce is employed in low value-added services sectors that are most prone to disruption.

""India is also a consumption-based economy, thus the fall in consumption that can result from the displacement of its workforce is bound to have macroeconomic implications. If the worst-case projections materialise, this could have the potential to set the country's economic growth trajectory off course,"" the survey says.

"UK users are losing a key Apple security feature, raising questions about the future of privacy",https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-26-0527/technology-uk-users-are-losing-key-apple-security-feature-raising-questions,CNN Business,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnn-business-media-bias,Lean Left,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/25/tech/apple-advanced-data-protection-uk-encryption,"Apple users in the United Kingdom will no longer have access to a key data security feature for iCloud storage: Advanced Data Protection. It’s a relatively small change, but privacy experts worry it could have ripple effects for data privacy around the world.

The iPhone maker confirmed last week that it would end access for UK users to the optional end-to-end encryption feature, which helps to ensure that only users can access their own personal data, such as photos and messages.

The move was widely viewed as an effort to avoid complying with a request from the British government for a technical “back door” to access user data. Still, the situation could serve as an example that other governments could follow to undermine user privacy, experts say.

“This has always been one of our major concerns,” said Caroline Wilson, general counsel at UK-based nonprofit Privacy International. “The fact that the UK government… is setting a bad precedent for other governments around the world.”

Apple said in a statement that it is “gravely disappointed” to no longer offer the feature to UK users, “given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy.”

But the company had little choice, experts say.

“Apple was in a very difficult spot here,” said John Verdi, senior vice president of policy at Washington, DC-based advocacy group Future of Privacy Forum. “Folks in the United Kingdom simply will not have available the top level of security that Apple provides elsewhere in the world.”

What is Advanced Data Protection?

Apple’s iCloud storage service uses end-to-end encryption to protect 14 categories of sensitive data by default, including health data and passwords, stored in users’ iCloud Keychain.

That means user data is basically scrambled when it’s stored on Apple’s servers, and only the user who holds the account can access it in its un-scrambled form. So, no one with access to Apple’s servers — like hackers, or even the company itself — could read users’ sensitive data.

“In the digital world, end-to-end encryption is going to be your best bet for getting a truly private and secure conversation that’s kind of on the level of what you could have in person,” said Joe Mullin, a senior policy analyst for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

Advanced Data Protection, or ADP, extends end-to-end encryption for additional categories of data, including photos, notes, voice memos and iCloud backups (think text messages and call logs). So, in the event of a data breach, for example, content like this would be inaccessible to a hacker since even Apple can’t read it.

“One of the very few ways to make sure that your data can’t be leaked if a company is breached is to make sure that the company (itself) doesn’t have it,” said Sarah Scheffler, an assistant professor in Carnegie Mellon’s Cylab Security and Privacy Institute.

UK users will now lose protection for those additional categories of data. Those who have not already enabled ADP are no longer able to do so, and Apple says it will soon provide guidance to existing users on how to disable the feature.

There are third-party cloud storage options that offer end-to-end encryption, like NordLocker and Proton Drive. But Mullin notes that consumers are less likely to use them because they’d have to go through extra steps, whereas Apple’s system can back up your phone automatically when it’s locked and connected to power and Wi-Fi.

“You kind of need these encrypted services on some level from the people that are making the (operating system) on your phone,” said Mullin. “That’s why so much of the encryption conversation is around what Google and Apple are doing.”

Advanced Data Protection will still be available outside of the UK. For UK users, those standard end-to-end encrypted data categories will not change, and iMessage and FaceTime will remain end-to-end encrypted.

“It’s a shame,” Verdi said. “It makes British citizens less safe.”

The UK fight over data access

Apple’s move comes weeks after multiple news outlets reported that British security officials had ordered Apple to build a technical back door that would allow access to the company’s global user data. The demand reportedly came under the Investigatory Powers Act, which lets British law enforcement compel access to communications and metadata from tech companies in secret.

Apple has built its brand around privacy and previously resisted building back doors to allow governments or law enforcement access to its users’ information.

“As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will,” the company said in a statement regarding the change to ADP.

But without end-to-end encryption, Apple could have access to users’ data, which means law enforcement could legally compel the company to hand it over to aid in the investigation and prosecution of crimes. That may be why Apple believes the move to end ADP in the region will be enough for the British government.

“The decision to pull this privacy feature in the UK is an attempt to hopefully not undermine it in the rest of the world,” Wilson said.

Apple has declined to comment directly on the British demand. The UK’s Home Office, which is responsible for making requests under the Investigatory Powers Act, did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.

A broader security threat

But even if it makes it easier for law enforcement to access user data, it’s “impossible to provide exceptional access” to data for some parties without “undermining security for everyone,” Verdi said.

“Either everyone is protected by strong encryption, or it’s weakened for everyone,” he said.

He added that law enforcement could instead seek to access data directly from, with a warrant that compels them to unlock their devices.

In the wake of the UK’s move, Verdi says he sees “two possible futures.” In one scenario, other governments could decide they want to do the opposite of the UK and give individuals, companies and government officials the “best security Apple has to offer,” boosting encryption protections. But some governments could also follow the UK’s lead and “seek to undermine security” by passing rules or making demands that force tech companies to weaken their encryption.

“What happens now?” said Scheffler. “This is one piece in a very large puzzle over… the future of privacy, and the future security and the future of encryption.”",Center,False
Johnson and Trump pull off surprising win to advance GOP agenda after vote whiplash in the House,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-26-0447/politics-johnson-and-trump-pull-surprising-win-advance-gop-agenda-after-vote,CNN Digital,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnn-media-bias,Lean Left,https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/25/politics/house-gop-budget-trump-agenda/index.html,"Speaker Mike Johnson pulled off a stunning turnaround Tuesday night to rescue a critical vote to advance President Donald Trump’s agenda that had seemed doomed just moments earlier.

Surprising even some of his critics, Johnson and his leadership team capped hours of drama in the Capitol by successfully flipping multiple Republican holdouts to pass a budget blueprint that will mark the first step toward moving Trump’s ambitious agenda forward. With help from last-minute phone calls from Trump, GOP leaders spent all of Tuesday in a furious pressure campaign to win backing for their plan.

“The world didn’t end today. But I do see the edge,” Rep. Pat Fallon, a Texas Republican, said of the whiplash in the House.

Republicans had punted the vote Tuesday night only to turn around minutes later to call fleeing members back to the floor to muscle through the plan.

In the end, Johnson lost just a single vote — fiscal hawk Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky — which was all he could afford. The Democrats’ whip team scrambled to get near-full attendance on their side: Rep. Brittany Pettersen flew with her 4-week-old baby to make it in time for the vote and Rep. Kevin Mullin, who is recovering from complications from knee surgery, flew with an IV from California.

But the drama won’t end there: Johnson and his allies acknowledge that what comes next will be much more difficult. Tuesday night’s vote itself was procedural and GOP leaders from the House and Senate will need to agree on how exactly to move ahead with Trump’s sprawling legislative package now that they have adopted divergent plans. The days-long saga over the House budget blueprint laid bare bitter divisions among Republicans that will make it extraordinarily difficult to pass that package in both chambers.

Still, the win comes at a critical time for Trump and Johnson as their party faces crushing deadlines ahead, including avoiding a government shutdown next month and the threat of an economic default later this spring. As with Tuesday night’s vote, navigating those political landmines will require near total unity from the GOP.

GOP leaders will now get to work on exactly what will make it into Trump’s first legislative package. The newly passed House GOP plan calls for sweeping tax cuts, steep spending cuts and a two-year debt limit hike, as well as new money for border security and energy production. The Senate’s plan, however, contains only national security and energy money, while punting on the more contentious items for later.

The stakes are high for GOP leaders: Trump is eager to pass his agenda as quickly as possible, even as party leaders must comply with the extremely strict constraints of the budget powers that allow their party to pass a package without Democratic votes. And Republicans will need to tread carefully on reforms to popular programs like Medicaid, food assistance and Pell grants — concerns that nearly sunk the budget plan this week.

The successful vote capped a dramatic 12 hours for Johnson. In the morning, he held a tense meeting with House Republicans to convince his members to back the budget blueprint or risk forgoing key parts of Trump’s agenda.

But by the afternoon, House GOP leaders were still struggling to lock down the votes, and even the relentlessly upbeat Johnson acknowledged he may need to pull it.

The votes weren’t there around 7:30 p.m., when the speaker moved to scrap plans to hold the vote at all. But then his leadership team — with help from a Trump call to Rep. Victoria Spartz — was able to win over the last holdouts. So, just moments after dismissing members, Johnson called them back to vote and passed the GOP’s budget blueprint.

Rep. Warren Davidson, an Ohio Republican, said he decided to change his vote after he received “assurances” of a future plan that could survive the Senate to trim discretionary spending, though he offered no specifics.

And Spartz added that she spoke with Trump on health care issues, saying, “He’s on board to get some great things done on health care. … I trust his word.”

“I think the last few weeks are showing us how difficult it is to move any package through the House,” Rep. Dusty Johnson, a leadership ally, acknowledged earlier Tuesday. “This is a motley crew.”

Hours before the scheduled vote, hardline conservatives insisted there weren’t enough spending cuts in the plan, even as centrist-leaning Republicans remained uneasy about the size of those cuts and whether they could impact popular programs like Medicaid. And Johnson’s efforts to win support even backfired in some corners. Massie said he left a meeting Tuesday morning even more dug in against the budget than before.

“They convinced me in there, I’m a no,” the Kentucky Republican said, holding up a thick packet of leadership talking points and railing against their plans line by line. By the time of the vote, Massie remained the only GOP “no.”

Johnson and his whip team had spent the last several days trying to win over their more moderate members, many of whom had raised concerns that the budget plan could ultimately lead to cuts to the low-income health program Medicaid.

Ahead of the vote, Republicans from northeastern states were particularly wary of plans to cut $880 billion over a decade from federal health and energy programs, which they fear cannot be achieved without cutting Medicaid, the hugely expensive health program, since Trump has vowed not to touch Medicare.

GOP leaders have strongly pushed back against the idea that benefits would be cut, noting that the budget plan is only a framework and not specific policy. They argue there are ways to cut hundreds of billions in wasted money on federal health programs without slashing Medicaid benefits, though it remains unclear where those cuts would come from.

“This is a procedural vote. You tell me what the cuts are,” House Majority Whip Tom Emmer told CNN when asked about swing seat lawmakers’ concerns about Medicaid cuts.

In the end, Johnson only recorded a single Republican defection.

“We will get there, as we always do,” the speaker predicted earlier in the day, when he was still lacking at least a half-dozen votes.

The vote on passage was 217-215 with Representative Thomas Massie, a prominent fiscal hawk, as a lone Republican voting in opposition, and no Democrats supporting the controversial measure. One Democrat did not vote. The measure is a preliminary step to extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts later this year. Tuesday's vote sent the budget resolution to the Senate, where Republicans are expected to take it up. ""We have a lot of hard work ahead of us, but we are going to deliver the American First agenda,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters after the vote. ""We're going to celebrate tonight, and we'll roll up our sleeves and get right back in the morning."" The final vote came after Johnson and No. 2 House Republican Steve Scalise spent hours persuading holdouts to back the move. The measure's passage followed an unusual series of maneuvers in which Johnson canceled a vote on the bill, because it lacked the votes for passage, and then promptly reversed course. Both leaders said Trump himself had been contacting reluctant members about the need to advance the $4.5 trillion tax-cut plan, which would also fund the deportation of migrants living in the U.S. illegally, tighten border security, energy deregulation and military spending.

REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz/File Photo , Several hardline conservatives sought deeper spending cuts and stronger control over separate government funding legislation to avert a potential shutdown after current funding expires on March 14. Three Republican hardliners seen initially as firm no votes - Tim Burchett, Victoria Spartz and Warren Davidson - wound up voting for the measure in the end. Doubts about House Republican unity prompted Senate Republicans to enact their own budget resolution as a Plan B ploy last week: a $340 billion measure that covers Trump's border, defense and energy priorities but leaves the thornier issue of tax policy for later in the year. Both chambers need to pass the same budget resolution to unlock a parliamentary tool that Republicans will need later this year to circumvent Democratic opposition and the Senate filibuster and enact legislation containing the Trump agenda. The House budget seeks $2 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years to pay for Trump's agenda. The tax cuts Trump is seeking would extend breaks passed during his first term in office, his main legislative accomplishment, that are due to expire at the end of this year. Passing a budget resolution is just the first deadline facing lawmakers in the coming months. Lawmakers also need to enact fiscal 2025 spending legislation to keep federal agencies operating after current funding expires on March 14. Later this year they will need to act on the federal government's self-imposed debt ceiling or risk triggering catastrophic default on its $36 trillion in debt.

Supreme Court hears reverse discrimination case with implications for DEI,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-26-0440/supreme-court-supreme-court-hears-reverse-discrimination-case-implications-dei,Washington Examiner,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/washington-examiner,Lean Right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/supreme-court/3330144/supreme-court-discrimination-case-implications-dei/,"The eventual ruling in the case, Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services, could determine whether so-called reverse discrimination claims should be evaluated under the same standards as those brought by historically marginalized groups.

What is the legal issue before the Supreme Court?

At the heart of the case is the “background circumstances” rule, a legal test used by some federal courts when majority-group plaintiffs, such as white or straight employees, bring discrimination claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This rule requires these plaintiffs to prove that their employer is “that unusual employer who discriminates against the majority.”

Marlean Ames, a former Ohio Department of Youth Services employee and plaintiff in the case, argues that the rule makes it significantly harder for white and straight workers to bring discrimination lawsuits. Ames claims she was passed over for a promotion and later demoted in favor of less-qualified gay employees, a complaint that was rejected by two lower courts beneath the highest.

Ames sued in the Southern District of Ohio, but her case was dismissed for failing to meet the background circumstances rule. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal, acknowledging her discrimination claim was plausible since she was demoted and replaced by gay employees but ruling that she failed to meet the extra burden required for majority-group plaintiffs.

However, several other circuit courts have chosen not to apply the background circumstances rule in discrimination cases, creating a split beckoning the nine justices to bring clarity to the issue. The Supreme Court is now set to resolve a circuit split on whether the background circumstances rule should remain in place during an oral argument hearing at 10 a.m. local time.

How does this case relate to the Supreme Court’s recent rulings on discrimination?

The case marks another major fight over discrimination since the Supreme Court’s landmark 2023 ruling in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard/UNC, which struck down race-based affirmative action in college admissions as a violation of the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause.

That decision held that eliminating discrimination means eliminating it entirely, a principle Ames and her supporters argue should apply equally to employment law.

The Equal Protection Project, led by Legal Insurrection founder William Jacobson, argues in an amicus brief that “reverse discrimination is no longer unusual; it is unfortunately alive and well.”

The brief states that discrimination against white and straight employees has become “ubiquitous,” particularly under corporate DEI initiatives, and that they should not be subject to a higher legal burden.

What are the arguments supporting Ames?

Ames and her supporters argue that the background circumstances rule unfairly places a higher burden on majority-group plaintiffs, making it harder for them to challenge workplace discrimination.

America First Legal, which has filed numerous lawsuits against DEI policies, argues that “nothing in Title VII supports a higher burden for ‘majority’ employees who claim discrimination.”

What are the arguments against Ames?

The Ohio Department of Youth Services defends the background circumstances test as a necessary tool for evaluating discrimination claims fairly. The department warns that eliminating this requirement could open the floodgates to lawsuits challenging diversity policies and complicate efforts to enforce employment laws.

In December, former Biden administration Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar led an amicus brief in support of the department, arguing, “The district court did not apply the ‘background circumstances’ requirement to Ames’s claim that she was demoted because she is a woman.”

A coalition of civil rights organizations, including the NAACP, argues that courts must consider the history of systemic inequality in employment discrimination cases. “Majority-group plaintiffs cannot rely on the same legacy of discrimination to support their claims,” their amicus brief states. The NAACP contends that eliminating the background circumstances rule could make it harder to address long-standing disparities in hiring and promotion.

What stands to change if Ames wins?

A ruling in favor of Ames could make it significantly easier for nonminority employees to bring viable discrimination complaints against employers, depending on the circumstances of their claims.

APPLE SHAREHOLDERS REJECT OVERHAULING DEI PROGRAM’S ‘ILLEGAL DISCRIMINATION’

In turn, a favorable ruling for Ames could reshape workplace diversity initiatives and make DEI policies more legally vulnerable, as conservative groups saw as a logical next step with the undoing of affirmative action for college admissions two years ago.

With the Supreme Court’s Republican-appointed majority having already dismantled affirmative action in college admissions, Ames v. Ohio could become another defining decision in the legal battles over race, gender, and workplace discrimination.",Lean Right,True
This Theory Is Behind Trump’s Power Grab,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-26-0436/donald-trump-theory-behind-trump-s-power-grab,New York Times (Opinion),https://www.allsides.com/news-source/new-york-times-opinion-media-bias,Left,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/opinion/trump-roberts-unitary-executive-theory.html,"In his opening weeks back in office, President Trump is asserting power in a way that pushes hard on, and sometimes past, the boundaries of executive authority.

One of the most important of those boundaries involves his relationship with independent regulatory agencies. Mr. Trump is the first president since the 1930s to assert control over many of them, and this assertion of power will almost certainly be tested in the Supreme Court.

Mr. Trump is operating under the theory that the executive branch is unitary, in the sense that Article II of the Constitution places executive power in a single person, the president, who gets to control every high-level official who executes federal law (and plenty of lower-level ones, too).

If Mr. Trump succeeds in court, the country will see a significant shift in power from the independent agencies to the White House.

For better or for worse, that shift would be profoundly unsettling. And in some respects it could be dangerous — if, for example, a president is allowed to control monetary policy, or if he is in charge of the Federal Communications Commission, and thus able to play politics with national communications policy.

The president is not a king. In its most extreme version, the unitary executive theory is a form of invented history, a modern creation that threatens to change, and in important ways to undermine, the operations of the national government.

The theory of the unitary executive means that the president can fire, at his pleasure, the heads of the Federal Trade Commission, the National Labor Relations Board and other independent agencies. In its strongest form, the unitary executive theory means that the president can control the policy choices of those agencies. So if the F.T.C. wants to issue a rule to protect consumers, and the president thinks that’s a terrible idea, then he can prevent that rule from seeing the light of day.

The unitary executive theory is supported by some distinguished scholars, who point to the Constitution’s text. The first sentence of Article II states that “the executive power shall be vested in a president of the United States of America.” The same article gives the president, and no one else, the power to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.”

Everyone agrees that at the Constitutional Convention, the founders decided to have just one president, rather than a “plural” executive. Practically everyone also agrees that the very first Congress, in creating the departments of Treasury, War and Foreign Affairs, made a momentous decision, widely known as the Decision of 1789: Their heads would be at-will employees of the president. The Decision of 1789 is often thought to show acceptance of the unitary executive theory.

The current conflict over the president’s authority owes its origins to the New Deal period. In a 1935 case, Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, the court ruled that Congress could limit the president’s power to remove a head of the F.T.C. — and thus that it could create independent agencies.

Until recently, many people agreed that under Humphrey’s Executor, independent agencies are just fine under the law, and that the president does not have much authority over them. In the early 1980s, I worked in the Justice Department under President Ronald Reagan, whose White House liked the idea of a unitary executive and who wanted to know if he could exert at least some control over the independent agencies.

Lawyers in the Justice Department decided that Humphrey’s Executor was settled law — but that it left the president some running room. If he wanted, we said, he could direct independent agencies to submit their regulations to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, the president’s regulatory clearinghouse, for a degree of scrutiny and review. We did not think that the president could tell the independent agencies what rules to issue, but we did think that he could require them to subject their rules to a process of comment and analysis by the regulatory office.

Reagan decided not to impose that requirement, partly because of the seriousness of the legal question, and partly because of fear of a fierce congressional pushback.

In the past four decades, both Republican and Democratic presidents have followed Reagan’s lead. To be sure, they have overseen internal discussions about whether to assert the unitariness of the executive and to require independent agencies to submit their rules to the O.I.R.A.

I was administrator of O.I.R.A. from 2009 to 2012, and the issue came up. The White House’s ultimate judgment was that presidential control would not be a good idea. Some government lawyers thought it would raise serious legal doubts. Other White House officials thought that, for one thing, independent agencies avoided an excessive concentration of power in one person. For another, such agencies reduced the risk of self-dealing (as might occur if, for example, a president rewarded his friends and punished his enemies).

More recently, the Supreme Court has shown a distinct discomfort with the whole idea of independent agencies. In Seila Law v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, decided in 2020, the court struck down a provision making the bureau independent on the ground that it was headed by a single person. The court purported to preserve Humphrey’s Executor and the multimember independent agencies (like the F.C.C., the N.L.R.B. and the Fed). But at the same time, the court spoke enthusiastically about the unitary executive, and it is reasonable to doubt whether Humphrey’s Executor will ultimately survive.

President Trump does not like the idea of independent agencies. He recently fired a member of the N.L.R.B., even though board members can be discharged, under the law, only for “neglect of duty or malfeasance in office, but for no other cause.”

His acting solicitor general has said that the Justice Department intends to contest the for-cause protections given to the F.T.C., the N.L.R.B. and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. (Why she singled out those three agencies is not entirely clear.)

The acting solicitor general also said that in certain contexts, the department will contest the idea of independent administrative law judges — adjudicators within the executive branch who do not serve at the president’s pleasure.

And the president has directed the independent agencies to submit their rules for O.I.R.A. review, reversing the course set by Reagan and presidential administrations since.

Mr. Trump may ultimately win in court, but the best historical research throws the whole idea of a unitary executive into serious doubt. In the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton, who rejected a plural executive, also insisted that the president lacks unlimited removal power.

And defenders of the unitary executive appear to have misunderstood the Decision of 1789. The most careful evidence suggests that, at the time, a majority of members of Congress did not embrace but actually rejected the view that Congress lacks power to protect subordinate officials in the executive branch from presidential control. Indeed, independent agencies are hardly a creation of the New Deal — they have been with us since the founding era.

It follows that if you are an originalist, you will probably reject Mr. Trump’s broadest claims.

Then there’s stare decisis, or precedent. The Trump administration’s claims would upset law that has been settled for 90 years. It’s true that the current court has not always respected stare decisis, but it has yet to undertake the kind of radical revision of national institutions that would come from invalidating independent agencies.

Requiring some independent agencies to submit their rules to O.I.R.A. would hardly be the end of the world. It could even do some good. O.I.R.A.’s staffers do a thorough, careful job, and agency regulations are usually improved by the process of review. It would not be unreasonable for the Supreme Court to allow the White House and the regulatory office to comment on, and have some degree of control over, the regulations of most of the independent agencies.

But the case of the Fed puts a bright spotlight on the potential danger of giving the president unlimited authority over independent agencies. There are strong reasons for its independence. If a president could control interest rates, or oversee regulations that are connected to monetary policy, he could manage the economy so as to promote his own short-term political interests.

Or take the F.C.C. A president who oversees its decisions could punish news sources that he didn’t like and reward those he loved.

Or consider the claim that the president gets to impound congressionally appropriated funds and choose which ones to spend. That claim would render Congress subordinate to the executive in what might be its most fundamental power: the purse. Impoundment authority, on the part of the president, would go well beyond the idea of a unitary executive. It would be a devastating blow to the separation of powers.

There are decent arguments in favor of reforms that would increase presidential control over the administrative state. But the broadest current claims about executive authority are a creation of the 21st century, not the 18th. They are a form of hubris. They strike at the heart of our founding document.",Left,True
Trump floats $5 million ‘gold card’ as a route to U.S. citizenship,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-26-0434/politics-trump-floats-5-million-gold-card-route-us-citizenship,CNBC,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnbc,Center,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/25/trump-floats-5-million-gold-card-as-a-route-to-us-citizenship.html,"U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday floated the idea of replacing a visa program for foreign investors with a so-called ""gold card"" that could be bought for $5 million as a route to American citizenship.

Trump told reporters he will replace the ""EB-5"" immigrant investor visa program, which allows foreign investors of large sums of money that create or preserve U.S. jobs to become permanent residents, with a so-called ""gold card.""

The EB-5 program grants ""green cards"" to foreigners promising to invest in U.S. businesses.

""We are going to be selling a gold card,"" Trump said. ""We are going to be putting a price on that card of about $5 million,"" he added.

""It's going to give you green card privileges plus its going to be a route to (American) citizenship, and wealthy people would be coming into our country by buying this card,"" Trump said, adding that details about the scheme will come out in two weeks.

Trump added it is possible Russian oligarchs could qualify for the gold cards, when asked by a journalist if those people would be eligible. ""Yeah, possibly. Hey. I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people,"" he said.

The EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program, administered by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, was created by Congress in 1990 to ""stimulate the U.S. economy through job creation and capital investment by foreign investors,"" according to the USCIS website.

""The EB-5 program ... it was full of nonsense, make believe and fraud, and it was a way to get a green card that was low price. So the president said, rather than having this sort of ridiculous EB-5 program, we're going to end the EB-5 program. We're going to replace it with the Trump gold card,"" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters on Tuesday.",Center,True
FBI looking into Comey’s off-the-books ‘honeypot’ operation targeting 2016 Trump campaign,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-26-0431/politics-fbi-looking-comey-s-books-honeypot-operation-targeting-2016-trump,Washington Times,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/washington-times-bias,Lean Right,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/feb/25/fbi-looking-james-comeys-books-honeypot-operation-targeting-2016/,"FBI leadership is starting an investigation into the origins of the agency’s plan a decade ago to infiltrate the campaign of presidential candidate Donald Trump using two female undercover “honeypot” agents.

The off-the-books investigation, launched in 2015 by FBI Director James B. Comey, was revealed by an agency whistleblower in a protected disclosure to the House Judiciary Committee last year and first reported exclusively by The Washington Times in October.

In the intelligence community, a honeypot commonly refers to an undercover operative, usually a woman, who feigns sexual or romantic interest to obtain information from a target.

The whistleblower said two female FBI undercover employees infiltrated Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign at high levels and were directed to act as “honeypots” while traveling with Mr. Trump and his campaign staff.

The Times has learned that the bureau, now led by Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino, is looking for those once-undercover employees under Mr. Comey’s direction.

The FBI declined to comment.

According to the whistleblower disclosure, which The Times reviewed, the investigation differed from Crossfire Hurricane, a later FBI counterintelligence operation that looked into never-proved allegations that the campaign was colluding with Russia.

The whistleblower said the early off-the-books criminal investigation targeted Mr. Trump and his staff.

Mr. Trump launched his presidential campaign on June 16, 2015, about a year before the FBI opened Crossfire Hurricane.

The whistleblower agent “personally knew” that Mr. Comey ordered an FBI investigation into Mr. Trump and that Mr. Comey “personally directed it,” according to the disclosure.

The investigation did not appear to target a specific crime but was more of what agents would describe as a fishing expedition to find anything incriminating against Mr. Trump.

The whistleblower said the undercover operation was obscured from Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz, who investigated misconduct in the bureau’s probe of the Trump campaign.

“The case had no predicated foundation, so Comey personally directed the investigation without creating an official case file in Sentinel or any other FBI system,” according to the whistleblower’s disclosure. “The FBI has multiple methods of protecting highly sensitive investigations, so Comey did not have a legitimate reason not to officially create an official investigation file or have a file number.”

The disclosure says the secret investigation may have indicated institutional bias at the FBI against Mr. Trump, though “it does not appear that any information about this investigation was turned over to Trump’s criminal defense counsels.”

The investigation was eventually closed because a major newspaper obtained a photograph of one of the undercovers and was about to publish it, but the FBI press office told the outlet that the photograph was an FBI informant who would be killed if the photograph was publicly released.

In fact, it was a photograph of the FBI undercover employee.

The FBI whistleblower employee noted in the disclosure that one of the undercovers agreed to be transferred to the CIA so she would not be available as a potential witness.

The other undercover employee was rewarded for her activities through a promotion in the bureau and is now a high-level FBI executive in a major field office.

The whistleblower employee observed one or more employees in the FBI being directed to never discuss the operation with anyone ever again, including other people involved in the 2016 Trump campaign infiltration operation.",Right,False
Apple’s Dictation System Transcribes the Word ‘Racist’ as ‘Trump’,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-26-0431/technology-apple-s-dictation-system-transcribes-word-racist-trump,New York Times (News),https://www.allsides.com/news-source/new-york-times,Lean Left,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/technology/iphone-dictation-trump-racist.html,"While using Apple’s automatic dictation feature to send messages on Tuesday, some iPhone users reported seeing a peculiar bug: the word “racist” temporarily appearing as “Trump,” before quickly correcting itself.

The message blip, which was replicated several times by The New York Times, provoked controversy after appearing in a viral TikTok post, raising questions about Apple’s artificial intelligence capabilities.

An Apple spokeswoman blamed the issue on phonetic overlap between the two words, and said the company was working on a fix.

The issue appeared to begin after an update to Apple’s servers, said John Burkey, the founder of Wonderrush.ai, an artificial intelligence start-up, and a former member of Apple’s Siri team who is still in regular contact with the team.

But he said that it was unlikely that the data that Apple has collected for its artificial intelligence offerings was causing the problem, and the word correcting itself was likely an indication that the issue was not just technical. Instead, he said, there was probably software code somewhere on Apple’s systems that caused iPhones to write the word “Trump” when someone said “racist.”

“This smells like a serious prank,” Mr. Burkey said. “The only question is: Did someone slip this into the data or slip into the code?”

The issue was the latest stumble at Apple since the company introduced a new A.I. system last year called Apple Intelligence. Last month, the company said it would disable one of the system’s signature capabilities: aggregating and summarizing news notifications. It did so after the system inaccurately summarized news headlines from several media outlets.

In 2018, Siri was the center of another political controversy when the voice assistant displayed a nude image in response to the question: “Who is Donald Trump?” The bug was linked to rogue Wikipedia editors who had changed the source of Siri’s information.

The latest issue started appearing on phones a day after Apple said that it would invest $500 billion in the United States over the next four years. The company said it would begin manufacturing A.I. servers at a new 250,000-square-foot facility in Houston next year.",Center,False
"House approves ‘big, beautiful bill’ budget after wild whip effort",https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-26-0428/politics-house-approves-big-beautiful-bill-budget-after-wild-whip-effort,Politico,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/politico-media-bias,Lean Left,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/25/house-budget-republican-agenda-00206125,"“We’re going to celebrate tonight,” Johnson told reporters after the vote, adding that House Republicans will “roll up their sleeves” as they prepared to reconcile their plans with the Senate.

Tuesday night’s vote came after a wild scene on the House floor that played out over the course of hours. Around 6:30 p.m. members were called to the floor to begin voting on an unrelated measure, with the budget plan to follow. But that unrelated vote was held open for more than an hour as the GOP whip team worked to win over the holdouts.

Democrats screamed “regular order” as the planned 15-minute vote stretched on and on. Shortly after 7:30 p.m., the vote was closed and members were informed the budget vote was canceled. Minutes later, leaders sent out another alert saying the vote was back on.

The holdouts included Reps. Tim Burchett of Tennessee, Warren Davidson of Ohio, and Victoria Spartz of Indiana, as well as Massie. All four voiced public opposition to the budget plan Tuesday and could be seen on the House floor during the evening vote series speaking to various Republican leaders.

The fiscal hawks all raised objections about inadequate spending cuts in the measure; Davidson also aired concerns about how Republican leaders plan to handle the impending March 14 government funding deadline.

Trump spoke over the phone at various points with several of the holdouts, according to two Republicans familiar with the whip effort — Johnson later said the calls were “a big help.” Because of the House GOP’s tiny majority and the united opposition of Democrats, those four members could together block action.

But Johnson and Trump managed to win them over, one by one.

Spartz said in a online post that she came around because Trump had a “personal commitment to save healthcare and make it better for physical and fiscal health for all Americans. ... I trust his word.”

Davidson said in his own post that he “finally received the assurances I needed that there will be cuts to discretionary spending” ahead of the March funding deadline “and that we will work together to develop a plan for further discretionary spending cuts that could survive passage in the Senate.”

And Burchett told reporters that Trump “committed to me that he is going to go after the spending in a lot of these big departments” and that more generally Republicans are “going in the right direction.”

“It’s not everything I wanted, but in this game, you’re either at the table or on the menu,” he said. “It’s time to get at the table.”

Only Massie remained unconvinced.

Meanwhile, a different faction of the GOP conference — moderate Republicans, many representing swing districts — had aired qualms about the scale of the Medicaid cuts implied by the budget plan.

That group, however, quickly softened: On Monday night, some said that a presentation from House leaders had moved them closer to supporting the budget plan, and by midday Tuesday, House leaders were confident enough to move toward a final vote.

After it was all over, top Democratic leaders said Republicans had betrayed Americans by advancing a plan that they said would cut taxes for the richest while cutting benefits for the poor and middle class.

“They chose their billionaire puppet masters over the American people,” said Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. “Democrats were unified, and we will remain unified throughout this process, because this reckless Republican budget will bring nothing but destruction to the American people.”

Several Democrats who have faced health challenges and missed recent House votes rushed back to Washington for the budget showdown. That forced Johnson to scrounge up every vote he could.

Tuesday’s vote sets up a harsh reality check between House and Senate Republicans, who all want to push the president’s agenda forward but still have profoundly different approaches to key issues.

The Senate, for instance, is looking to avoid the deep cuts to Medicaid that the House is leaning on for significant cost cutting. Senate Republicans are also insisting that they won’t support a final measure that only extends Trump’s 2017 tax cuts temporarily. That could require making significant changes to the House blueprint, putting the fragile GOP support for the measure in jeopardy.

GOP lawmakers sound alarm over Trump’s Ukraine strategy,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-26-0426/politics-gop-lawmakers-sound-alarm-over-trump-s-ukraine-strategy,The Hill,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/hill-media-bias,Center,https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5164032-republicans-blast-trump-russia-ukraine/,"Republican lawmakers are sounding the alarm over the Trump administration’s pointed refusal to blame Russia for starting the war in Ukraine, and they are highly skeptical about negotiating any lasting peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom some describe as a war criminal.

The Republican criticism of President Trump’s strategy for ending the war in Ukraine comes after the United States voted with Russia and its allies, such as North Korea and Belarus, against a United Nations resolution condemning Russian aggression toward Ukraine and calling for the withdrawal of its troops from the country.

While GOP senators were willing to grant Trump broad deference on his controversial Cabinet nominees, they are doubling down in blaming Russia for starting the war and warning the president to approach Putin warily in any negotiation.

Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) blasted the American opposition to the U.N. resolution condemning Russian aggression.

“Yesterday’s vote by the U.S. against the U.N. resolution was shameful,” she said Tuesday.

The measure, which received the backing of NATO allies, passed the U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly despite the U.S. opposition.

The United States instead backed a resolution that called for immediate peace in Ukraine but made no mention of Russia’s invasion for starting the conflict.

Collins said she agreed with Sen. Mitch McConnell’s (R-Ky.) statement marking the third anniversary of the war, in which the former Senate GOP leader said refusing to blame Russia “as the undeniable and unprovoked aggressor” in the conflict “reflects a gross misunderstanding of the nature of negotiations and leverage.”

Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah) said he was “deeply troubled” that the U.S. voted Monday with Russia and North Korea and against traditional allies such as Britain and France, which supported the resolution condemning Russia and calling for a restoration of Ukraine’s borders.

“I was deeply troubled by the vote at the UN today, which puts us on the same side as Russia and North Korea. These are not our friends. This posture is a dramatic shift from American ideals of freedom and democracy,” Curtis said in a post on social media.

He warned that any end to the war “must be achieved on terms that ensure Ukraine’s sovereignty and security” and “deter” Putin from future territorial aggression.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) on Tuesday marked the third anniversary of Russia’s “unprovoked war on Ukraine.”

“We all want this senseless war to end, but ending it on Russia’s terms would be a devastating mistake that plays right into Putin’s bloody hands,” Murkowski posted on social media.

She later noted Trump has “the authority” to pursue a peace deal but warned that any such deal would be “unacceptable” if Putin sets the terms.

“The president clearly has the ability, has the authority to be negotiating. But I think many of us have suggested that negotiating peace on Putin’s terms is not acceptable,” she told reporters.

Some of the strongest pushback in the conference came from McConnell, who now leads the Senate’s Appropriations defense subcommittee.

“America is right to seek an end to this war, but an end that fails to constrain Russian ambition, ensure Ukrainian sovereignty or strengthen American credibility with both allies and adversaries is no end at all. Instead, such a hollow peace would invite further aggression,” he said in a statement Monday.

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said he “disagreed” with the U.S. vote against the resolution condemning Russian aggression.

“Putin is a murderer who’s ordered the systematic capture, kidnapping, rape and torture of countless numbers of Ukrainians,” he said. “That would have been my vote recommendation.”

He argued Putin can’t be trusted to uphold any peace deal, a warning echoed by other GOP lawmakers.

“Putin’s a liar and looking for the next opportunity to continue [Russia’s] march through Moldova and the west Balkans and everything else,” he warned.

Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he was “trying to understand” why the administration would oppose a resolution condemning Russia for the war.

“I’m trying to understand the negotiating strategy. I can imagine this was a strategic vote in order to negotiate a hasty and expeditious outcome to a horrible war,” he said. “I will withhold judgment or further comment until I learn more about that.”

But he said there’s no question that Russia is the aggressor in the war.

“I agree that Russia is the aggressor. I’m acknowledging it, and so many members of Congress are acknowledging that,” he said.

Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), speaking on the Senate floor, said Trump’s refusal to call out Putin as the aggressor has undermined U.S. leverage heading into the peace talks.

“The United States should have been willing to say this was an illegal war unjustly initiated by Russia. If you’re unwilling to state a truth, you begin in a very weak position,” he warned.

Other Republican senators pushed back on the reluctance of some high-ranking Trump administration officials to blame Russia for sparking the conflict three years ago.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in a “Fox News Sunday” interview told host Shannon Bream “it’s a very complicated question” when asked if it would be fair to say Russia attacked Ukraine without provocation.

On Tuesday, Stephen Feinberg, the co-founder of Cerberus Capital Management whom Trump has nominated to serve as the Pentagon’s No. 2-ranking official, declined to assign blame to Russia during his Senate confirmation hearing.

“I don’t feel that I should publicly comment in the middle of tense negotiations when I’m not privy to the facts,” he said when asked by Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) to confirm that Russia indeed invaded its neighbor.

Trump last week suggested Ukraine was primarily responsible for the war but later walked back his comment.

The president said last week that Ukraine “should have never started the war” but later modified his statement by acknowledging “Russia attacked.”

Trump stirred some concern among defense hawk Republicans by refusing to call Putin a dictator when asked Monday about his comments last week calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a “dictator without elections.”

“I don’t use those words lightly,” he said when asked whether he views Putin as a dictator.

Several Republican senators Tuesday, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.), avowed that Russia is solely to blame for the conflict.

“We’re not confused about the facts. That is a fact,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said.

Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) said “Russia’s clearly the aggressor.”

He pointed to quote from the 1946 Nuremberg Trials International Military Tribunal he had posted on social media in response to the U.S. voting against the U.N. resolution condemning Russia.

“To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole,” it read.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a close Trump ally and prominent voice on national security issues, said “Russia is the aggressor.”

Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) last week rejected Trump’s lenient view of Putin, telling CNN in an interview that the Russian president is a “war criminal who should be in jail for life.”

On Tuesday, Wicker told CNN that “it’s clear to most Americans that this war was started by Vladimir Putin’s aggression” dating back as far as 2014, when Russia invaded and seized Crimea.

“It seems to me that multiple administrations have not been as firm as we should have been,” he said.",Center,True
Dumb Things Socialists Promise,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-26-0425/politics-dumb-things-socialists-promise,John Stossel,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/john-stossel,Lean Right,https://townhall.com/columnists/johnstossel/2025/02/26/dumb-things-socialists-promise-n2652858,"Socialism is popular!

A Pew study reports that more than a third of American adults view it positively.

How is this possible?

Little has brought more misery -- first in the Soviet Union, then in China, Cuba, Nicaragua, now Venezuela ...

One reason young people support socialism is because their social media feeds show videos made by popular but economically illiterate people.

TikTok star Madeline Pendleton has 1.6 million subscribers. My new video shows her telling them: ""Socialism is working better than capitalism 93% of the time!""

Where does she get 93%?

From a study published in 1986 by self-described Marxists in the Journal of Health Services.

The authors conveniently ignore the United States and other wealthy countries and compare socialist economies to ""capitalist"" countries like Uganda, Rwanda, and Somalia, some of which were at war.

It's so stupid. But based on that, Pendleton tells her followers, ""We have all the data showing that socialism does work.""

She also celebrates communism because of its ""increased life expectancy.""

That's nonsense, too. People live longest in capitalist countries like Japan (85 years) and South Korea (84 years). Even in the United States (79 years), where more of us die young because we drive more (car accidents), eat more, shoot each other more often, and try more dangerous drugs, we still live longer than people in China (78 years).

Socialism is also superior, says Pendleton, because of ""the 90-100% home-ownership rates.""

""One hundred percent,"" of course, is just dumb, but China (if you believe the party's statistics) does have 90% homeownership.

But not under socialism! They achieved that only after privatizing urban housing. Before 1998, when Chinese housing was still socialist, just 20% of Chinese people owned homes.

Several social media stars rave about China. ""Socialism worked in China!"" says TikToker Dante Munoz. ""They lifted over 800 million people from poverty.""

Again, it's true that in the last 50 years, China's GDP went from $156 per capita to more than $12,000. But that only happened after China gave up on real socialism and started embracing markets. Hong Kong, which adopted actual capitalism, raised per capita GDP to $50,000.

Before China reformed, millions of people died of starvation.

Another silly social media star, JT Chapman, tells his almost 2 million YouTube subscribers: ""The central idea that unites all socialists is maximizing freedom ... democratization of power.""

Democratization? In most socialist countries, there's only one political party.

A popular TikToker calling himself Rathbone tells his hundred thousand subscribers: ""capitalism ... prioritizes profits over people ... (but) socialism ... prioritizes people over profits.""

Likewise, Chapman says socialism offers the ""guaranteed right to ... health care, food and shelter.""

Well, socialism promises those things and claims to prioritize people over profits, but what people actually get is different.

As Cuban doctors put it in this video, ""The Cuban health care system is destroyed ... People are dying in the hallways.""

Yet Chapman claims, ""Innovation can flourish even when people are not motivated by profit. The USSR gave the world the anthrax vaccine, artificial satellites and one of the earliest mobile phones.""

That is true. But no one uses those phones today. Capitalism just creates much more.

Finally, Chapman says, ""Ownership should be collective.""

Collective ownership does feel good. ""We'll share everything!""

But every attempt at collective ownership has failed.

One famous American example: 200 years ago, New Harmony, Indiana, abolished private property, promising a ""community of equality.""

The result was famine.

When people realized they could receive just as much barely working as they could working hard, many, naturally, worked less. Within a year, the commune experiment failed, and the property was returned to private hands.

What do these popular social media stars say when I confront them with these inconvenient truths? Sadly, I don't know. Not one would appear on Stossel TV to debate.

The bottom line: Incentives matter. No one washes a rental car. Few people care much about what belongs to everyone. It's just human nature.

Capitalism isn't perfect, but if we want a better future and freedom, capitalism is the only thing that works.

Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images Dan Crenshaw And Tucker Carlson's Relationship Explained The feud between Crenshaw and Carlson dates back several years and is rooted in their differing approaches to conservative politics. Carlson, a former Fox News host, has criticized Crenshaw over the representative's support for U.S. military aid to Ukraine in its war against Russia. The duo has targeted one another on social media. Per Politico, Carlson once mocked Crenshaw as one of ""the dumbest"" Republicans . Crenshaw had called Carlson a ""cowardly, know-nothing elitist."" One notable clash occurred in 2022, when Carlson questioned Crenshaw's support for U.S. military aid to Ukraine, referring to him as ""Eyepatch McCain""—a reference to the late Senator John McCain , known for his hawkish foreign policy. Crenshaw condemned the comment as disrespectful to wounded veterans and accused Carlson of prioritizing entertainment over serious political discourse. Carlson also targeted Crenshaw last year concerning the bill placing restrictions on the social media platform TikTok , owned by Chinese company ByteDance. On March 15, 2024, Carlson shared a clip on X of Crenshaw outside the U.S. Capitol, speaking about privacy and data protection. Carlson wrote: ""Crenshaw tells reporter Liam Cosgrove that U.S. intel agencies don't meddle in domestic news coverage, when of course he knows that's untrue. Watch his face as he says it. Liar.""

Uncertainty grows over future of Africa-US trade deal under Trump,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-25-1935/foreign-policy-uncertainty-grows-over-future-africa-us-trade-deal-under-trump,Semafor,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/semafor-media-bias,Lean Left,https://www.semafor.com/article/02/24/2025/uncertainty-grows-over-future-of-africa-us-trade-deal-under-trump,"In 2023, US imports under AGOA topped $9.7 billion, down from $10.2 billion the previous year. The arrangement, which allows eligible African countries and businesses to export goods to the US under favorable tariff-free terms, was dominated that year by $4.2 billion in crude oil trade. It also included around $1.1 billion in apparel and over $900 million in agricultural products.

The US Congress is responsible for approving the next iteration of the act, which has typically commanded bipartisan support. But there is uncertainty about its future this time around, not least because of the tone of the debates around free trade in Washington. Trump’s “America First Trade Policy” executive order on Jan. 20 has called on the US Trade Representative, the Treasury department, and the Commerce department to review all United States trade deals. Some analysts are awaiting the outcome of that review on April 1 to determine AGOA’s future.

AD

“The idea of a preferential trade deal is a difficult one in the current environment. And given the executive order, it leaves a question mark on AGOA’s future,” said Frannie Léautier, who authored an Atlantic Council report in 2023 calling for AGOA’s early renewal. It could boil down to making a practical case in AGOA’s favor, showing that tariffs are more costly than preferential trade for US companies. “That might help,” said Léautier.

The uncertainty around AGOA is surprising because while there are differences of opinion around technical details, the trade act has always received bipartisan support in Congress and from White House administrations of either stripe.

Even Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, which is broadly believed to be a rough blueprint for Trump’s policy approach, offered fairly standard language about AGOA ahead of last November’s election.

AD

But AGOA seems to have been caught up in the shock and awe furor around the dismantling of USAID and no one is certain anymore what might happen. “I don’t know” was the most common response I got in recent days when I spoke to Africa analysts and Congress aides. A few months earlier it was “when” not “if.”

To be clear, while AGOA has had some wins, it has not been the kind of rip-roaring success that has driven African imports to grow exponentially every year. The $9.7 billion AGOA imports to the US last year was a miserly share of the $3.9 trillion of global US imports.

And yet, even in this Trump 2.0-era of Washington upheaval, there is an optimistic take that’s beginning to crystallize. This is that forcing AGOA to be seen as a transactional opportunity for the US as much as for Africa will help break the program away from its development partnership roots. If successful, the optimistic view is it could finally start to be transformative for more African countries.

South Africa has been in the eye of the storm with regards to US relations in recent weeks in a range of sensitive geopolitical and domestic policy issues. AGOA came into focus as one of the levers that might be used against South Africa when four US congressmen called for its eligibility to be revoked.

This is particularly significant because South Africa, the continent’s most industrialized economy, is the largest beneficiary of the free trade program through which it exports cars, citrus fruits, wine, and textiles worth nearly $2 billion annually to the US.

Neil Diamond, president of the South African Chamber of Commerce in the US, told Semafor: “The biggest immediate concern is uncertainty, which discourages investment, disrupts supply chains, and forces businesses to consider alternative markets.”",Center,False

"As G.O.P. Eyes Medicaid Cuts, States Could be Left With Vast Shortfalls",https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-25-1302/healthcare-gop-eyes-medicaid-cuts-states-could-be-left-vast-shortfalls,New York Times (News),https://www.allsides.com/news-source/new-york-times,Lean Left,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/politics/medicaid-cuts-republican-budget.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare,"House Republicans hunting for ways to pay for President Trump’s tax cuts have called for cutting the federal government’s share of Medicaid spending, including a proposal that would effectively gut the Affordable Care Act’s 2014 expansion of the program.

Cutting Medicaid spending, which is expected to be central to fulfilling the budget plan that House Republicans adopted Tuesday night, could result in millions of Americans across the country losing health coverage unless states decide to play a bigger role in its funding.

Federal and state governments share the costs of Medicaid, which is a public health insurance program largely for low-income people.

Republicans are considering lowering the 90 percent share that the federal government is required to pay to states that enroll participants in the expansion. The change could generate $560 billion in savings over a decade, money that Republicans want to use toward extending Mr. Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, which are set to expire at the end of 2025. Extending the tax cuts is expected to cost $4.5 trillion, meaning Republicans will have to find savings beyond Medicaid from a long menu of options.

A move to lower federal spending on the Medicaid expansion population could effectively gut the program. Around 10 states that have expanded their programs have so-called trigger laws that reverse the Medicaid expansion if the federal government decreases funding for the population.

The change could leave the 40 states that participate in the Obamacare program with a difficult set of choices. They could shoulder the extra costs to preserve Medicaid coverage for millions, make cuts to coverage or look for cuts from other large government programs to offset the reduction in federal funds.

Medicaid, which covers more than 70 million people, is the largest health insurance program in the nation, and the largest single source of funding for states. More than 21 million adults who were not eligible for Medicaid under pre-expansion guidelines received coverage last year. The program had previously restricted enrollment primarily to those who were pregnant, disabled or elderly.

Among those who qualified for Medicaid under the expansion was Jeannie Brown, a 60-year-old part-time bus driver for the public school system in Belgrade, Mont. Ms. Brown went more than five years without health insurance beginning in 2009, avoiding medical care as her health deteriorated and she cared for her disabled granddaughter.

Ms. Brown, who makes around $25,000 each year, had been trapped in the so-called coverage gap, with a salary too high for Medicaid, and too low for a heavily subsidized Obamacare plan.

After Montana lawmakers voted in 2015 to take up the Affordable Care Act’s option to expand Medicaid to cover more adults, Ms. Brown enrolled. She began to see a primary care doctor, and Medicaid paid for hand surgeries, knee replacements, a double mastectomy and her inhaler, she said.

“Being a caregiver is extremely exhausting, especially with someone who has a lot of health needs,” she said last week from a children’s hospital in Colorado, where her granddaughter had been flown for emergency care. “If I didn’t have the preventative care I needed, I’d be in a much worse place physically. I’d probably be disabled.”

Conservative critics of Medicaid expansion have argued that it forces the federal government to spend exorbitantly, and disproportionately, to cover health services for a population Medicaid was not intended to serve.

“The higher federal match for able-bodied adults creates perverse incentives to divert funds from more vulnerable populations,” said Michael Cannon, the director of health policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.

Republicans have also pointed to what they say is unanticipated runaway Medicaid spending. Some states have seen unexpected surges in Medicaid costs in recent years, in part because many Americans delayed care during the coronavirus pandemic. Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, recently proposed a $2.5 billion increase in state spending on the program.

The move to pare back the federal government’s financial commitments to Medicaid could profoundly reshape how it shares responsibility with states to offer health care to some of the poorest Americans, as well as the providers and nursing homes that care for them.

The change would amount to a “massive transfer of the financial responsibility from the federal government to states,” said Daniel Tsai, who oversaw Medicaid under former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.

“You’d have states having enormous budget holes making decisions between how to do the right thing to keep people covered” and how to preserve other programs, he said. “States are going to be cash strapped.”

Medicaid expansion has become a deeply bipartisan project over the past decade, underscoring the Affordable Care Act’s reach in the American health system and its appeal even to Republican governors and state lawmakers who once opposed it. Much of the additional enrollment comes from Republican-led states where voters passed ballot initiatives to enact the program.

Medicaid now funds almost half of all births in the United States, and represents more than half of spending on long-term care. More than 70 percent of Americans say they want Medicaid to stay as it is, according to a survey conducted last year by KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group.

Senator Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told HuffPost last week that he had filed an amendment to a Senate budget resolution prohibiting cuts from Medicaid. After his state expanded the program in 2021, more than 300,000 low-income residents joined the rolls.

Representative Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican, said on Sunday that lawmakers may focus on imposing a national work requirement on Medicaid, a controversial proposal that would amount to only a fraction of the cuts congressional Republicans are seeking. Ohio recently asked the Trump administration for permission to test out the policy.

Jon Tester, the former Democratic senator from Montana, said that Medicaid cuts could have a more sweeping effect on rural America than urban areas because of how the program sustains impoverished areas with few health providers. “And that’s an interesting conundrum because most of rural America is a much deeper red than urban America,” he said.

“If you take away health care, you can’t live there,” Mr. Tester said.

Republicans are also considering limiting how much the federal government spends on a state’s Medicaid program, a practice known as block granting or per capita caps. That strategy could save as much as $900 billion over a decade.

If states picked up the costs from the federal government and kept their expansion populations in place, they would spend more than $600 billion to do so over a decade, an increase of almost 20 percent, according to KFF. Many states would be short more than $10 billion over a decade, and some larger states, such as New York and California, would face a shortfall of more than $50 billion.

With Montana’s expansion program set to expire in June, a group of state lawmakers there advanced legislation last week that would extend the program, in part to keep health providers in the heavily rural state solvent. Roughly 80,000 people in the state now have coverage through the state’s expansion, drastically lowering the state’s uninsured rate.

But like in other states, Montana’s Medicaid expansion has been preserved in part because of strong Republican support in the state Legislature. One Republican state senator in favor of Medicaid expansion, Russ Tempel, said that it had increased behavioral health services in the state and was keeping the few hospitals in his rural district afloat.

Matt Regier, the Republican president of the Montana Senate, said that hospitals in the state had become too reliant on Medicaid, and that its expansion was “incentivizing people to not stand on their own two feet.”

“That’s the opposite of what a government safety net should be,” he said.

In Illinois, another state with a trigger law, roughly a quarter of the state’s Medicaid program is part of the expansion population, and the state’s uninsured rate dropped by 44 percent after the expansion took effect, said Alex Gough, a spokesman for Gov.

“Threats to coverage would spell catastrophe,” he said. He added that eliminating the Medicaid expansion “would cause major disruption to the state’s health care infrastructure that relies on Medicaid funding and, ultimately, its economy.”

Democratic legislators in Virginia are trying to protect Medicaid by getting rid of the trigger provision. State officials are also girding for a new wave of enrollment from laid-off federal workers.

“I’m not confident Virginia would be able to provide full coverage” with drastically lower federal funding, said Ghazala Hashmi, a Democratic state senator who has proposed a new committee to study the issue. “That is not a burden a state budget could bear.”",Left,False

Share Copy Link ✓ Link copied to clipboard! Something is fundamentally broken in America. And you can get a hint of it in the way Americans think about and interact with news about the world. Especially news about politics. A fascinating new study from public opinion firm Change Research puts its finger on the problem: ""navigating a sea of bias, sensationalism, and misinformation exhausts and annoys significant portions of voters."" The researchers show that it's this basic aggravation with the way we get information that is at the core of a lot of voter behavior. Americans have grown weary; not just of the news, but also of the entire miserable chore of learning about it. Which explains the stunning statistic that the share of Americans saying they closely follow news dropped 13 points in the past eight years, and that today, only one-third of us pay any real attention to the world around us. Like singles on a dating app wading through a sea of creeps, duds, and weirdos until they quiet-quit the dating pool out of sheer exasperation, people are opting out of news out of frustrated fatigue. Pedestrians walk past a newspaper vending machine as it lies next to the PNI Building, which housed the Philadelphia Inquirer in 2006 in Philadelphia.

William Thomas Cain/Getty Images Except that when Americans swipe left on current events, the consequences are a lot more disastrous . President Donald Trump actually won the last election only because so few voters were paying attention: voters who said they barely follow news favored him by 19 points in 2024; those who follow news ""a great deal"" favored Vice President Kamala Harris by 6. Those Americans seeing the past month of chaos , rising prices, surrender to our enemies, and the trail of death and disease that Trump has created might be screaming, like Adam Sandler in The Wedding Singer , that they wish all of this had been brought to their attention yesterday... as in, before the election. Except it was. Anyone taking even a little bit of interest knew this was coming. As voters in a republic who are supposed exercise self-determination, that's on us. Mostly. But it's also on the media. Because they're the ones who are supposed to help the citizenry make informed decisions so that we can govern ourselves. And they're the ones that have made reading news feel like jumping into the trash compactor in Star Wars : wading through muck, waiting for some cyclopean alien eel to jump out and drown you.

It depends on whether media organizations figure out the secret. What they need to see is that the thing that is ultimately broken in America is trust. Stacks of research show that trust in institutions has been cratering and news media are among the biggest losers in the great American confidence die-off. But there are a few clever media entities that are thriving right now, and it's highly likely that a major reason is that they've recognized ways to address some of the root causes —perceptions of bias, sensationalism, misinformation, and financial motivations—behind people's loss of faith. For example, the Philadelphia Inquirer is tackling reader skepticism of media motivations by leaning into their not-for-profit ownership as a contrast to their competitors. They've successfully branded themselves as a paper that's more willing to shoot straight with readers because they're less driven by the balance sheet. That differentiation directly attacks one of the biggest sources of loss of reader trust—the feeling that what they're reading is dripping with sensationalism. Articles look less like click-bait if the newspaper doesn't seem like it has quite the same need to chase clicks. Substack is following a different trust-based model, and it's clearly resonating . It allows subscribers to develop a direct, social media-like connection with creators, so they can feel like they are getting more unvarnished analysis with less suspicion of platform owner bias. Creators also often mix the DIY Substack vibe with the name-brand professionalism of big-name-media by straddling both worlds. The smarter media outlets have seen this as a good thing, a win-win way to build greater reader trust for themselves by tapping into the creators' direct audience connection. Both of us are becoming such straddlers, and one of us (Schecter), a former Daily Beast columnist, is literally starting his own Substack right now (feel free to come give feedback on this article in his 12-hour livestream happening today, or hit Robison's ). To be sure, this list is neither complete nor perfect, and these steps are necessary but may not be sufficient. But the take-home is clear: if news media is going to reverse the tune-out trend—which is something this country desperately needs—the table stakes are being much clearer about getting biases out in the open and helping people feel like they at least know what they're getting. And they can't just hope that it will happen; Walter Cronkite ain't walking through that door, so they've got to work for it... If they do, the marketplace may even reward them.

Federal judge rules Trump administration has to pay millions in foreign aid to nonprofits,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-25-1249/donald-trump-federal-judge-rules-trump-administration-has-pay-millions-foreign,ABC News (Online),https://www.allsides.com/news-source/abc-news-media-bias,Lean Left,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/federal-judge-rules-trump-administration-pay-millions-foreign/story?id=119173659,"The U.S. Supreme Court temporarily delayed a court-mandated deadline requiring the Trump administration to pay nearly $2 billion to contracted aid organizations for work they already completed.

Chief Justice John Roberts, in an order Wednesday night, stayed a lower court order that the administration pay out $1.9 billion by midnight. In his order, Roberts asked the aid groups that sued the Trump administration to provide a response by noon Friday after which the court will decide its next steps.

Roberts' order came after the Trump administration sought emergency intervention by the high court after a panel of federal appeals court judges denied the administration's earlier request to push the deadline.

Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris asked the justices to impose an administrative stay -- freezing the status quo for a short time.

""What the government cannot do is pay arbitrarily determined demands on an arbitrary timeline of the district court’s choosing or according to extra-contractual rules that the court has devised,"" Harris wrote in the emergency request, saying the deadline created ""an untenable payment plan"" at odds with the president's obligations.

""The order appears to contemplate the immediate outlay of nearly $2 billion. And the government has no sure mechanism to recover wrongfully disbursed funds delivered to entities that claim to be near insolvency,"" Harris said in the request.

In proceedings earlier Wednesday denying a request to stay his deadline, U.S. District Court Judge Amir Ali, a Biden-era appointee, balked at the government's insistence that it couldn't meet the midnight payout deadline and criticized the Trump administration for waiting until Tuesday to raise the argument that they lack the ability to restart the funding.

""This is not something that Defendants have previously raised in this Court, whether at the hearing or any time before filing their notice of appeal and seeking a stay pending appeal. That is so even though Plaintiffs' motion to enforce explicitly proposed compliance on this time frame,"" Ali wrote.

On Tuesday, Ali had ordered the Trump administration to dole out delayed payments that could total nearly $2 billion, according to a USAID official, to multiple nonprofit groups, determining the Trump administration violated the terms of a temporary restraining order issued two weeks ago regarding freezing foreign aid.

A top official with the United States Agency for International Development claimed that complying with Tuesday's court order would require paying foreign aid groups nearly $2 billion, arguing the payments ""cannot be accomplished"" in the timeframe set by the court.

Lawyers with the Department of Justice asked Ali in a late-night filing on Tuesday to issue a stay of his order that requires the Trump administration to pay by Wednesday at 11:59 p.m. any outstanding debts to foreign aid groups for work completed prior to Feb. 13. The Trump administration initially tried to freeze the payments via an executive order before Judge Ali ordered the payments to resume two weeks ago.

DOJ lawyers argued that fulfilling the payments is not only technically impossible but would also prevent the Trump administration from ensuring the payments are ""legitimate.""

""The order apparently requires the Government to expend taxpayer dollars without regard to any processes for ensuring that the expenses are legitimate—even though Executive Branch leadership harbors concerns about the possibility of waste and fraud and is in the process of developing revised payment processing systems to address those concerns,"" DOJ attorney Indraneel Sur wrote in a late-night filing.

According to Peter Marocco, the deputy administrator of USAID and director of foreign assistance at the State Department, complying with the court order would require dispersing $1.5 billion between 2,000 payment requests at USAID and an additional $400 million in payments at the State Department.

Earlier this week, Judge Ali excoriated Trump administration attorneys during a lengthy hearing over its failure to pay the groups for work they conducted prior to President Trump's Jan. 20 executive order, which froze all foreign aid for 90 days. Ali also signed an order to enforce a temporary restraining order he signed on Feb. 13, ruling the groups must be paid by 11:59 p.m. Wednesday.

""Plaintiffs submitted evidence that defendants have not lifted the suspension or freeze of funds as the [temporary restraining order] required. Defendants have not rebutted that evidence, and when asked today, defendants were not able to provide any specific examples of unfreezing funds pursuant to the Court's TRO,"" Judge Ali said after a two-hour hearing today.

Lawyers with the Department of Justice acknowledged that the Trump administration ignored the temporary restraining order, which prohibited them from freezing foreign aid funds since the order was issued. Instead, they argued that they should not be required to pay back the money because of ""sovereign immunity.""

During an extended exchange with Ali, a DOJ lawyer struggled to answer basic questions about the Trump administration's compliance with the temporary restraining order, which prevented the administration from freezing funds.

""I'm not sure why I can't get a straight answer from you on this. Are you aware of an unfreezing of the disbursement of funds for those contracts and agreements that were frozen before February 13?"" Ali asked. ""Are you aware of steps taken to actually release those funds?""

""I'm not in a position to answer that,"" DOJ attorney Indraneel Sur said.

""We're 12 days in and you're here representing the government...and you can't answer me whether any funds that you've kind of acknowledged or covered by the court's order have been unfrozen?"" Judge Ali responded.

""All I can do, really, is say that the preparations are underway for the joint status report on compliance,"" Sur said.

At one portion of the lengthy court hearing, Sur attempted to offer a legal justification for the Trump administration's noncompliance, prompting a stern response from the judge about his order, the terms of which he said were ""clear as day.""

""The purpose of this hearing is to understand and to hear arguments on the motion to enforce TRO. It is not an opportunity to re-litigate the TRO,"" Ali said.

A lawyer representing the nonprofits who brought the case argued that the lack of a response from the Trump administration amounts to defiance of the court order.

""What the court's colloquy with the government has revealed is that the government has done nothing to make the flow of payments happen,"" he said. ""As far as we are aware, there's been zero directives from the agency with respect to the unfreezing of funds.""",Center,False
Are Republican voters turning on DOGE?,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-25-1224/politics-are-republican-voters-turning-doge,UnHerd,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/unherd-media-bias,Center,https://unherd.com/newsroom/are-republican-voters-turning-on-doge/,"In 2009, raucous town halls for Democratic members of Congress were a sign that Barack Obama’s “hope and change” agenda risked a public backlash. Now, it’s elected Republicans who star in viral-video town halls, as they parry complaints from an enraged crowd. Many of these complaints have focused on cuts to federal programmes as well as DOGE layoffs, and they have put some Republicans on the defensive. One Republican House member, for instance, told NBC News that he wanted to see more “compassion” from the administration going forward.

To some extent, town halls are political theatre, and progressive activists have recognised in them an opportunity to hold Republicans’ feet to the fire. But they are also part of a growing pool of evidence that the sweeping disruption of the first month of the Trump administration has started to generate some resistance. Elected in part out of dissatisfaction with the economy of the Joe Biden years, the new regime cannot afford to take its eye off kitchen-table issues.

Beyond these town halls, some polling has raised red flags. While Trump remains more popular than during his first term (as well as considerably more popular than Biden in the closing year of his presidency), his numbers have dipped a bit over the first month of his presidency. Even more importantly, approval for his economic policies has also fallen in polling. A CNN poll published last week found that 51% of Americans thought the President had gone “too far” in cutting the federal government — and 62% believed that he was not doing enough to tackle inflation. Economic anxiety can be read in other measures, too. The consumer-confidence index dropped from January to February and remains well below where it was during most of Trump’s pre-pandemic presidency.

It’s obviously too early to judge the new administration’s economic programme, or to expect its agenda to have already had a major effect on inflation. But that polling does indicate where the public’s priorities lie. The Right-wing X echo chamber might delight in battles with the “deep state”, but the majority of swing voters turned to Trump in 2024 in part because of their warm memories of the economy during his first presidency. That gives him some goodwill now that he has resumed office, but it also means that voters expect him to deliver.

Trump was partly able to take over the Republican Party almost a decade ago because of the unpopularity of the austerity agenda which had become ascendant during the Tea Party era. Voters consistently backed away from the GOP when its talk about “limited government” transformed into proposals to slash federal programmes, especially entitlements. Sweeping federal cuts today could actually revive the pains that austerity inflicted on Republican electoral prospects. If the cuts seem erratic and haphazard, public sentiment could turn quickly.

DOGE’s allies insist that the growing US debt burden needs to be confronted. However, taking America’s fiscal challenges seriously only adds to the importance of not allowing administrative battles to get in the way of a bigger economic programme. Robust, broadly shared economic growth alleviates fiscal pressures and gives policymakers credibility when proposing bigger reforms. The last time that the United States tamed its deficit and took its debt burden on a long-term downward trajectory was in the late Nineties, when the go-go economy filled federal coffers and family bank accounts. For decades, recessions have caused a spike in deficit spending.",Center,True
"Supreme Court overturns Richard Glossip conviction, orders new trial",https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-25-1154/criminal-justice-supreme-court-overturns-richard-glossip-conviction-orders-new,Washington Examiner,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/washington-examiner,Lean Right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/supreme-court/3329384/supreme-court-overturns-richard-glossip-conviction/#google_vignette,"The ruling in Glossip v. Oklahoma overturns the conviction of a defendant who has spent more than two decades on death row and sends the case back for a new trial.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the majority and joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, highlighted the prosecution’s failure to correct false testimony from the state’s key witness, Justin Sneed.

“Because the prosecution violated its constitutional obligations under Napue v. Illinois by knowingly allowing false testimony to go uncorrected, Mr. Glossip is entitled to a new trial,” Sotomayor wrote, referring to the error that took place in Glossip’s case at the state court level.

The majority opinion emphasized newly uncovered evidence that Sneed, who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and prescribed lithium, falsely testified that he had never seen a psychiatrist. Sotomayor noted that Oklahoma prosecutors not only knew this testimony was false but failed to correct it during Glossip’s trial — an omission that could have influenced the jury’s verdict given that Sneed’s testimony was the only direct link implicating Glossip in the 1997 murder of motel owner Barry Van Treese.

Justice Neil Gorsuch, who served on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overseeing Oklahoma cases, recused himself from the decision.

In dissent, Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito criticized the majority’s reliance on new evidence presented long after the trial, arguing that the false testimony was immaterial to the outcome. Thomas, joined by Alito and partially by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, contended that the defense failed to challenge Sneed’s testimony effectively during the trial and that the evidence against Glossip remained strong despite the inconsistencies.

Thomas said the majority “stretches the law at every turn to rule in his favor,” referring to Glossip. Barrett said she would not have ordered the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals to set aside Glossip’s conviction and that she would rather have corrected the state court’s “misstatement of Napue” and sent the case back for further proceedings.

SUPREME COURT APPEARS DIVIDED OVER OKLAHOMA DEATH ROW APPEAL

The decision on Monday comes after years of legal challenges and a rare admission from Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, a Republican, who supported Glossip’s petition for a new trial after an independent investigation revealed withheld evidence and concerns about the integrity of the prosecution’s case.

Glossip, who has spent over two decades on death row, now awaits a new trial in Oklahoma state court. The ruling marks a significant victory for death penalty reform advocates and raises fresh questions about prosecutorial conduct in capital cases.",Center,False
"Supreme Court turns back challenges to laws keeping abortion opponents away from clinics, patients",https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-25-0748/abortion-supreme-court-turns-back-challenges-laws-keeping-abortion-opponents,Associated Press,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/associated-press-media-bias,Left,https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-abortion-buffer-zones-7979c3d747d7eab88f7e8b723397e768,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court refused Monday to hear a pair of cases from abortion opponents who say laws limiting anti-abortion demonstrations near clinics violate their First Amendment rights.

The majority did not explain their reasoning for turning down the appeals, as is typical, but two conservative justices, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, disagreed.

The cities said the laws were passed to address disturbing behavior from protesters outside of health care clinics. But anti-abortion activists said the measures violate free-speech rights and should be on their “deathbed” after the justices overturned Roe v. Wade and the nationwide right to abortion.

One case comes from Carbondale, Illinois, which is located near the state’s southern border and passed an ordinance after becoming a destination for patients from nearby states with abortion bans. The measure was quickly challenged in court, and has never been enforced. The city argued the appeal should be tossed because the ordinance was repealed shortly before abortion opponents went to the Supreme Court.

The other case is from New Jersey, where activist Jeryl Turco says she has approached women in Englewood for years to try to convince them not to have abortions. She says an 8-foot demonstration-free zone the city passed in 2014 in response to an aggressive group of protesters also wrongly kept her from approaching women.

Englewood argues that Turco has still been able to share her message outside of the immediate area near clinic entrances. Lower courts have ultimately upheld the ordinance, finding it isn’t a major First Amendment burden.

Both challengers pointed out that the high court struck down a Massachusetts law creating 35-foot demonstration free “buffer zones” around clinic doors in 2014. They say the Illinois and New Jersey laws should meet the same fate.

But cities say their rules are in line with a different Supreme Court decision from 2000, when the high court allowed a Colorado law to stand. It barred people from getting within 8 feet of others without permission in a 100-foot “bubble zone” around clinics.

Thomas said that case, known as Hill v. Colorado, was wrongly decided. In a dissent from the decision to decline the Illinois case, he said that the court wrongly treated it differently than other First Amendment cases because abortion was involved. “Hill has been seriously undermined, if not completely eroded, and our refusal to provide clarity is an abdication of our judicial duty,” he wrote.",Center,False

"Before it was shuttered, USAID routed funds to Soros-aligned causes, terrorists and drag queens",https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-25-0745/politics-it-was-shuttered-usaid-routed-funds-soros-aligned-causes-terrorists,Just The News,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/just-news-media-bias,Lean Right,https://justthenews.com/accountability/political-ethics/it-was-shuttered-usaid-routed-funds-soros-causes-terrorists-and,"Before the Trump administration closed USAID’s doors, the agency regularly routed funding to causes aligned with George Soros’ nonprofit empire, terrorists and drag queens.

The agency came under scrutiny from the new administration over failures to ensure transparency in its funding to organizations across the globe and concerns that the leadership was not responding to explicit policy directives from the State Department and the wider executive branch to align its programs with Trump policies and the U.S. national interest.

In recent days, the Trump administration identified USAID programs ranging from contraceptives for Afghanistan to LGBT diversity programs for European countries as clear evidence that foreign aid needed to be paused and reevaluated, a task that fell to the Rubio State Department.

The development agency for years also funneled money to several nonprofit groups that also received substantial backing from components of George Soros’ empire. Some previously came under scrutiny during the Obama administration for “democracy promotion” and judicial reform efforts in European countries that critics claimed promoted leftist politics.

For example, U.S. government spending records show that the East-West Management Institute, which is in part backed by Soros’ Open Society Foundations, received more than $260 million over the years in grants from USAID to, among other things, promote the rule of law in Georgia, strengthen civil society in Uganda, and advance Serbia’s accession talks with the European Union.

That same nonprofit group came under scrutiny during the Obama administration after Judicial Watch uncovered government records and communications showing that the East-West Management Institute’s “Justice for All” campaign in Albania received $9 million in funding from USAID.

The assistance concerned several GOP Senators, who sent a letter to the newly appointed Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in 2017, alleging the campaign funded by the U.S. government helped craft an Albanian judicial reform proposal that may “give the Prime Minister and left-of-center government full control over the judiciary.”

Those same Senators also raised concerns about a similar Soros-backed program in neighboring Macedonia where they said a local affiliate called Foundation Open Society-Macedonia received backing from USAID through the Open Society Foundations and pushed “a progressive agenda.”

Other Soros-backed organizations that received funding from both his Open Society Foundations network and USAID include the Anti-Corruption Action Center in Ukraine and Transparency International.

According to the group's own records, the Anti-Corruption Action Center began receiving funding from USAID the same year the Maidan Revolution overthrew Ukraine’s elected, Russian-friendly President Viktor Yanukovych. The group, by its own admission, was heavily critical of Yanukovych’s government and ministers, which aligned with U.S. State Department policy at the time. During the 2014 Maidan Revolution, then-Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland visited Ukraine and was recorded on a leaked phone call discussing how the United States could influence the formation of a new government in Kyiv.

George Soros’ Open Society Foundations did not respond to a request for comment.

After temporarily shutting down USAID operation, the Trump administration defended the move, citing other left-wing causes that received funding grants from the agency. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt highlighted several when speaking with reporters on Monday, including $1.5 million for diversity measures in Serbia, $32,000 for a “transgender comic book” in Peru, and $70,000 for a DEI musical in Ireland.

House Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Brian Mast, R-Fla., also flagged other examples of USAID funding, including $15 million for condoms sent to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and over $3 million for “being LGBTQ in the Caribbean.”

The government watchdog overseeing the agency also warned USAID’s leadership in a stinging January memo that it had created serious ""vulnerabilities"" by doling out billions of tax dollars to overseas countries and groups without fulling vetting for terrorists. That inspector general’s report also determined that USAID grants were being insufficiently monitored.

In one egregious example, a Syrian national was charged by the Justice Department last year for diverting more than $9 million worth of humanitarian aid paid for by USAID to a designated terrorist group affiliated with Al-Qaeda in Iraq.

The suspect, Mahmoud Al Hafyan, was the head of a Syrian nongovernmental organization that employed 160 individuals and was awarded $122 million by USAID between January 2015 and November 2018, according to the Justice Department. That money was designated to pay for food kits for Syrian refugees fleeing conflict zones.

During this contract, the Justice Department alleges Al Hafyan worked with co-conspirators to funnel “millions” in food kits on the black market to the Al-Nusra Front, a local Al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria that is also designated a terrorist organization by the United States.

The USAID inspector general warned about the limits on the agency’s ability to monitor expenditures for programs in “nonpermissive” environments, like the conflict zones in Syria, meaning what happened there could happen in other places, like Ukraine or Gaza, where there are similar international or local organizations operating that are recipients of U.S. cash.",Right,False
What RFK Jr. has said about the ongoing measles outbreak,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-25-0540/healthcare-what-rfk-jr-has-said-about-ongoing-measles-outbreak,Vox,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/vox-news-media-bias,Left,https://www.vox.com/health/401130/texas-new-mexico-measles-rfk-hhs-response,"In early February, Texas health officials reported that measles was spreading among an insular religious community in Gaines County, Texas, where nearly 14 percent of schoolchildren have an exemption (granted in some states for reasons of conscience, including for religious beliefs) from the required childhood vaccinations. The disease has since been detected in a bordering New Mexico county. And this week, the case count grew to at least 124 people. Last year, the US saw 285 measles cases nationwide — the fourth-highest total since 2000.

The outbreak has escalated just as the US’s foremost vaccine skeptic, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has ascended as its top health care official. On February 26, the Texas health department reported the first death in the outbreak, an unvaccinated school-aged child.

Kennedy promises to probe the safety of childhood vaccines, and in his first actions as the new US Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary, Kennedy has already put vaccine advisory meetings on indefinite hold. He has helped cultivate a culture of skepticism toward medical science as the most prominent voice promoting a debunked link between childhood vaccinations and autism and other health issues — a view that corresponds to the re-emergence of measles over the past decade.

Kennedy is no longer an outside agitator but the government official ultimately responsible for squashing public health threats in the US.

So far, he has not commented on the Texas outbreak. But what happens next will be the first big test case for how Kennedy will lead the US health department during an active public health emergency.

How would the response to an outbreak normally look?

When there is a disease outbreak that requires government action (i.e., not your standard sniffles), local governments are the first responders. County officials are typically the first to receive reports of a disease spreading and they will start ramping up testing and other kinds of surveillance to assess the situation.

That was what happened in Texas: One Gaines County school district reported the first measles to their local community in late January. Within a week, the Texas state government stepped up once the outbreak had climbed to six cases, and began providing support for the local response. That’s also typical: While local authorities are on the front line, the state provides technical expertise, they may offer funding for communication and interventions (such as vaccine drive-throughs), and they otherwise serve as the top authority on how the response should be handled.

The feds usually stay in the background with an outbreak the size of the current measles occurrence. They can offer expert or laboratory support, for example. But otherwise, they are supporting players, unless the outbreak poses a unique threat to the rest of the nation or becomes a large multi-state crisis. For now, the current outbreak is limited to a small geographical region, and the states appear well aligned on how to respond.

But it is possible that further spread could demand federal officials get more involved — a development that would be worth watching closely, given its new leadership.

The good news: So far, RFK Jr.’s HHS isn’t complicating the response.

The outbreak was already underway before Kennedy was confirmed and, though it’s easy to forget after the pandemic, local authorities are taking the lead as they should. Texas health officials — and their counterparts in New Mexico, now that cases have begun to spread there — have set up mobile vaccination and testing sites, encouraging unvaccinated people to get their shots now. Because local officials are among the community they serve, they may be considered more trustworthy (and in turn they can ultimately be more effective).

If those efforts are allowed to continue unencumbered, that will be a hopeful sign that the RFK Jr.-led health department will not actively sabotage public health efforts when there is an acute crisis underway. After some observers pointed out that the CDC measles tracker had not been with the new outbreak, the web page was refreshed on Friday with a pledge to continue updating it every Friday.

So far, there is no sign that local officials have requested support from the federal government and been denied it.

Should I be worried about measles spreading more widely?

Not exactly. Such outbreaks are still relatively rare and, when they do occur, they usually stay localized. But America is trending in the wrong direction when it comes to this ancient disease, which can cause painful skin rashes and be deadly for young unvaccinated children.

The US declared measles eliminated in 2000. But it has regained a foothold as vaccination rates have dropped. In 2019, there was the largest outbreak in decades when more than 1,200 people became ill, mostly in New York. Now more than 120 individuals are sick along the border of Texas and New Mexico — larger than any outbreak last year and it is still only February.

Nationally, the measles vaccination rate has slipped just below the 95 percent target that experts say is necessary to maintain population-level immunity. In some states, the situation is more dire: 14 states had vaccination rates below 90 percent for the 2023–2024 school year, per the health policy think tank KFF.

But in individual communities, rates can slip even lower, creating the right conditions for an outbreak to explode; measles, after all, is one of the most contagious diseases known to man. In the Gaines County school district most affected by the outbreak, the vaccination rate is under 50 percent.

The vast majority of Americans still believe the measles vaccine is safe and effective, and its benefits outweigh any risks. But as our collective faith in science deteriorates, vaccination rates are also declining.

Closing summary

Our live coverage is ending now. In the meantime, you can find all of our live US politics coverage here. Here is a summary of the key developments from today:

A Trump-forward budget proposal imperiling Medicaid narrowly passed in the Republican-led House. The budget plan includes an estimated $800bn in potential cuts from Medicaid, a federal program providing healthcare coverage to more than 72 million Americans. The resolution also includes a $4.5tn in tax cuts and increased funding for defense and border security, offset by $2tn in spending reductions over the next decade.

Nearly 6,000 veterans have been fired across the federal government since the start of Donald Trump’s term, according to a new analysis by House Democrats. The report, compiled from data provided by the office of personnel management, estimates that roughly 38,000 federal workers have been fired since Trump took office last month and empowered Elon Musk’s ‘efficiency’ agency to dramatically reduce the federal workforce.

Trump has said that Volodymyr Zelenskyy is likely to visit the White House on Friday to sign a rare earth minerals deal to pay for US military aid to defend against Russia’s full-scale invasion. The announcement followed days of tense negotiations between the US and Ukraine in which Zelenskyy alleged the US was pressuring him to sign a deal worth more than $500bn that would force “ten generations” of Ukrainians to pay it back.

Trump reinstated a rule requiring cost transparency in healthcare. The rule requires hospitals to publish online the prices for some of their most common services, including MRI scans and caesarean section deliveries. The lack of transparency has often left patients shocked by medical bills.

Trump signed an executive order instructing the commerce secretary to launch an investigation into whether foreign copper production and imports threaten US economic and national security. According to White House officials, the investigation could lead to new tariffs on foreign copper, a material essential to manufacturing and construction, as well as critical to the US military and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence.

‘More than one million’ federal workers have responded to Elon Musk/Doge’s ultimatum email, the White House has claimed. Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, also said agency heads will “determine the best practices” for dealing with the ‘what did you do last week’ email in terms of whether people should respond and who, if anyone, would get fired. NBC News reported that responses to the email will reportedly be fed into an artificial intelligence system to determine whether their jobs are necessary.

In a significant shift of journalistic power, the White House press team will now decide which journalists and media outlets will make up the White House press pool. Leavitt said legacy outlets will still be allowed to join and participate in the press pool, but the “privilege” will also be extended to “new voices” from “well-deserving outlets”. It builds on the decision to revoke the Associated Press’s full access to presidential events over its continued use of “Gulf of Mexico” as opposed to “Gulf of America”.

Some 40% of the federal contracts the Trump administration claims to have canceled as part of its signature cost-cutting program aren’t expected to save the government any money, the administration’s own data shows. Doge last week published an initial list of 1,125 contracts that it terminated in recent weeks across the federal government. Data published on Doge’s “wall of receipts” shows that more than one-third of the contract cancellations, 417 in all, are expected to yield no savings.

Meanwhile, more than 20 civil service employees resigned from Doge, saying they were refusing to use their technical expertise to “dismantle critical public services. “We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the constitution across presidential administrations,” the 21 staffers wrote in a joint resignation letter, a copy of which was obtained by the Associated Press. “However, it has become clear that we can no longer honor those commitments.”

A federal judge in Seattle blocked the Trump administration’s effort to halt the nation’s refugee admissions system. US district judge Jamal Whitehead said in his ruling after the hearing on Tuesday that the president’s actions amounted to an “effective nullification of congressional will” in setting up the nation’s refugee admissions program. “The president has substantial discretion ... to suspend refugee admissions,” Whitehead told the parties. “But that authority is not limitless.”

A US judge extended an order blocking the Trump administration from instituting a sweeping freeze on trillions of dollars in federal funding by pausing grants, loans and other financial support. US district judge Loren AliKhan in Washington wrote that while some funds had become unfrozen since she first temporarily blocked the administration’s spending pause, there remained a risk the administration might again try to shut off funding. The judge said for those reasons she agreed with groups representing nonprofits and small business that a preliminary injunction was necessary blocking a further funding freeze.

A federal judge in Washington has ordered the Trump administration to pay foreign aid funds to contractors and grant recipients by 11.59pm on Wednesday night, saying there was no sign that it had taken any steps to comply with his earlier order that the funds be unfrozen.

The Senate confirmed Daniel Driscoll, an Iraq war veteran and adviser to JD Vance, as secretary of the army.

The tax cut proposals in this GOP budget blueprint passed on Tuesday center on $4.5tn in tax breaks, which would extend the tax cuts Trump implemented during his first term.

These tax cuts are currently set to expire later this year and the proposed package aims to prolong them. But the details of how these tax breaks would be structured haven’t been specified yet.

Trump’s tax cuts helped billionaires massively during his first term, with the richest families in the US paying a lower tax rate than the working class for the first time in history in 2018.

Several lawmakers are concerned that the proposed cuts – especially the $880bn over the next decade assigned to the committee overseeing healthcare spending, including Medicaid, and the $230bn allocated to the agriculture committee responsible for food stamps – could hinder their constituents back home.

“The House Republican budget will make people sicker and poorer,” said Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committee. “It will force even more families to live paycheck to paycheck while giving the wealthiest Americans a windfall big enough to buy a new private jet.”

Next steps involve weeks of committee hearings to draft the full legislative text, as well as negotiations with the Senate, where Republicans have their own scaled-back version.

Undocumented immigrants in the US who fail to register with the federal government could face fines, imprisonment, or both, according to a directive issued Tuesday by the Department of Homeland Security.

“The Trump administration will enforce all our immigration laws – we will not pick and choose which laws we will enforce,” a DHS spokesperson said. “We must know who is in our country for the safety and security of our homeland and all Americans.”

According to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services website, all immigrants over the age of 14 who were not fingerprinted or registered when applying for a US visa and who remain in the country for 30 days or longer must register and be fingerprinted.

Once registered and fingerprinted, DHS will provide evidence of registration, which immigrants over the age of 18 are required to carry at all times.

Last month, upon returning to office, Donald Trump declared illegal immigration at the US-Mexico border a national emergency and directed DHS to ensure that immigrants register with the federal government.

The administration is also working to end the Biden-era CBP One entry program, which allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants to legally enter the US by scheduling appointments through an app.

Trump-forward budget proposal imperiling Medicaid narrowly passes in Republican-led House

The House narrowly passed the budget resolution by a 217-215 vote after an intense push by Mike Johnson, the speaker, and Donald Trump.

The budget plan includes an estimated $800bn in potential cuts from Medicaid, a federal program providing healthcare coverage to more than 72 million Americans. The resolution also includes a $4.5tn in tax cuts and increased funding for defense and border security, offset by $2tn in spending reductions over the next decade.

The budget measure needed to pass by the 14 March deadline or risk a government shutdown.

The Social Security Administration said on Tuesday that it dissolved its office of civil rights and equal opportunity, and its employees will be put on administrative leave as of today.

Lee Dudek, Social Security’s acting commissioner, said in a statement that terminating the civil rights office “advances the President’s goal to make all of government more efficient in serving the American public”.

The agency’s office of civil rights and equal opportunity is responsible for planning and implementing programs designed to ensure equal opportunity in employment for all employees regardless of race, color, national origin, etc., according to its webpage.

SSA says it will transfer responsibility for processing civil rights complaints and reasonable accommodation requests to other agency offices “to ensure compliance with existing legal authorities”.

Nearly 6,000 veterans have been fired across the federal government since the start of Trump’s term, according to a new analysis by House Democrats.

Lauren Gambino

The report, compiled from data provided by the office of personnel management, estimates that roughly 38,000 federal workers have been fired since Trump took office last month and empowered Elon Musk’s ‘efficiency’ agency to dramatically reduce the federal workforce.

“Our veterans make significant sacrifices in service of our country, but those sacrifices do not seem to matter to President Trump and unchecked billionaire Elon Musk,” Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, ranking member of the House appropriations committee, said in a statement. “They are an essential part of our federal workforce, bringing their expertise to every single agency. Republicans are turning their back on them, allowing Musk to fire at least 6,000 veterans and leave them with no way to feed their families or keep a roof over their heads.”

Republicans have countered that the cuts are a necessary part of a long-overdue effort to root out government waste and inefficiency.

The federal government is the largest US employer of veterans, who comprise about 30% of the workforce.

Trump says Zelenskyy set to visit White House on Friday to sign minerals deal

Andrew Roth

Donald Trump has said that Volodymyr Zelenskyy is likely to visit the White House on Friday to sign a rare earth minerals deal to pay for US military aid to defend against Russia’s full-scale invasion.

The announcement followed days of tense negotiations between the US and Ukraine in which Zelenskyy alleged the US was pressuring him to sign a deal worth more than $500bn that would force “ten generations” of Ukrainians to pay it back.

Media outlets reported late on Tuesday that the terms of an agreement had been reached.

“I hear that he’s coming on Friday,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “Certainly it’s OK with me if he’d like to.”

According to the Financial Times, which first reported the deal, the new terms of the deal did not reportedly include the onerous demands for a right to $500bn in potential revenue from exploiting the resources, which include rare earth metals and Ukrainian oil and gas resources.

A framework for the deal included joint ownership of a fund to develop Ukraine’s mineral resources with certain caveats for those resources already contributing to the state budget.

Michael Sainato

The Guardian’s labor reporter, Michael Sainato, spoke to USAid workers who are expected to be ‘escorted’ back to the office to collect their belongings amid Trump’s bid to shut down the foreign aid agency.

Staff who spoke to the Guardian sounded the alarm over the impact of these moves on global security, warning that closing USAid and withdrawing foreign aid is “only leaving war on the table”.

The agency is “the canary in the coal mine” as Trump seeks to test the limits of his executive powers, said one USAid official, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation and harassment. “We see us as the most acute and boldest example of overreach, that checks and balances ought to restrain the powers of the president and the president should abide by the powers of Congress and the courts.

“Can the president act like a king? We’re a glaring flare for all of those things.”

The agency has been subjected to attacks and conspiracy theories about its work, with Elon Musk and his supporters making false claims about funding, including a baseless claim about the agency sending $50m to Gaza for condoms, and false claims about grants such as the suggestion by the so-called “department of government efficiency” that $21m had been sent to India to influence elections.

Musk has called the agency “a criminal organization” and argued that it was “time for it to die”. Pushed on his false condoms claim earlier this month, he responded: “Some of the things I say will be incorrect.”

Health clinics reliant on USAid grants in Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, Iraq and other countries around the world have been forced to shut down and international aid groups have already cut thousands of jobs due to the funding freeze.

The Trump administration is fighting challenges in court to freeze all USAid funding, place nearly all employees on leave.

“USAid was established by act of Congress. It needs to be un-established by act of Congress. They are ignoring that rule,” the USAid official said. “I would guess around 500 workers, no one has provided specifics, senior leaders, HR and IT people, are left behind to participate in the dismantling of the agency.”

Contracts and grants are still being cut and terminated, with only a small fraction of the agency’s work abroad still continuing, they said. “We’re a lifesaving agency. They certainly have done damage that will take years to undo, but even though they’ve closed the building and banned us from it, we’re not done. We still exist,” they said.

Americans are getting more concerned about a potential economic downturn caused by the policies of Donald Trump’s administration.

US consumer confidence plummeted in February, the biggest monthly decline in nearly four years, the Conference Board, a business research group, said on Tuesday. Inflation and a significant increase in mentions of trade and tariffs were the top concerns for respondents to the board’s survey.

The group’s consumer confidence index plummeted this month to 98.3 from 105.3 in January. That’s far below the expectations of economists, who projected a reading of 103, according to a survey by FactSet.

The proportion of consumers expecting a recession over the next year jumped to a nine-month high, the board said.

Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of US economic activity and is closely watched by economists for signs about how the American consumer is feeling.

Trump’s Iron Dome for America system is now reportedly called Golden Dome

Donald Trump’s Iron Dome for America initiative for a missile defense system protecting US skies from attack has been reportedly renamed the Golden Dome for America.

In a video published on Thursday, secretary of defense Pete Hegseth referred to the project as “the Golden Dome or Iron Dome”. A defense official confirmed shortly after that the name of the initiative has been officially changed to “Golden Dome”, according to military news website Defense One.

A spokesperson for Space Force did not respond to a Guardian query on the possible name change.

The idea of a new name comes as a team of technical experts has been assembled by the US Space Force to determine which programs can help build out the initiative.

The Iron – or perhaps now Golden – Dome for America executive order, signed by Trump on 27 January, is a directive for Hegseth to submit a comprehensive plan that details an implementation strategy, including the required architecture, for a missile defense system.

Trump is known for his grand renaming of things, including the Gulf of Mexico, which is now known officially in the US as the Gulf of America, as well as having a gaudy taste for golden and luxurious decorations, such as that which often adorn his apartments and buildings like Trump Tower in New York.

The defense system focuses heavily on the concept of space-based sensors and interceptors. The company that currently dominates the market for such equipment is the Elon Musk-owned SpaceX, leading to concerns that this project is another way for Musk to make money from federal programs.

John Thune, the Senate majority leader, is defending the Trump administration’s cuts to federal workers and programs, calling them a long overdue “scrub” of the federal government.

Still, the Republican from South Dakota acknowledged that the reductions are affecting the home states of GOP senators.

“I think we all understand that this government, the federal government, is long in need of the kind of scrub that is being done to figure out how we can do things better,” Thune said at the Capitol.

He said that senators would make the Trump administration aware if programs, such as those that impact health and safety, are at risk.

The Trump administration plans to cut employees at the US Department of Housing and Urban Development who assist officials and citizens in navigating government housing programs, the AP reports.

These cuts are among the first steps in the administration’s broader plan to reduce HUD’s workforce by half.

The field policy and management division is expected to lose at least 145 employees – about 40% of its staff – by 18 May.

A memo from the HUD secretary Scott Turner, dated Monday, states that all positions within the office at a certain pay grade and below “are being abolished”.

Trump reinstates rule on healthcare cost transparency

Trump reinstated a rule requiring cost transparency in healthcare.

The rule requires hospitals to publish online the prices for some of their most common services, including MRI scans and caesarean section deliveries. The lack of transparency has often left patients shocked by medical bills.

Trump previously issued a similar order during the final year of his first term.

Hospitals and insurers had strongly opposed the rule, with many failing to comply.

“It’s been unpopular in some circles because people make less money,” Trump said. “But it’s great for the patient. It’s great for the people in our country.”

Fox News senior White House correspondent, Jacqui Heinrich, condemned the Trump administration’s decision to determine which outlets have access to the president as part of the press pool, a selection that the White House Correspondents’ Association makes.

“This move does not give the power back to the people – it gives power to the White House,” Heinrich posted on X. “The WHCA is democratically elected by the full-time White House press corps.”

“WHCA has determined pools for decades because only representatives FROM our outlets can determine resources all those outlets have – such as staffing – in order to get the President’s message out to the largest possible audience, no matter the day or hour,” she added.

USAid staffers have only 15 minutes to retrieve belongings from their former offices, according to The Associated Press.

For nearly three weeks, many staffers at the agency’s main building in Washington have been barred from entering as the administration continues dismantling the facility.

Several employees have requested permission to retrieve personal items, including family photos and work shoes stored in drawers.

The notice about the arrangements says that aid workers must undergo security screening before reentering.

The Guardian’s labor reporter Michael Sainato reports that, in the notice, staffers were told to “bring their own boxes, bags, tape, and/or other containers to remove their personal items; these items will not be provided”.

“Neither USAID, nor any of our assisting agencies, will provide boxes, tape, protective wrapping, or other packaging materials to assist with the retrieval process,” the notice reads.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order suspending security clearances for lawyers at the Covington & Burling law firm that worked with special counsel Jack Smith.

Smith led the federal cases against Trump on charges of trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat and mishandling of classified documents.

The order comes less than a month after the US justice department fired more than a dozen prosecutors who worked on the criminal cases against Trump in a move to purge people who worked for Smith.

Edward Wong of the New York Times reports that Trump appointees at USAid have sent recently-fired employees a list of more than 100 weapons they are prohibited from bringing when returning to the office to collect their belongings.

Firearms, axes, martial arts weapons, including nunchucks and throwing stars, were in the list, as well as spearguns and dynamite.

Staff will collect their personal belongings at the Ronald Reagan Building this Thursday and Friday

There have been no known recent incidents of aid agency employees making weapon-related threats, Wong reports.

"The $20 Billion Controversy Over E.P.A. Climate Funds, Explained",https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-02-25-0546/environment-20-billion-controversy-over-epa-climate-funds-explained,New York Times (News),https://www.allsides.com/news-source/new-york-times,Lean Left,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/climate/epa-climate-funds-green-banks-20-billion.html,"The fate of $20 billion in federal climate funding that was legally committed months before the election has been thrown into question after a weeklong controversy involving “gold bars,” the right-wing group Project Veritas and two federal agencies.

Now, more than 200 planned investments intended to help finance clean energy and environmental projects in underserved communities may be at risk.

Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a press release announcing it had found billions of dollars, or what it called “gold bars,” that had been “parked” at a financial institution during the Biden administration.

In a video accompanying the release, Lee Zeldin, the leader of the E.P.A., criticized the Biden administration’s decision to use a private bank to disburse the funds and called for Citibank, the bank in question, to return the money.

The money was “green bank” funding from the E.P.A.’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which received $27 billion under the Biden-era 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

Funds were held in Citibank accounts under the names of eight nonprofit grantees, which were planning to send it to other green banks and loan it out for climate projects.

Dept. of Justice resignation

The situation escalated on Tuesday, when Denise Cheung, a top federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C., abruptly resigned after she refused to open a criminal investigation into an unnamed government vendor and freeze unspent assets. The vendor is believed to be Citibank, and the assets in question are thought to be the $20 billion identified by Zeldin’s team.

Cheung said in a resignation letter that she felt there was not sufficient evidence to restrict the nonprofits’ access to the accounts.

By Thursday, it wasn’t clear whether Citibank would freeze the funds. That has created confusion among grant recipients about whether they’ll have access to the money.

The Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the E.P.A. referred to a post on Zeldin’s X account. Citibank declined to comment.

What about those ‘gold bars’?

“My awesome team at E.P.A. has found the gold bars,” Zeldin said in the video last week. “This scheme was the first of its kind in E.P.A. history, and it was purposely designed to obligate all of the money in a rush job with reduced oversight.”

The “gold bars” were a reference to a hidden-camera video released by Project Veritas in December. The video appeared to show a person who was then an E.P.A. adviser comparing the outgoing administration’s efforts to spend federal climate money before it left office to throwing “gold bars” off the Titanic.

Though Zeldin characterized the process as a “rush job,” plans to award $20 billion to the eight nonprofits were announced in April. The money was legally committed ahead of a September deadline.

The role of private banks

Thus far, there has been no evidence of illegal activity related to the $20 billion in funds. And the federal government has long made agreements with private banks, including Citibank, to handle financial transactions like the payment of government benefits with debit cards. A 2016 Government Accountability Office report found that one Treasury Department bureau was using 20 financial agents at the time.

Adam Kent, director of blended and inclusive finance at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said a financial agent had been chosen for the E.P.A. grants to make it easier for green banks to raise additional money from private markets. (Green banks typically use a mix of public and private money to fund decarbonization efforts.)

Last year the Biden administration estimated the funds would attract $7 in private capital for every government dollar spent.

Grants and subgrants

In an interview with Fox News last week, Zeldin described the eight nonprofit grantees with Citibank accounts as “pass-throughs, giving money to subgrantees.”

This is by design, said Katherine Mogg, who was formerly in charge of legal and regulatory affairs at NY Green Bank. (As of 2021, there were 21 green banks across the country.)

Mogg said that long before the Inflation Reduction Act was passed, green energy proponents debated how federal funding could best be spread out to projects all around the country.

These top-level nonprofits would send funding to smaller entities, like state green banks, and the sub-grantees would then lend money to individual projects, Mogg said. As loan recipients repaid their debt, green banks could use the money to fund more new projects.

What’s next?

Any attempt to freeze or claw back the green bank grants is likely to result in legal challenges.

Even a relatively short delay could affect long-term plans for businesses counting on the program. In the coming months, more than $1 billion in investments is scheduled to close, including funds for affordable home construction projects and solar farms in Native American and rural communities.

New data from a NASA plane shows the widening threat of these slow-moving landslides, which have destabilized homes, businesses, and infrastructure like roads and utilities. Researchers have documented how the landslides have pushed westward, almost doubling in area since the state mapped them in 2007.

The landslides have also sped up in recent years. A month of aerial radar images taken by NASA in the fall revealed how land in the Palos Verdes Peninsula slid toward the ocean by as much as four inches each week between mid-September and mid-October. — Austyn Gaffney and Harry Stevens

U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee, declined to immediately grant the AP's request for a temporary injunction restoring its access to the Oval Office and Air Force One during a hearing in Washington federal court.

The AP sued three senior Trump aides on Friday, arguing that the decision to block its reporters from those locations violates the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protections against government abridgment of speech by trying to dictate the language they use in reporting the news.

Lawyers for the Trump administration argued in a court filing before the hearing that the AP does not have a constitutional right to what it called ""special media access to the president.""

White House Communications Director Steven Cheung in a earlier statement had called the AP lawsuit a ""blatant PR stunt."" During an appearance last week at the Conservative Political Action Conference, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also said, ""We feel we are in the right in this position.""

Leavitt is one of the three White House officials named as defendants in the lawsuit. The other two, Chief of Staff Susan Wiles and Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich, have not responded to requests for comment.

Trump signed an executive order last month directing the U.S. Interior Department to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.

The AP said in January it would continue to use the gulf's long-established name in stories while also acknowledging Trump's efforts to change it.

The White House banned AP reporters in response. The ban prevents the AP's journalists from seeing and hearing Trump and other top White House officials as they take newsworthy actions or respond in real time to news events.

The White House Correspondents' Association said in a legal brief backing the AP in the case that the ban ""will chill and distort news coverage of the president to the public's detriment."" Reuters released a statement in support of the AP.",Center,True

Ramaswamy continued to add that under his leadership Ohio would be the top state in the U.S. where “capitalism and meritocracy” is embraced, “instead of apologizing for it.”

“We will lead Ohio to be the top state in the country that takes a hatchet to red tape, over regulation, and bureaucracy,” Ramaswamy added. “We will lead Ohio to be the top state in the country where we lead the way in the sectors of the future, from semiconductors to aerospace. I will lead Ohio to be the top state in the country where patriots across America actually flock to, instead of Florida and Texas. I will lead Ohio to be the state of excellence in America.”

Ramaswamy’s announcement that he is running to serve as the next governor of Ohio comes after a report that he had filed paperwork in Ohio’s 2026 gubernatorial race.

Breitbart News’s Alana Mastrangelo previously reported that on Tuesday, February 25, “Ramaswamy will be at Glass City Center in Toledo and The Local Bar in the Cleveland suburb of Strongsville.” Additionally, Ramaswamy will be the keynote speaker at the 2025 Lincoln Day Dinner hosted by the Lucas County Republican Party, according to Facebook.",Right,False

Stephen A.

Smith challenged Whoopi Goldberg during “The View” on Tuesday over the Democratic Party’s messaging problem after the liberal host attempted to defend the messaging by comparing it to President Donald Trump.

“If you think about him being impeached twice, 34 felony convictions, and they still elected him president, it’s not about him winning. It was an indictment against the Democratic Party and what the Democratic Party was offering to American citizens. We might sit up there and talk about, ‘Hey, you should be a party for the working class,’ which the Democrats was once known for. They’re not known for that right now. Why? Because their message was catering towards others and other issues, and they forgot about the people that brought them there, that elevated the Democratic Party to what it was over the last few decades. That’s why they lost. He didn’t win. The Democrats lost,” he told the co-hosts of “The View.”

Smith, a Trump critic, has regularly criticized the Democratic Party and their messaging ahead of the election as well as after Trump won.

Co-host Whoopi Goldberg attempted to push back on Smith and said she wanted to remind people of what those issues were, arguing they included, “Making sure that families had what they need. SNAP, making sure stuff is there. Making sure that the America that we all grew up in where you could come and be whoever you were supposed to be or want to be, you still have that right. All these things are the things that the Democrats have always said.”

She then compared that to President Donald Trump’s early executive actions, specifically in cutting federal jobs, as Smith pushed back.

“Before you brought that up, you brought up the message that the Democratic Party was disseminating. I’m challenging you on that. That is not what they were doing,” he said.

Goldberg shot back, “Oh, yes, it was. I was here. We did it.”

Smith went on to argue that Biden contributed to a major migrant crisis and wondered why, pointing out that former President Barack Obama deported more migrants than Trump.

“The bottom line, you’re Joe Biden, you open borders. Now, remember, Barack Obama deported more people than Trump did. You know what he didn’t do, he didn’t stick out his chest and bloviate about it, he just did it. What does Joe Biden do? Who is the Democrat, who is the vice president under Barack Obama? He opens borders. Over 12-plus million people entered the country. You had stuff going on in the streets, there was a migrant crisis,” Smith said.

In the second segment, Smith made the argument that Trump did have a mandate from the American people, pointing to his gains within minority groups.

“If you’re the Democratic Party and you lost 49.8% to 48.3%, and looking at that 1.5% difference, that’s an excuse to say, what we did really wasn’t that bad, we should continue to do that. No, don’t continue to do it, find a new strategy,” he said.

Smith demanded to know what Democrats were doing to win future elections, and said he would continue to interview prominent Democratic figures and ask them that question.

“I want somebody to step up and recognize that man in the Oval Office, whether you like it or not, is potent, he’s coming, and he wins, you got to find a way to beat him,” he said.",Lean Right,True

BBC News, Washington

President Donald Trump declared ""the American Dream is unstoppable"" as he addressed a raucous joint session of the US Congress for the first time since he returned to power.

In the longest presidential speech to lawmakers on record, he outlined his vision for his second term, as Republicans applauded a high-octane six weeks that has reshaped domestic and foreign policy.

Trump was heckled by Democrats and he goaded them in turn during the rowdy primetime address.

The Republican president has moved to slash the federal workforce and crack down on immigration, while imposing tariffs on America's biggest trading partners and shaking up the transatlantic alliance over the war in Ukraine.

Here are six of the key takeaways.

Trump predicts a bumpy ride ahead on tariffs

Following a second day of market turbulence, Trump played down the potential economic fallout from a trade war he ignited this week, including 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% on Chinese imports.

But in contrast with the ovations that greeted his other policy objectives, many Republicans remained seated, a sign of how Trump's import taxes have divided his party.

""Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again,"" he said.

""And it's happening. And it will happen rather quickly. There'll be a little disturbance, but we're okay with that. It won't be much.""

Trump added that reciprocal tariffs tailored to US trading partners would ""kick in"" on 2 April.

Earlier in the day, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox Business that Trump could announce a trade deal with Mexico and Canada as soon as Wednesday.

Trump will 'probably' cut tariffs, says commerce chief

What are tariffs, and why is Trump using them?

A minerals deal with Ukraine looks back on

Trump said he had received an ""important letter"" from Ukraine's leader earlier in the day, which appeared to match what Volodymyr Zelensky posted publicly on social media.

Ukraine's president had said he was now ready to work under Trump's ""strong leadership"" to end the war and ""come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer"".

""I appreciate that he sent this letter,"" Trump told lawmakers.

Zelensky offered the olive branch a day after Trump paused all military aid to the beleaguered US ally.

It followed an acrimonious Oval Office meeting last week when the two leaders argued in front of TV cameras, before cancelling plans to sign a minerals deal that would allow the US to profit from an economic partnership involving Ukraine's resources.

Trump was reportedly hoping to announce during his speech to Congress that the deal had finally been sealed. But it did not materialise.

Trump and Zelensky's fraying relationship, in their own words

Greenland is in his sights, Lesotho isn't

Despite most of his 99-minute speech focusing on domestic issues, Trump's worldview also came more sharply into focus.

There are places in the world he wants to expand US influence and others where he wants to withdraw.

Repeating his desire for the US to acquire Greenland, he vowed ""we're going to get it - one way or the other"". And he said his administration would ""reclaim"" the Panama Canal.

There were several mentions of African countries when he rattled through a list of what he described as wasteful spending under his predecessor, Joe Biden.

Liberia, Mali, Mozambique and Uganda were all places unfairly benefiting from US aid, he said.

But his most pointed remark was about Lesotho, which he said was a country ""nobody has ever heard of"" despite receiving $8m (£6.2m) to promote LGBT rights.

Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

He stood by Musk despite protests over cuts

Early on Trump name-checked his billionaire adviser Elon Musk, who was watching from the gallery.

The tech mogul's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) taskforce has moved to fire tens of thousands of federal workers, cut billions of dollars in foreign aid and slash programmes across the US government.

The SpaceX and Tesla boss, wearing a dark suit with a blue tie, stood and acknowledged the cheers from the crowd.

""Thank you, Elon,"" the 78-year-old president said. ""He's working very hard. He didn't need this.""

Musk's cuts have sparked some angry scenes at town hall meetings and his instructions to federal employees have at times been overruled by members of Trump's cabinet.

In the chamber, Democratic lawmakers held up signs saying ""Musk steals"" and ""false"".

Doge claims to have saved $105bn already but that figure can't be independently verified. Receipts have been published for $18.6bn worth of savings but accounting errors have been reported by US media outlets that have analysed the figures.

Young Republicans cheer Trump on from Texas watch party

Democratic pushback was loud and it was pink

Within the first five minutes of the address, Al Green of Texas was escorted out of the chamber by the sergeant-at-arms after refusing to comply with the House Speaker's demands that he stop heckling the president and take his seat.

As Trump spoke, other Democrats held up signs saying ""This is a lie"".

With Republicans in control of the White House, House of Representatives and Senate, Democrats have been largely leaderless as they work to hone their message and counter the blitz of activity from the Trump administration.

Many Democratic women arrived in the House chamber wearing pink pantsuits in protest. Dozens from their party – some of them wearing the words ""Resist"" printed on the backs of their shirts - exited the chamber during the speech.

""There is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy,"" Trump said, appearing to revel in the partisan rancour.

Democratic leadership chose Elissa Slotkin of Michigan - a first-term senator elected in a battleground state that Trump won in November - to deliver the party's official response.

She accused Trump of an ""unprecedented giveaway to his billionaire friends"" and warned ""he could walk us right into a recession"".

He's betting on energy to bring down inflation

Trump pledged to voters that he would beat inflation on his return to office and he used the speech to say his focus would be to reduce the cost of energy, by opening up the country to new oil and gas drilling.

""We have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on earth, and by far, and now I fully authorize the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it. It's called drill, baby, drill.""

The soaring cost of eggs has been headline news in recent weeks, and Trump made clear who he felt was responsible.

""Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control - and we are working hard to get it back down,"" he added.

Egg prices rose as the Biden administration directed millions of egg-laying birds to be culled last year amid a bird flu outbreak, though prices have continued rising in Trump's fledgling presidency.

Inflation was slightly elevated at 3% last month, but way down from its peak of 9.1% in 2022.

Only one in three Americans approve of Trump's handling of cost of living, according to a Reuters/Ipsos survey on Tuesday.

Four months of student-led demonstrations , sparked by the deaths of 15 people when a railway station roof collapsed , have drawn in teachers, farmers and others to become the biggest threat yet to President Aleksandar Vucic's decade-long rule, with many denouncing rampant corruption and incompetence in government. At the legislative session, after the ruling coalition led by the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) approved the agenda, some opposition politicians ran from their seats towards the parliamentary speaker and scuffled with security guards. Others tossed smoke grenades and used pepper spray. A live TV broadcast showed black and pink smoke billowing inside the parliament, which has seen brawls before, in the decades since the introduction of multi-party democracy in 1990. Vucic later said authorities would hold all those deputies involved in the fracas to account, calling it ""hooliganism"". Under Serbian law, parliamentary deputies enjoy immunity from prosecution but can lose it if they commit serious crimes. POLITICIAN HURT Speaker Ana Brnabic said three lawmakers were injured and one, Jasmina Obradovic of the SNS party, had suffered a stroke and was hospitalised.

Opposition deputies also held signs reading ""general strike"" and ""justice for those killed"", referring to those who died when the station roof collapsed in the city of Novi Sad last November. Outside parliament hundreds of protesters stood in silence to honour those killed. Protest leaders called for a major rally in the capital Belgrade on March 15. The ruling coalition says Western intelligence agencies are trying to destabilise Serbia and topple the government by backing the protests. ""We have a proposal ... to have a transitional government,"" Radomir Lazovic of the opposition Green-Left Front told supporters in front of the parliament. The opposition says a transitional government should secure conditions for free and fair elections, but Vucic and his allies have so far rejected that demand. ""This was a failed attempt of the ruling coalition to show it is in control ..., and (there's) a potential for an escalation,"" Radivoje Grujic, a Warsaw-based consultant told Reuters, commenting on the parliamentary session. Parliament was due to adopt a law increasing funds for universities - one of the main demands of protesting students.

"U.S. designates Houthis a terrorist organization, reversing Biden move",https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-03-05-0154/middle-east-us-designates-houthis-terrorist-organization-reversing-biden-move,Washington Post,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/washington-post-media-bias,Lean Left,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/03/04/houthi-trump-rubio-foreign-terrorist-designation/,"The Trump administration on Tuesday re-designated the Houthi militant group in Yemen as a foreign terrorist organization, reversing a decision made by President Joe Biden in 2021, after more than a year of attacks on U.S. Navy and commercial vessels at sea.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement that he was fulfilling one of President Donald Trump’s campaign promises after hundreds of Houthi attacks on vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The Houthis have described their campaign of violence as an act of solidarity with Hamas, the militant group whose attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, triggered a war in Gaza that has upended security across the region.

“Today’s action taken by the State Department demonstrates the Trump Administration’s commitment to protecting our national security interests, the safety of the American people, and the security of the United States,” Rubio said. “Terrorist designations play a critical role in our fight against terrorism and are an effective way to curtail support for terrorist activities.”

Rubio also warned China and other countries that may seek to maintain ties with the Houthis, noting that a recent attack “spared Chinese-flagged ships while targeting American and allied vessels.” The United States, Rubio declared, “will not tolerate any country engaging with terrorist organizations like the Houthis in the name of practicing legitimate international business.”

The group, formally known as Ansar Allah, was already the subject of earlier U.S. sanctions and other punitive measures, but the foreign terrorist designation makes it a crime for people or entities such as banks to offer “material support or resources” to the Houthis and bars its members from the United States.

On Tuesday, the Justice Department said it is offering up to $15 million for information leading to the disruption of the Houthis’ finances.

The Houthis, a rebel group that seized the Yemeni capital of Sanaa in 2014, function as the de facto government across a wide swath of Yemen, including in many of its most populous areas. Relying heavily on weapons provided by Iran, the Houthis have aligned themselves with other regional militant groups and positioned themselves as a leader of the armed opposition to Israel and the United States.

Shortly before departing office in January 2021, the first Trump administration designated the Houthis a foreign terrorist organization, citing cross-border violence into Saudi Arabia and an attack on an airport in Aden, a southern Yemeni city. The Biden administration undid that designation the following month, citing the limitations it placed on delivering humanitarian aid to Yemen, where a decade of civil conflict has fueled severe poverty and malnutrition.

In the aftermath of the Hamas attack in October 2023, Houthi leaders said they would attack ships associated with Israel. The campaign that followed was often indiscriminate, however, with vessels from a variety of countries targeted and at least a couple that were sunk.

The Biden administration responded by recruiting partners and allies to join a multinational naval task force to protect shipping and eventually launching airstrikes at the Houthis. Biden administration officials also sought to curtail weapons smuggling from Iran to Yemen, but officials familiar with the issue said that effort was difficult.

The U.S. military increased its tempo of strikes on Houthi targets in the final weeks of the Biden administration in response to what former U.S. officials said was an increasingly aggressive campaign to strike both Israeli and U.S. assets in the region.

On Tuesday, Houthi authorities announced they had shot down an American MQ-9 Reaper drone over Yemeni airspace in Hodeida governate, in what they said was the 15th downing of enemy aircraft since Hamas’s October 2023 attack.

A U.S. defense official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said the U.S. military had lost contact with an MQ-9 over the Red Sea on Monday. “We are actively assessing the incident to determine the cause and follow-on actions,” the official said.

Former officials said the Biden administration developed a proposal that would have re-designated the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization late last year, but officials ultimately decided to leave that decision to the incoming Trump administration.

U.S. officials have said that while Iran has provided significant support to the Houthis, they see the group as an independent actor that might not necessarily respond to Tehran’s instructions to stand down its maritime attacks. The Houthis have also established their own substantial, independent weapons production capability.

Mohammed Al-Basha, a Yemen analyst, said the designation may result in additional U.S. steps to isolate the Houthis financially and logistically, such as cutting off the access of Yemeni banks from the global banking system. But he also noted that the group could attempt to evade the measures by working with Russia or other actors to obtain fuel or other imports.

The Houthis have largely halted their attacks on commercial and naval vessels following Israel’s ceasefire with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Al-Basha said, but Houthi officials have warned they will resume drone and missile strikes should the deal break down.

Aid groups have warned about the humanitarian impact of a re-designation. In a January statement following the Trump administration’s announcement that it intended to target the Houthis, Oxfam America said that Trump’s previous designation had damaging impacts on imports and commerce even before it took effect.

“We know that humanitarian exemptions weren’t enough to stop the immediate impacts,” Scott Paul, the group’s peace and security director, said in January. “Even with those caveats, exporters canceled contracts, banks prepared to scale back, and humanitarian organizations began to plan for a dramatic escalation with even fewer resources and more constraints.”",Center,False
Linda McMahon gives Education staffers their ‘final mission’,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-03-04-1313/education-linda-mcmahon-gives-education-staffers-their-final-mission,The Hill,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/hill-media-bias,Center,https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5175086-linda-mcmahon-education-department-trump-musk/,"Linda McMahon, the new secretary of Education, sent out the agency’s “final mission” message to staffers after her confirmation vote on Monday, previewing President Trump’s plans to roll up the department.

In her message, McMahon said she is ready to take on one of Trump’s “most momentous campaign promises to families” and “send education back to the states.”

Trump has repeatedly expressed desire to eliminate the federal Education Department, saying before McMahon’s party-line Senate confirmation that he had told her to put herself “out of a job.”

The message focused on the department’s “new era of accountability” and how the upcoming months of cutting bureaucracy from the agency will lead to big changes.

“This restoration will profoundly impact staff, budgets, and agency operations here at the Department. In coming months, we will partner with Congress and other federal agencies to determine the best path forward to fulfill the expectations of the President and the American people. We will eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy so that our colleges, K-12 schools, students, and teachers can innovate and thrive,” McMahon said.

She laid out the three convictions staffers will need to have: parents should choose their children’s education; taxpayer-funded schools are for math and reading, “not divisive DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] programs and gender ideology;” and postsecondary education should be for creating well-paying jobs useful to the workforce.

“Removing red tape and bureaucratic barriers will empower parents to make the best educational choices for their children. An effective transfer of educational oversight to the states will mean more autonomy for local communities. Teachers, too, will benefit from less micromanagement in the classroom — enabling them to get back to basics,” McMahon said.

The new Education secretary also mentioned Trump’s executive orders promoting school choice and ridding schools of critical race theory and DEI programs.

The message comes after dozens of staffers have already been put on administrative leave and millions of dollars in federal education contracts have been canceled as Trump and Elon Musk move to dramatically reshape and reduce the federal government.

While the future is uncertain for Education Department employees, McMahon said, “every staff member of this Department should be enthusiastic about any change that will benefit students.”",Center,True

The speech comes after a blitz of executive actions seeking to purge a federal bureaucracy he views as disloyal and otherwise reshape domestic and foreign policy. In pursuing his agenda, Mr. Trump has repeatedly made false statements and claims lacking evidence, including that Ukraine started the war with Russia and that diversity programs at the Federal Aviation Administration led to a plane crash this year.

The president’s address is expected to touch on the major cuts that he and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency have ordered for federal programs and the government’s work force. He is also expected to trumpet his immigration crackdown and his moves to impose steep tariffs in an effort to bolster domestic manufacturing.

Mr. Trump’s remarks on these issues over the past few weeks offer a preview of possible talking points. Here’s a fact-check:

What Was Said

“We were richest — the richest, relatively — from, think of this, from 1870 to 1913. That was our richest because we collected tariffs from foreign countries that came in and took our jobs and took our money, took our everything, but they charged tariffs.”

— at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 22

False. Mr. Trump is wrong that the United States was richest during the Gilded Age, and he is overstating the impact of tariffs. He is also wrong that the country grew less prosperous in 1913, when a permanent federal income tax was introduced.

A White House spokeswoman noted that wages and the economy grew rapidly during the Gilded Age, but did not provide evidence of unparalleled prosperity in that era. The United States is far richer now than it was during that time, even when accounting for inflation. From 1870 to 1913, the country’s gross domestic product grew to nearly $1 trillion from about $190 billion, and to $10,000 from $4,800 per capita. Those figures have continued to rise precipitously, reaching nearly $20 trillion and more than $58,000 per capita in 2022.

Relative to other countries, the United States was just as rich or richer in the post-World War II era than in the Gilded Age. The United States was the third-largest economy in 1870, after China and India, but had become the world’s largest by 1920, making up about 23 percent of global G.D.P. It remained the world’s largest economy until 2014, when China took the lead.

Inequality, though, reached a peak during the Gilded Age. The United States had one of the highest rates of economic disparity in the world in 1910. Estimates of U.S. inequality, using a standard global metric, fell after the introduction of taxes aimed at wealthier people but rebounded somewhat in recent decades.

The U.S. economy did grow at a rapid clip in the Gilded Age, but tariffs were not the sole factor, said Richard White, a historian at Stanford University and an expert on the Gilded Age. He noted other reasons, including the U.S. seizure of Native land and the population’s doubling from 1860 to 1890, in large part because of immigration.

What Was Said

“We have found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud so far.”

— before a bilateral meeting with President Emmanuel Macron of France on Feb. 24

This lacks evidence. The White House spokeswoman said the Department of Government Efficiency had identified hundreds of billions of dollars in fraud in the federal government. But even the government overhaul team itself does not purport to have found that much in specific savings or fraud.

According to Mr. Musk’s team, it has generated $105 billion in savings, as of Sunday. The initiative’s website includes details for canceled contracts that it says total about $8 billion in savings and broad descriptions for around $10 billion in terminated grants and $660 million in terminated leases. That’s a total of less than $20 billion, with the rest appearing unexplained.

As The New York Times and other news outlets have documented, the roughly $20 billion in savings is also not verified. The initiative has updated its website periodically to address mistakes such as contracts erroneously listed as worth billions but actually worth millions, contracts that were counted multiple times and contracts that have long ended or were not actually canceled.

The federal Government Accountability Office estimated last year, before the creation of DOGE, that the government loses $233 billion to $521 billion a year to fraud. But it is unclear if any of the Trump administration cuts announced thus far were canceled payments for fraudulent services.

While Mr. Trump and other officials have cast spending with which they disagree as wasteful, fraud involves deception or misrepresentation. For example, DOGE has said that it has canceled leases at underused and vacant properties and that there is “plenty of available office space for the current workforce.” It did not mention fraud in those leases.

What Was Said

“Europe has given $100 billion. The United States has given $350 billion because we had a stupid, incompetent president and administration, 350. But here’s worse: Europe gave it in the form of a loan; they get their money back.”

— at CPAC on Feb. 22, in reference to aid to Ukraine

This is exaggerated. Mr. Trump is overstating the United States’ financial support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s invasion, understating Europe’s, and misrepresenting the proportion of loans and grants that each has given.

Official and independent estimates of American aid to Ukraine show it is about half of Mr. Trump’s figure. The Congressional Research Service reported that Congress has appropriated $174 billion in aid for Ukraine since the 2022 fiscal year. The Pentagon’s inspector general estimated that figure was about $182 billion.

The White House spokeswoman argued that there were tens of billions more in indirect costs, which she said included lost trade with Russia because of economic sanctions as well as the war’s inflationary impact. But lost trade and inflation also affected Europe, which was one of Russia’s biggest trading partners before the war. Mr. Trump, at other times, has conceded that the amount of aid the United States has provided to Ukraine might be less than $350 billion.

The European Union has estimated that its member states made available about $145 billion in aid, with tens of billions more committed.

Mr. Trump has a point that the bulk of American aid has been in grants and direct assistance rather than loans, but he is overstating the proportion of loans the European Union has provided.

The Pentagon’s inspector general noted that the United States provided about $20 billion, or roughly 10 percent of total aid, in loans. In comparison, the European Union says it has provided about 35 percent of total aid, roughly $50 billion, in loans.

Faced with an expansionist Russia and an unpredictable American president, European leaders are also looking to increase their own military spending and shoulder a heavier burden in Ukraine’s and the continent’s defense.

“For four long years, you had a president who put illegal aliens up in penthouse suites and beautiful hotels on Park Avenue or on Madison Avenue or on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.” — at CPAC on Feb. 22

“They sent $59 million to New York City for a hotel, for a little bit of nothing, what they’ve done. A hotel that was not luxury that’s getting luxury rates for migrants, where they’re making a fortune.” — at a swearing-in ceremony on Feb. 12

This is misleading. New York did house tens of thousands of migrants in hotels, but Mr. Trump is largely wrong about where the migrants were housed, the payments and the Biden administration’s role.

In 2023, Congress created the Shelter and Services Program, which in the 2024 fiscal year doled out about $640 million in grants to groups and localities that provide shelter and other services to migrants. The program does not directly pay for hotel rooms or decide where exactly migrants are housed.

New York City received around $190 million total in the 2023 and 2024 fiscal years, according to federal data.

But the city has spent far more than what it has received from the federal government to house migrants, as it sought to provide lodging beyond already-squeezed city shelters. According to a comptroller report, the city spent nearly $1 billion on housing migrants at 119 hotels from September 2022 to August 2024. Most were budget or midscale properties, receiving an average nightly rate of $156 in the 2024 fiscal year, compared with a cost of around $52 for a shelter bed. About 19 of the hotels were in Manhattan.",Left,False
DOGE Goes Deep State,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-03-04-1242/politics-doge-goes-deep-state,Reason,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reason,Center,https://reason.com/2025/03/04/doge-goes-deep-state/,"For much of the past decade, President Donald Trump and his allies have been waging a war against the so-called ""deep state""—and the conflict has only escalated since Trump's return to power.

There's no official definition of the term, of course. Loosely, the deep state is the collection of bureaucrats, contractors, intelligence officials, and other official or even quasi-official entities that more-or-less retain their power no matter who occupies the White House or which party controls Congress. But it's more specific than that. Implicit in talk about the deep state is the idea that certain individuals outside the official chain of command wield the true power in the federal government, and that they frequently ignore or thwart the will of the people's elected and appointed representatives. In a nutshell, the deep state is undemocratic and unaccountable, even to powerful figures in the federal government.

Trump has cast the deep state as one of the chief antagonists of his populist movement, in no small part because such movements always require enemies (and the less well-defined the better). Much of what the second Trump administration has done so far—from the mass firings of federal employees to the appointment of unorthodox leaders at the Pentagon, FBI, and other key outposts—is probably best understood as a direct assault upon this perceived opponent.

But at the same time that he's focused on dismantling the deep state, Trump seems to have built his own undemocratic, unaccountable executive apparatus.

How else should we view the incident that The Washington Post reported on last week involving Elon Musk, the unofficial head of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), and Secretary of State Marco Rubio?

As DOGE was slashing its way through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Rubio issued a waiver ensuring that ""existing life-saving humanitarian assistance programs"" should continue, despite the announced shutdown of USAID. ""Several times, USAID managers prepared packages of these payments and got the agency's interim leaders to sign off on them with support from the White House,"" the Post reported. ""But each time, using their new gatekeeping powers and clearly acting on orders from Musk or one of his lieutenants, [Luke] Farritor and [Gavin] Kliger would veto the payments—a process that required them to manually check boxes in the payment system one at a time, the same tedious way you probably pay your bills online.""

As a result, USAID clinics that were supposed to be protected by Rubio's order were shuttered.

That is an almost perfect illustration of how conservatives used to believe the deep state operated—with unelected, unofficial back-channel operatives overruling the plainly stated instructions of those who are nominally in power.

And, sure, much of USAID's spending seems to have been wasteful and in need of a thorough audit, if not a serious cut. Yes, you can also make whatever jokes you'd like about Rubio getting exactly what he deserves for becoming Trump's lackey.

Still, this should be worrying to anyone who takes seriously the threat of the deep state or values the rule of law.

Whatever your views of Musk and Rubio as individuals, it simply cannot be that the Senate-confirmed secretary of state is having his decisions overruled by a man (or his lieutenants) who still lacks any official place in the White House's organizational chart and who runs a rebranded version of the U.S. Digital Service, an agency meant to streamline the executive branch's digital outreach efforts that has no statutory authority to make spending decisions.

It's an encouraging sign that some Republicans are upset about this.

""Now that Marco is confirmed and in place, there should be nobody in the administration—outside of the president of the United States or at the direction of the president—that should pause, delay, or cancel anything Marco thinks is in our best national interest,"" Sen. Thom Tillis (R–N.C.) told NOTUS last week in response to a question about the Rubio/Musk turf war. Tillis also chalked up the incident to a case of having ""a lot of cooks in the kitchen"" but said there should be no doubt that Rubio, in this case, is ""head chef.""

Maybe it was all just a mix-up. But while the situation with USAID and Rubio is the most high-profile, it is not the only example of DOGE and Musk operating like the very deep state Republicans used to criticize.

Take, for another example, how the Trump administration is working to exempt DOGE from the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). As Reason's C.J. Ciaramella reported, Justice Department lawyers are now arguing that the DOGE does not have to respond to FOIA requests because it is no longer part of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

Much of the office of the president is exempt from FOIA (the OMB is a bit of an outlier), but that maneuver still ""runs contrary to Trump and Elon Musk's promises and stated goals of delivering open, transparent government to the public,"" Ciaramella wrote. Indeed, Musk has claimed that ""all aspects of the government must be fully transparent and accountable to the people,"" Musk posted on X earlier this month. ""No exceptions.""

Well, some exceptions, apparently.

Musk's role within the executive branch is starting to look every bit as vague and unaccountable as the shadowy deep state operatives that Trump campaigned against—and that lack of clarity might soon undermine some of what DOGE has accomplished. In a statement to a U.S. district judge in February, a White House attorney explained that Musk is a ""special government employee"" and an adviser to the president, not the actual head of the DOGE or even an employee of the department.

So who is running things? The White House said last week that Amy Gleason is now the administrator of the DOGE project. But Musk remains the face of the effort, and federal judges assessing the legality of DOGE's actions seem to have questions about the chain of command.

""Based on the limited record I have before me, I have some concerns about the constitutionality of U.S.D.S.'s structure and operations,"" Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said during a hearing in the federal district court last week. The New York Times notes that she ""expressed particular concern that [Musk's role] violated the appointments clause of the Constitution, which requires leaders of federal agencies to be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.""

You have to assume that other federal judges hearing other legal and constitutional challenges to DOGE's spending cuts will soon be asking similar questions. Even if the Trump administration can fall back on the claim that those changes are authorized by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), judges are likely to look less favorably on these maneuvers if they appear to be happening on the orders of someone who holds no actual power (and, don't forget, runs a business empire that's significantly funded by government contracts).

Overruling the decisions made by legally appointed officials. Dodging transparency. Refusing to identify who is running the show. Are Musk and the DOGE just the deep state by a different name?

Some clarity and transparency from the White House about Musk's official status and the limits of DOGE's powers would go a long way toward establishing the necessary constitutional credibility to make any of these cuts stick—and would have practical benefits too, like clearing up whether federal workers are supposed to respond to his emailed demands.

It is fair to point out, as Reason's Christian Britschgi has, that Musk is not the first personal adviser to the president who has occupied an unclear and constitutionally dubious role while exercising vast, unofficial powers from the White House.

But Trump promised to demolish the deep state, not reshuffle the seating chart. Instead, he seems to be delivering a new version of the deep state, but one oriented toward conservative ends—which is, in fairness, what some conservatives wanted.

That might be good enough for some Republicans who can't see past the next election. Principled conservatives and libertarians, however, should balk at the constitutionally dubious nature of all this and recognize that a smaller government with a more powerful set of unaccountable executive officials is unlikely to be much of a win for liberty.",Center,True
"Hours After Trump Paused All Arms To Ukraine, Zelensky Reportedly Ready To Sign Minerals Deal Under 'Trump's Strong Leadership'",https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-03-04-1240/ukraine-war-hours-after-trump-paused-all-arms-ukraine-zelensky-reportedly-ready,ZeroHedge,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/zerohedge-media-bias,Lean Right,https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/white-house-wants-recorded-apology-zelensky-mend-relations,"Update(1425ET): Is President Trump going to announce 'mission accomplished' on the Ukraine minerals deal during tonight's speech before a joint session of Congress? A breaking Reuters headline strongly suggests this is the case:

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration and Ukraine plan to sign the much-debated minerals deal following a disastrous Oval Office meeting Friday in which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was dismissed from the building, four people familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.

President Donald Trump has told his advisers that he wants to announce the agreement in his address to Congress Tuesday evening, three of the sources said, cautioning that the deal had yet to be signed and the situation could change.

But as we've seen in the last several days since Friday, a lot can happen in one afternoon. Zelensky gave an 'almost apology' on Tuesday (below), but not quite what the administration seems to be asking for.

As of yet, ""It was unclear if the deal has changed,"" Reuters notes. ""The deal that was to be signed last week included no explicit security guarantees for Ukraine but gave the U.S. access to revenues from Ukraine's natural resources. It also envisaged the Ukrainian government contributing 50% of future monetization of any state-owned natural resources to a U.S.-Ukraine managed reconstruction investment fund.""

A key caveat... we've seen these trial positive news balloons prematurely floated before:

This is all happening less than 24 hours after the Trump White House ordered an end to military aid to Ukraine, or at least a ""pause"". Zelensky has meanwhile declared he's ready to move forward under Trump's ""strong leadership"" - but we're unlikely to ultimately know for sure until Trump's address tonight. And then there's the question of if there will be a final signing ceremony, or if both sides have finally agreed to all the details, such as Zelensky's demanded strong security guarantees.

* * *

Trump wants an explicit public apology from Zelensky - that's according to Fox White House correspondent Peter Doocy, who described the following on Monday...

""Nothing is gonna happen with this minerals deal until Zelensky goes in front of cameras and makes an explicit public apology for the way he behaved in the Oval Office with that meeting,"" Doocy said in a live broadcast from the White House lawn. President Zelensky on Tuesday is reiterating he's ""ready"" to sign the minerals deal with the US.

This is because in the wake of the disastrous Zelensky visit, ""there's now quite a disconnect happening here at the White House with their allies in Kiev.""

As for the requirement of a recorded apology by Zelensky to make amends, Doocy said he was specifically ""told by a senior official"" in the Trump administration.

President Zelensky himself had this weekend said he still hopes for ""constructive dialogue"" with Washington and has expressed willingness to still sign the agreement.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio had just hours after Zelensky left the White House Friday advised the Ukrainian leader to apologize ""for wasting our time"" and for ""turning this thing into the fiasco for him that it became."" Zelensky has still not done so. There are these 'regret' statements issues from his office Tuesday:

the way the White House meeting turned out was regrettable

Kyiv ready to work under 'Trump's strong leadership' for peace: Zelensky

Zelensky says wants to 'make things right' with Trump

“My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump’s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts,” Zelenskiy said Tuesday on X. “The first stages could be the release of prisoners and truce in the sky — ban on missiles, long-ranged drones, bombs on energy and other civilian infrastructure — and truce in the sea immediately, if Russia will do the same.” Below is Zelensky's full, latest public statement:

GOP Congressional leaders are meanwhile still holding out hope that a deal will be reached. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), a co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Ukraine Caucus, said he's confident a minerals deal will still ""be signed in short order.""

Watch Fox's Doocy explain what's required of Zelensky below, based on US admin officials...

""We are 100% getting this train back on the tracks,"" Fitzpatrick wrote on X on Monday. ""This mineral deal will be signed in short order, which will lead to a strong long-term economic partnership between the United States and Ukraine, and which will ultimately and naturally lead to security assistance.""

But it sounds like from the White House's perspective a lot will be determined by Zelensky's actions in the coming days. Here's what US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told CNN on Sunday: ""it’s unclear whether President Zelensky, particularly after what we saw on Friday, is ready to transition Ukraine to an end to this war, and to negotiate and have to compromise."" Waltz then said that ""we need a leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians, and end this war"" - in remarks that hinted at regime change in Kiev.

Canada and China say the fentanyl crisis is just a pretext for Trump's new tariffs,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-03-04-1236/donald-trump-canada-and-china-say-fentanyl-crisis-just-pretext-trumps-new,NPR (Online News),https://www.allsides.com/news-source/npr-media-bias,Lean Left,https://www.npr.org/2025/03/04/nx-s1-5317494/tariffs-fentanyl-canada-mexico-trump,"Officials in Canada and China are blasting the Trump administration for using illegal street fentanyl as justification for new trade tariffs that go into effect today.

In a statement, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called Trump's criticism ""unjustified,"" noting that fentanyl seizures at the U.S. northern border have dropped to ""near-zero.""

""While less than 1 percent of the fentanyl intercepted at the U.S. border comes from Canada, we have worked relentlessly to address this scourge,"" Trudeau said. He pointed to $1.3 billion Canada is spending on new security measures along the border.

Both countries called the link between fentanyl smuggling and trade barriers unjustified and announced plans to retaliate.

President Trump is expected to speak about the clash Tuesday night in an address before Congress. In a statement Monday, the White House once again pointed to drugs as a key motivation for new U.S. trade barriers, describing the situation as a ""national emergency.""

""While President Trump gave both Canada and Mexico ample opportunity to curb the dangerous cartel activity and influx of lethal drugs flowing into our country, they have failed to adequately address the situation,"" the U.S. statement said.

The U.S. on Tuesday imposed 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China.

Trump has continued to describe fentanyl overdoses as an escalating crisis in the U.S., despite the fact that fatal overdoses have plummeted since 2023 — down nearly 24%, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Trudeau says Canada will retaliate with tariffs on $155 billion of U.S. goods, phased in over the next three weeks.

Chinese officials said they too have already stepped up cooperation with the U.S. on drug interdiction efforts. Speaking Monday, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian accused the Trump administration of using ""the fentanyl issue as a pretext"" to threaten China.

""The U.S.'s attempts to politicize and weaponize trade and economic issues, levy tariff hikes on Chinese imports under the pretext of fentanyl, and create blocks to its normal trade, investment and economic cooperation with China will only harm its own economic interests and international credibility,"" Jian said.

Many of the industrial chemicals used to make fentanyl — and other synthetic street drugs — have been linked to firms operating in mainland China. In the past, however, Chinese officials have described the fentanyl crisis as a domestic concern inside the U.S. that should be solved by curbing demand and street drug use.

Beijing responded to the Trump administration's latest tariff hike by slapping additional tariffs of 10-15% on a variety of U.S. agricultural imports, including chicken, pork, soy and beef, starting next week, China's finance ministry announced.

Mexico has also stepped up law enforcement pressure on drug cartels, staging raids against fentanyl labs and arresting gang leaders. Last month, Mexico transferred 29 cartel leaders into U.S. custody.

Speaking on Tuesday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her country, too, would retaliate with 25% tariffs on U.S. goods.

""There is no motive or reason, nor justification that supports this decision that will affect our people and our nations,"" she said.

Sheinbaum said she would detail which American products and industries would be targeted on Sunday.

Data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection shows fentanyl seizures at the U.S.-Mexico border have dropped by roughly 50% in recent months.

This escalating trade fight comes at a time when fatal overdoses from fentanyl are plunging in the U.S., with deaths linked to the synthetic opioid down more than 30% over the last year, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",Center,False

Advertisement

This development comes after leaked video footage showing one of the fights went viral on social media. The officers are facing a slew of charges, including “child endangerment and abuse, conspiracy, and battery,” according to a press release.

The indictment alleges that the officers allowed and, in some instances, encouraged 69 fights to occur between youths at Los Padrinos during the period from July 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023. The indictment stems from an investigation launched by the California Department of Justice after video footage of one of the so-called ""gladiator fights"" leaked in January 2024. Twenty-two of the 30 officers were arraigned today at Los Angeles Superior Court. The remaining officers will be arraigned on April 18, 2025.

Bonta said correctional officers “have a duty to ensure the safety and well-being of those under their care” and that the defendants “did just the opposite – overseeing ‘gladiator fights’ when they should have intervened.”

The video footage showed multiple youths taking turns punching and kicking a teenager in a “day room” in the facility. The officers can be seen standing around doing nothing to stop the assault. Some of them laughed and shook hands with the juveniles involved in the violence.

The Los Angeles Times obtained a copy of the video after the 17-year-old victim’s attorney requested that he be released before his upcoming trial because he was not safe at the facility.

The indictment alleges that the officers not only allowed the fights to occur – they actively supported it. One inmate suffered a broken nose and head trauma.

The officers allegedly doctored reports to give alternate explanations for the injuries the juveniles sustained from the fights. Officer Taneha Brooks in a report characterized one of the more severe assaults as a mutual fight that she stopped after intervening. Yet, the video footage clearly shows her doing nothing.

Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall has an extensive history of safety violations and operational problems, according to the Los Angeles Times.

California’s Board of State and Community Corrections ordered Los Padrinos closed late last year after it repeatedly failed inspections and was deemed “unsuitable” to house youths. The majority of the juveniles incarcerated in Los Angeles County are housed in Los Padrinos because the board previously shuttered the county’s other two juvenile halls — Barry J. Nidorf in Sylmar and Central Juvenile Hall in L.A. — following increases in violence and instability in the halls exacerbated by a staffing crisis.

The probation department refused the state’s order to close Los Padrinos, and state board members have said they don’t know what legal recourse they have to enforce it. The California Attorney General’s office has previously declined to address the issue.

Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Miguel Espinoza is weighing a request from the L.A. County public defender’s office to remove all of its clients from Los Padrinos, based on the board’s finding that its unsafe for youths.

“The probation system and its underlying culture are broken,” Los Angeles County Public Defender Ricardo Garcia said in a statement Monday. “Accountability for those who have failed to protect our youth is long overdue—there is no justice in a system that abuses the very youth it is entrusted to care for.”

The LA County Probation department released a statement in which it claimed “accountability is a cornerstone of our mission, and we have zero tolerance for misconduct of any peace officers, especially those dealing with young people in our system.”",Lean Right,False
"The Trump administration may exclude government spending from GDP, obscuring the impact of DOGE cuts",https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-03-04-0848/economy-and-jobs-trump-administration-may-exclude-government-spending-gdp,Associated Press,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/associated-press-media-bias,Left,https://apnews.com/article/trump-gdp-economy-government-spending-lutnick-7414ba1bd441bd4bf64620bfd66923b2,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that government spending could be separated from gross domestic product reports, in response to questions about whether the spending cuts pushed by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency could possibly cause an economic downturn.

“You know that governments historically have messed with GDP,” Lutnick said on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.” “They count government spending as part of GDP. So I’m going to separate those two and make it transparent.”

Doing so could potentially complicate or distort a fundamental measure of the U.S. economy’s health. Government spending is traditionally included in the GDP because changes in taxes, spending, deficits and regulations by the government can impact the path of overall growth. GDP reports already include extensive details on government spending, offering a level of transparency for economists.

Musk’s efforts to downsize federal agencies could result in the layoffs of tens of thousands of federal workers, whose lost income could potentially reduce their spending, affecting businesses and the economy at large.

AP AUDIO: The Trump administration may exclude government spending from GDP, obscuring the impact of DOGE cuts

AP correspondent Julie Walker reports the Trump administration may exclude government spending from GDP, obscuring the impact of DOGE cuts.

The commerce secretary’s remarks echoed Musk’s arguments made Friday on X that government spending doesn’t create value for the economy.

“A more accurate measure of GDP would exclude government spending,” Musk wrote on his social media platform. “Otherwise, you can scale GDP artificially high by spending money on things that don’t make people’s lives better.”

The argument as articulated so far by Trump administration officials appears to play down the economic benefits created by some forms of government spending that can shape an economy’s trajectory.

“If the government buys a tank, that’s GDP,” Lutnick said Sunday. “But paying 1,000 people to think about buying a tank is not GDP. That is wasted inefficiency, wasted money. And cutting that, while it shows in GDP, we’re going to get rid of that.”

The Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis published its most recent GDP report on Thursday, showing that the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.3% in the final three months of last year.

The report makes it possible to measure the forces driving the economy, showing that the gains at the end of last year were largely driven by greater consumer spending and an upward revision to federal government spending related to defense. Still, the federal government’s component of the GDP report for all of 2024 increased at 2.6%, slightly lower than overall economic growth last year of 2.8%.

In the GDP report, government spending accounts for almost one-fifth of people’s personal income, which totaled more than $24.6 trillion last year. This includes Social Security payments, benefits for military veterans, Medicare and Medicaid and other programs. But the report also measures the amount of people’s personal incomes that are paid in taxes to the government.

The government is not always a contributor to GDP growth and can subtract from it, which is what happened in 2022 as pandemic-related aid expired.

Lutnick said that the Trump administration would balance the federal budget with spending cuts, saying that would help growth and reduce the interest rates paid by consumers.

“When we balance the budget of the United States of America, interest rates are going to come smashing down,” Lutnick said. “This is going to be the best economy anybody’s ever seen. And to bet against it is foolish.”",Center,False
Supreme Court will hear from U.S. gun makers sued by Mexico for $10 billion,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-03-04-0846/gun-control-and-gun-rights-supreme-court-will-hear-us-gun-makers-sued-mexico-10,Washington Times,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/washington-times-bias,Lean Right,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/mar/4/arguments-10b-lawsuit-mexico-filed-us-gunmakers-heard-supreme-court/,"The Supreme Court will hear arguments Tuesday in a $10 billion lawsuit Mexico filed against top firearm manufacturers in the U.S., alleging their business practices have fueled cartel gun violence.

The gun makers reject those claims. They appealed to the Supreme Court to overturn a ruling that let the lawsuit move forward even though U.S. law largely shields gun makers from lawsuits.

Depending on how the court rules, it could also affect a narrow legal path that helped families of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School secure a $73 million settlement from the gun maker Remington.

Here’s what to know about the case:

Mexico has strict gun laws and has just one store where people can legally buy firearms. But thousands of guns are smuggled in by the country’s powerful drug cartels.

The Mexican government says 70% of those weapons come from the United States. The lawsuit claims that companies knew weapons were being sold to traffickers who smuggled them into Mexico and decided to cash in on that market.

The defendants include big-name manufacturers such as Smith & Wesson, Beretta, Colt and Glock. The lawsuit is still in its early stages, and if the court does side with Mexico it would still have to prove the allegations.

The gun makers say there is no evidence the industry allows trafficking and they disagree with Mexico’s data about how many weapons originate in the U.S. The Mexican government, not U.S. gun makers, is responsible for enforcing the laws and fighting crime, they argue.

The industry is shielded from most civil lawsuits arising from crimes committed using firearms under a 20-year-old law, though Mexico has argued that it doesn’t apply to crimes committed outside of the U.S.

The gun companies are asking the justices to overturn an appeals court ruling that allowed the case to move forward.

The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found it fell under an exception to the shield law for situations in which firearm companies are accused of knowingly violating the law.

That exception has come up in other cases.

The victims of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook argued it applied to their lawsuit because the gun maker had violated state law in the marketing of the AR-15 rifle used in the shooting, in which 20 first graders and six educators were killed.

The Supreme Court declined to hear that case. After reaching the $73 million settlement, the families said they hoped it would lead to more safety and accountability.

Depending on how the justices rule, their eventual findings could narrow or close that legal path.",Lean Right,True

Yet two months into 2025, US stocks have lagged Europe and Chinese stocks, bitcoin is sliding and concerns about inflation are mounting.

US stocks largely slid Tuesday as investors digested a poor outlook from a consumer confidence survey that showed heightened concern about inflation. The Conference Board’s consumer confidence index saw its largest monthly decline since August 2021.

The Dow wavered Tuesday morning but closed at 43,621, or 0.37% higher, after rising in afternoon trading. The benchmark S&P 500 closed lower by about 0.47% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 1.35%.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed lower for the fourth session in a row. All three major US stock indexes are in the red since President Donald Trump took office on January 20; the Nasdaq is down more than 1% since the start of 2025.

US stocks had rallied after Trump’s reelection in November and the S&P 500 closed at a record high just last week. Yet US markets are fretting as signs of lingering inflation are on the rise and uncertainty around Trump’s trade and tariff policy persists. Investor sentiment on Tuesday moved into extreme fear territory for the first time since December, according to CNN’s Fear & Greed Index.

As investors brace for uncertainty, they are likely moving away from stocks into safer assets like government bonds and dumping risky assets like cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, which surged as high as $106,000 around Trump’s inauguration, is down about 16% in the past month, trading around $88,000 on Tuesday.

The yield on the 10-year US Treasury slid to 4.29% on Tuesday as investors piled into bonds, signaling concerns about uncertainty and weaker-than-expected economic growth.

Walmart, a bellwether for the US economy, spooked investors last week after it signaled slower sales in 2025 than previously expected.

The VIX, Wall Street’s fear gauge, surged Tuesday to its highest level this year before retreating.

While US stocks might be stretched, global markets are shining. Europe’s STOXX 600 Index has gained almost 10% this year. In China, equities continue to outperform the US.

“The release of DeepSeek’s LLM has reignited interest in China tech (now up over 35% from its January low), while the developments around Ukraine are triggering a surge in performance for European tech companies and companies exposed to potential reconstruction,” analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a February 25 note.

Testing the bull market

The Dow and the broader S&P 500 have gained since Trump’s reelection in November and are still slightly in the green since the start of 2025.

Yet the S&P 500 posted back-to-back gains of more than 20% in 2023 and 2024, raising questions about whether the bull rally can continue in 2025.

Tech stocks, which pushed US indexes higher in 2024, have wavered in recent days. Nvidia (NVDA), Palantir (PLTR) and Tesla (TSLA) were leading the selloff in stocks on Tuesday. Palantir, a star of 2024, has fallen about 30% in the past five days.

Tesla shares tumbled 8.4% on Tuesday, bringing the company’s market value below the $1 trillion mark.

Two out of three traders believe the market is overvalued, according to Charles Schwab’s quarterly trader client sentiment survey. Yet bullish traders still outnumber bearish traders 51% to 34%.

“It’s clear that the majority of traders believe there’s some froth in the market, but on balance they also feel like there’s still more room for the bulls to run,” said James Kostulias, head of trading services at Charles Schwab.

While there is looming uncertainty, some strategists think fundamentals like strong corporate earnings will drive stocks higher.

“While we continue to expect volatility ahead as investors grapple with the potential impact of Trump’s proposed policies, we believe markets are likely to refocus on fundamentals that should support the equity rally further,” said Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note Tuesday.",Center,False
"Trump Says He’ll Defund Schools, Universities that Allow ‘Illegal Protests'",https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-03-04-0840/donald-trump-trump-says-he-ll-defund-schools-universities-allow-illegal,Breitbart News,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/breitbart,Far Right,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/03/04/trump-says-hell-defund-schools-universities-that-allow-illegal-protests/,"President Donald Trump says he will cut off federal funding to schools and universities that allow “illegal protests.”

Trump announced in a post on Truth Social on Tuesday, “All Federal Funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests.”

“Agitators will be imprisoned/or permanently sent back to the country from which they came. American students will be permanently expelled or, depending on on the crime, arrested. NO MASKS! Thank you for your attention to this matter,” he added.

Trump has leveraged federal funding several times already as a way to shape policy in schools, universities, and college campuses.

RELATED — Mostly Peaceful! Bottles, Chair Thrown at NYPD During NYU Anti-Israel Protest

For instance, as Breitbart News first reported, Trump signed an executive order last month halting funding for schools and universities that impose coronavirus vaccine mandates on students.

The order would prohibit “federal funds from being used to support or subsidize an educational service agency, state education agency, local education agency, elementary school, secondary school, or institution of higher education that requires students to have received a COVID-19 vaccination to attend in-person education programs,” a White House document read.

Trump also signed an executive order to defund K-12 schools that teach transgender ideology and critical race theory, as Breitbart News noted:

The order will give the Department of Education 90 days to create a plan about how to weed out CRT and radical gender ideology instruction in K-12 schools, according to a White House memo first obtained by the Daily Caller. Trump notably promised on the campaign trail to sign an order defunding schools that teach “Critical Race Theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content.”

The White House memo also reportedly states that the order will direct the Attorney General to work with state attorneys general and district attorneys “to file actions against teachers and school officials who sexually exploit minors or practice medicine without a license through ‘social transition’ practices.”

Trump’s announcement Tuesday comes after college campuses and universities across the country were sites of pro-Hamas and anti-Israel protests during the end of the Biden administration.",Right,False

There Is No Musk Exception in the Constitution,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-03-04-0509/politics-there-no-musk-exception-constitution,New York Times (Opinion),https://www.allsides.com/news-source/new-york-times-opinion-media-bias,Left,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/opinion/elon-musk-trump-constitution.html,"It’s difficult to convey the full magnitude of the legal chaos emanating from the Trump administration. It goes well beyond the violation of individual laws — much of the past month has featured what feels like an assault on the very idea of law as a binding constraint.

This has been especially acute when it comes to personnel, both hiring and firing. For the dozens of high-level officials President Trump has fired in violation of clear legal restrictions, he is likely to be at least somewhat vindicated by a Supreme Court that has been increasingly skeptical of laws limiting the president’s ability to fire at will.

But Mr. Trump is on decidedly shakier ground when it comes to how he has empowered Elon Musk, who is perhaps the most important figure in the new administration based on the efforts taken to reshape the federal government through his Department of Government Efficiency initiative. That’s most likely why the White House has tied itself in knots trying to explain to courts and to the public the nature of Mr. Musk’s role. Presumably, that’s because it seems clear that the Constitution does not allow it.

That’s true at the level of broad constitutional principles — particularly the principle that sovereignty flows from the people and that only officials selected through constitutional methods get to wield power in our name. This insight seems to undergird the growing mobilization against Elon Musk. Protesters at Tesla showrooms who are displaying signs that say “no one voted for Elon Musk” are making, intentionally or not, a constitutionally inflected claim.

Mr. Musk’s power also is squarely at odds with concrete constitutional provisions. While the Constitution is largely silent on removal — Mr. Trump’s arguments that the Constitution gives him limitless power to fire are atextual — the document is quite specific when it comes to appointment.

Supreme Court cases make clear that individuals who serve in “continuing” positions and who exercise “significant authority” on behalf of the United States must be appointed consistent with the Constitution’s Appointments Clause. As far as I can tell, Mr. Musk hasn’t been.

The Appointments Clause — part of Article II, the source of Mr. Trump’s virtually boundless conception of presidential power — sets forth two methods of appointment of what are called “officers of the United States.” “Principal” officers must be nominated by the president and are subject to the advice and consent of the Senate. For “inferior officers,” the Constitution allows Congress to give the appointment power to the president alone — that is, without Senate confirmation — or to the head of a department, or to the courts of law. Inferior officers must be subject to the supervision of someone other than the president; if you report directly to the president, you’re a principal officer.

This means that the individuals who wield the most authority — principal officers — are subject to both the public scrutiny and the check that is supposed to be imposed by Senate confirmation.

Mr. Musk appears to be wielding significant power, as evidenced by his presence at the administration’s first cabinet meeting last week. He was the first to speak after the president’s introduction. He boasted about pushing federal employees to respond to an email about their work, inveighed about the federal deficit and casually disclosed that his team had inadvertently canceled funding for Ebola prevention — an error he claims was quickly rectified, but may not have been. The email he mentioned appears to have been dashed off without advance warning even to the cabinet.

The Supreme Court has found that a range of government workers exercise enough authority that they are officers and must be appointed through one of the methods outlined in the Constitution — including many who exercise far less authority than Mr. Musk appears to. In 2018, for example, the court held that administrative law judges at the Securities and Exchange Commission were officers of the United States. In a more recent decision, the court explained that “thousands of officers wield executive power” on the president’s behalf, power that “acquires its legitimacy and accountability to the public through ‘a clear and effective chain of command’ down from the president.”

Indeed, the main basis on which Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the classified-documents case against Mr. Trump was that the special counsel Jack Smith was an officer of the United States who had not been constitutionally appointed. The specifics of her conclusion were highly dubious — but she was right that “the Appointments Clause is a critical constitutional restriction stemming from the separation of powers.”

Two legal cases are making the argument that Mr. Musk’s power cannot be squared with the Appointments Clause. They contend that if Mr. Musk is as powerful as he seems to be, he must be appointed consistent with the Constitution — and he’s most likely a principal officer, which means Senate confirmation.

One case, in Maryland, was brought by a group of current and former federal employees and contractors; another, in Washington, D.C., was brought by a number of states. In a hearing last week, the judge in the Maryland case, Theodore Chuang, said that he was “highly suspicious” of the administration’s explanation for Mr. Musk’s role and characterized its insistence that he has no formal role in the Department of Government Efficiency as apparently “factually inaccurate.”

The district judge in the Washington case has made clear that allegations suggest that Mr. Musk has “rapidly taken steps to fundamentally reshape the executive branch,” with no apparent “source of legal authority.” His actions appear to describe “precisely the ‘executive abuses’ that the Appointments Clause seeks to prevent.”

Based on well-settled principles, these claims should succeed in the cases. The decisions are unlikely to invalidate what has been done to the federal government by those involved in Mr. Musk’s initiative — but they should say that Mr. Musk cannot continue to exercise this authority without a constitutionally permissible appointment.

There is no small irony in Mr. Musk’s exercising this amount of extraconstitutional authority. Mr. Trump’s allies have consistently alluded to the principle of democratic legitimacy in their broadsides against the administrative state. When Mr. Musk laid out the principles of DOGE in an opinion essay, written with Vivek Ramaswamy, they said that “most government enforcement decisions and discretionary expenditures aren’t made by the democratically elected president or even his political appointees” but by people who were, they stressed, “unelected” and “unappointed.” This, they said, is “antidemocratic and antithetical to the founders’ vision.”

The system the founders created includes clear requirements for ensuring legitimacy and accountability in positions of significant government power. Americans should insist that if President Trump wants Mr. Musk in government, there’s a way to do that: appoint him as the Constitution requires.",Left,True
Negotiations to avert a shutdown sputter as disputes over DOGE cuts persist,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-03-04-0507/politics-negotiations-avert-shutdown-sputter-disputes-over-doge-cuts-persist,CNBC,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnbc,Center,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/04/negotiations-to-avert-a-shutdown-sputter-as-disputes-over-doge-cuts-persist.html,"WASHINGTON — Congress is careening toward a government shutdown in just 11 days as the discord between the two parties over funding talks grows, with no clear path to reach a deal.

The government is set to run out of money at the end of next Friday, March 14. Republicans control the House and the Senate, but they need Democratic support to pass a funding bill as it is subject to the Senate's 60-vote threshold.

Hopes of a full funding deal have faded, so President Donald Trump and congressional leaders are falling back on a short-term bill to keep the government open on autopilot, most likely through the end of the fiscal year. But even that is running into obstacles.

""I'm not optimistic. I don't think we're going to have a budget,"" said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. ""My Democratic colleagues have been insistent that we include language limiting the involvement of the executive branch on spending decisions.""

Democrats have pushed to include constraints on Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk's attempts to close down or slash agencies without congressional approval. But Republicans say that's a nonstarter as they support the Department of Government Efficiency-led budget cuts, which they say are about rooting out waste.

""Democrats have to help negotiate this, and they've to this point shown no interest in finding a reasonable solution for that,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

Johnson called for a measure ""to freeze funding at current levels, to make sure that the government can stay open while we begin to incorporate all these savings that we're finding through the DOGE effort and these other sources of revenue that President Trump's policies are bringing to the table.""

In a statement Sunday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Democrats are interested in a deal that ""promotes the economic well-being, health and safety of everyday Americans."" But he added that ""there has been zero outreach from the Trump administration and House Republicans have walked away from the negotiating table.""

The White House sent Congress a request for add-ons to the bill — or ""anomalies"" — that include $32 billion in transfer authority for the Defense Department, which some Democrats consider a slush fund. The request includes a $20 billion cut to IRS enforcement and an increase in funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation operations. The document was viewed by NBC News and authenticated by two sources.

""I think the White House anomaly requests are completely inadequate,"" Sen. Patty Murray, of Washington, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said Monday when she was asked about the request. ""And again, the solution is in front of us: short-term CR, tell our committee to get to work. Democrats are at the table. We are ready to do that.""

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the chair of the Appropriations Committee, told NBC News on Monday that she's ""working on a two-track approach"" that includes a full-year continuing resolution and a short-term bill of ""maybe a month"" to give more time for a detailed agreement.

For Johnson, the first question is whether he can find enough votes to pass a stopgap bill in the House with a narrow GOP majority of 218-215. That may require Democratic votes as scores of conservative Republicans routinely vote against funding the government.

Ordinarily, Democrats support short-term bills en masse. But this time, the GOP's insistence on protecting or codifying the cuts by DOGE has given Democrats a point of opposition to rally around — after they've seen grassroots anger from federal workers and veterans. Democrats see the Trump-Musk effort as trampling on Congress' power over spending, and some say they won't support a bill that would let it continue.

In addition, at least two moderate House Republicans have already blasted the idea of another continuing resolution.

Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, argued that Congress needs to pass regular appropriation bills rather than kick the can down the road with a CR.

""I am a NO on the CR. Congress needs to do its job and pass a conservative budget!"" he wrote on X. ""CR's are code for Continued Rubberstamp of fraud, waste, and abuse.""

Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., an Afghanistan and Iraq war veteran, slammed the CR, saying it wouldn't allow for much-needed additional military funding.

""A continuing resolution (CR) is bad for our military and weakens our national security,"" Bacon wrote Sunday on X, without saying how he'd vote. ""A CR means new weapons programs cannot get started. A year-long CR means we are not serious about building a military that will deter China, Russia and Iran.""

But Bacon said Monday that White House officials reached out to him after his post and acknowledged that ""anomalies"" were needed to ""plus-up"" military spending.

Johnson huddled with his GOP leadership team as lawmakers returned to the Capitol on Monday evening and got support for the CR plan.

Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, said he was on board, even though the stopgap measure doesn't codify the DOGE cuts cheered by the ultraconservative group. All Freedom Caucus members voted last week to pass a budget resolution that calls for raising the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.

""I think we're charting new territory here with President Trump and his striving to get government efficiency going,"" Harris said as he left the speaker's office.

Asked whether he's worried about a shutdown, Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., a Freedom Caucus member, replied: ""Nah.""

""This town is very interesting. Deals seem to, like, fall out of the sky when they need to,"" Donalds told NBC News while saying ""the Dems are being ridiculous"" by opposing DOGE cuts.

Republicans are seeking to juggle a funding bill with an unrelated effort to pass a huge party-line package to advance parts of Trump's agenda, which has drawn unified Democratic opposition.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said Democrats will continue ""telling the truth about what the Republicans are trying to do"" and said it's the majority party's job to make a serious offer.

""The Republicans have the majority,"" Warren told reporters Monday. ""They need to put forward a package that can pass the House and the Senate. That's their job.""",Center,True

""I wouldn't say so,"" Osadchuk told Newsmax's ""National Report.""

""And again, it was a big manipulation with the [approval] figures. When President [Donald] Trump was saying about 4% support of Zelenskyy, which is not correct at all, based on all information which we currently have, President Zelenskyy has more than 55% support in Ukraine and, in fact, all different parties, despite opposition or coalition, has consensus that during this stage of the war, it's simply impossible to conduct elections in Ukraine,"" he added.

""I would be happy to see elections in Ukraine as in the Parliament, as presidential elections. But when we have 1 million people in the front-line, 7 million internally displaced persons, and not less than 5 million of adults in Europe as refugees and daily attacks — don't forget that even Kyiv, under daily attacks of Russian kamikaze drones — what kind of elections we can talk about?

""So that's why we have consensus that we need to continue to fight. We need to continue to try to save our country and our nation. And yes, Zelenskyy remains a legitimate president of Ukraine until the end of this war.""

Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance called Zelenskyy disrespectful during their White House meeting Friday over bringing an end to the Russia-Ukraine war.

Trump also debated Zelenskyy when Ukraine's president pushed for U.S. security commitments to keep his country safe from further Russian aggression.

""You're gambling with the lives of millions of people,"" Trump said. ""You're gambling with World War III, and what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country that's backed you far more than a lot of people say they should have.""

Zelenskyy stirred Trump's responses by insisting that promises of peace from Vladimir Putin can't be trusted, noting the Russian leader's history of broken promises. Trump said Putin hasn't broken agreements with him.

Subscribe here.

Welcome to the Logoff. Today I’m covering another purge at the Justice Department, where Donald Trump’s administration is taking revenge against high-ranking career prosecutors who prosecuted Trump allies over January 6 and in other criminal cases.

What’s the latest? The head of the Washington, DC, US attorney’s office demoted seven high-ranking prosecutors on Friday, Reuters reports, moving them to entry-level positions in a bid to force them to quit. Those demoted include:

The leader of the “Capitol siege prosecution unit”

A prosecutor who worked on criminal cases against Trump advisers Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro

Prosecutors who worked on criminal cases against the heads of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, two far-right extremist groups that worked to steal the 2020 election on Trump’s behalf

The experienced attorneys will now mostly handle misdemeanors and low-level crimes. The demotions follow the January firing of US attorneys who prosecuted Trump over his attempt to steal the 2020 election.

Why were they demoted? Ed Martin, the Trump-appointed new head of the DC office, claimed the moves reflected a shift in priorities and a focus on local crime in DC. But the Trump-related experiences of the officials selected — and the move of experienced prosecutors to entry-level jobs — make it difficult to believe this wasn’t an act of retribution.

What’s the big picture? The demotions send a strong signal to prosecutors that there will be consequences for officials who try to hold Trump and his allies accountable to the law. It’s also another blow against the DOJ’s independence, as Trump works to remake law enforcement as a tool he can wield for political ends. And the move weakens the US attorney’s office in Washington, which is tasked with prosecuting abuses of power by some of the country’s most powerful people.

""Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,"" Trump said in an address to Congress on Tuesday while quoting from the letter. Trump also said he had been in ""serious discussions with Russia"" and had ""received strong signals that they are ready for peace"". ""Wouldn't that be beautiful?"" he said. ""It's time to stop this madness. It's time to halt the killing. It's time to end this senseless war. If you want to end wars you have to talk to both sides."" Trump was expected to further outline his plans for Ukraine and Russia in the speech to Congress , but did not reveal any further details on how he plans to end Europe's biggest conflict since World War Two. Trump said Ukraine was ready to sign a minerals deal with the U.S., which Washington says is crucial to secure continued U.S. backing for Ukraine's defense. Four sources told Reuters that the Trump administration and Ukraine plan to sign the deal in return for military aid, which Trump has paused. But later on Tuesday U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News, ""There is no signing planned,"" according to a post on X by a Fox reporter. Trump gave no further details on the minerals deal, leaving its fate unclear. Early on Tuesday, Zelenskiy pledged to repair relations with the U.S. after what he described as a ""regrettable"" Oval Office clash with Trump last week. Zelenskiy said he wanted to ""make things right"" and was ready ""any time and in any convenient format"" to sign the minerals deal, which he left on the table during a visit to Washington after the Oval Office argument with Trump. His statement came a day after Trump halted military aid to Ukraine, his latest move to upend U.S. policy and adopt a more conciliatory stance toward Russia. ""My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump’s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts,"" Zelenskiy said in his statement on X. The statement made no mention of the pause in U.S. military supplies. Zelenskiy's statement was clearly aimed at stressing Kyiv's gratitude following the explosive confrontation at the White House, at which Trump and Vice President JD Vance scolded Zelenskiy as insufficiently appreciative. ""We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence,"" Zelenskiy wrote. ""Our meeting in Washington ... did not go the way it was supposed to be. It is regrettable that it happened this way. It is time to make things right."" Zelenskiy outlined a path towards a peace agreement, which he said could begin with a release of prisoners and a halt to air and sea attacks, if Russia did the same. ""Then we want to move very fast through all next stages and to work with the U.S. to agree a strong final deal.""

""We only have one plan - to win and to survive."" In Moscow, the Kremlin said cutting off U.S. military aid to Ukraine was the best possible step towards peace, although it was waiting to confirm Trump's move. U.S. Democrats have raised an outcry over Trump's abrupt pivot towards Russia, the most dramatic geopolitical shift in generations for Washington, where governments under both parties since the 1940s have prioritized defending Europe from a hostile Moscow. The chart shows the five donors that have allocated the most bilateral aid to Ukraine across sectors between Jan. 24, 2022 to Dec. 31, 2024. PRESSURE ON EUROPE The pause in U.S. military aid puts more pressure on European allies who have publicly embraced Zelenskiy since the Oval Office blow-up. Britain and France, whose leaders both visited the White House last week, have offered troops to help guard a potential ceasefire. On Tuesday, Germany's conservatives and Social Democrats announced proposals to set up a 500 billion euro ($531 billion) fund to help ramp up defence spending. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen unveiled proposals to mobilise up to 800 billion euros for EU defence spending. The 27-nation bloc holds an emergency summit on Thursday. French President Emmanuel Macron's office said the president had spoken with both the U.S. and Ukrainian leaders and welcomed Zelenskiy's will to re-engage with Trump. But French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou was sharply critical of Trump's move to pause military supplies. ""Suspending aid during a war to a country under attack means abandoning the country under attack and accepting or hoping that the aggressor will win,"" he said during a parliamentary debate.

The War of Words Over Medicaid Cuts,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-03-04-0459/facts-and-fact-checking-war-words-over-medicaid-cuts,FactCheck.org,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/factcheckorg-media-bias,Lean Left,https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/the-war-of-words-over-medicaid-cuts/,"Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino.

Democrats and Republicans are accusing one another of “lying” about what a House Republican budget resolution means for Medicaid, and both sides have made misleading or speculative comments. There’s little doubt the health care program would face cuts under the plan — and it would have to if Medicare cuts are off limits.

Democrats have seized on the resolution’s call for the Energy and Commerce Committee to cut $880 billion in spending over 10 years. The committee’s options for those reductions are almost entirely in spending for Medicaid, a federal-state program that provides health care for low-income people, and Medicare, the federal program that covers seniors.

Republicans have said the legislation doesn’t pinpoint any specific changes to Medicaid, which is correct but sidesteps the reality that the bulk of the spending cuts would likely be to that program. Democrats, meanwhile, have speculated that hospitals and nursing homes will close, impacts that aren’t known without details of how federal spending will be trimmed and how states will react.

The resolution that narrowly passed the House on Feb. 25 along party lines has several legislative hurdles to overcome before any spending cuts materialize. Most notably, it still needs to pass the Senate, where some Republicans want to change the legislation. The budget resolution is the first step to Congress using a maneuver called reconciliation to extend the 2017 tax cuts, most of which are set to expire at the end of this year. Reconciliation enables a tax and spending bill to pass the Senate with a simple majority, rather than 60 votes.

The House resolution lays out the broad parameters of extending the 2017 tax cut provisions and enacting some new cuts, at a cost of $4.5 trillion over 10 years, and reducing government spending by $2 trillion over the same time period. Both houses of Congress need to agree on this or another budget framework before lawmakers can then propose legislation on the specific ways they would cut and spend their way to those figures. (See slide 11 here for a flowchart on the process from the Committee on a Responsible Federal Budget.)

We’ll go through several claims about the resolution.

Size of Medicaid Cuts

Lawmakers have made conflicting statements about how much would need to be cut from Medicaid under the House resolution.

Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar, Feb. 25 press conference: Now some of our friends on the other side of the aisle will say, “This is just a procedural step. Please don’t hold this vote against me.” Here’s the truth: This vote doesn’t just open the door for Medicaid cuts, it guarantees them.

Republican Rep. Steve Scalise, Feb. 25 press conference: The word Medicaid is not even in this bill. This bill doesn’t even mention the word Medicaid a single time. And yet, all Democrats are doing is lying about what’s in the budget because they don’t want to talk about the truth of what we’re voting to start.

As we said, the Senate would still need to pass the resolution, and lawmakers then would need to agree on the specific spending cuts. But Aguilar has a point that the $880 billion would have to touch Medicaid, unless lawmakers wanted to find the reductions in Medicare — which may be even more politically challenging. Plus, House Republicans already have talked about some options for Medicaid cuts, such as adding work requirements and finding efficiencies in the program.

Scalise is correct in saying the legislation doesn’t include the word “Medicaid.” But, again, there’s little doubt that the program would face spending reductions — and they could be substantial, as we’ll explain.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan budget watchdog group, said in a Feb. 20 post that “it would likely be nearly impossible to meet the [$880 billion] target without including some Medicaid reductions.”

Democratic Rep. Brendan Boyle, Feb. 25 press conference: If Energy and Commerce Committee said, “We don’t want to cut Medicaid, instead we will cut literally everything else we possibly can 100%,” that only gets you about halfway to the $880 billion. So, by definition, they have to, as a minimum, cut hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicaid.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Feb. 27 press conference: Republicans are lying to the American people about Medicaid. The Republican budget authorizes up to $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid by directing the Energy and Commerce Committee to find those spending cuts. Everybody knows who has had any connection to the congressional budget that if you are directing the Energy and Commerce Committee to find up to $880 billion, if not more, in spending cuts, that means Medicaid.

All $880 billion over 10 years doesn’t have to come out of Medicaid, as Jeffries suggested in a Feb. 27 news conference, but Boyle is correct that there’s no way to get around sizable cuts to Medicaid — unless, again, lawmakers turn to cutting Medicare.

On Jan. 27, President Donald Trump said he would again “pledge,” as he did repeatedly during the campaign: “I will not sign any bill that cuts even a single penny from Medicare or Social Security for our great seniors.” He has said similar things about Medicaid, though he has left open the possibility of cutting waste or “fraud” from all three programs.

Robin Rudowitz, a vice president and director for the program on Medicaid and the uninsured at KFF, a health policy research group, told us that “the large majority” of the $880 billion “is likely to come out of Medicaid,” and if Medicare cuts are off the table, there’s “no other way to get to that magnitude of savings” without Medicaid cuts.

CJ Young, a spokesperson for the Democrats on the Energy and Commerce Committee told us: “Of the funding that’s available for the Committee to cut, approximately 98% percent of that is either Medicare or Medicaid funding. So if you take Trump at his word that he’s not touching Medicare, then the vast majority of the cuts will have to come out of the safety net health care program.”

We asked a spokesperson for the Republicans on the committee about this, but we haven’t received a response.

In breaking down the numbers of what the Energy and Commerce Committee can trim, the New York Times said that if the committee eliminates all non-health care spending, “it will still be more than $600 billion short” of that $880 billion target.

“The reality is that this 880 number is targeting Energy and Commerce, and the place where they have the ability to make cuts is going to be in Medicaid,” Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, told us.

Medicaid is jointly funded by the states and the federal government; the federal share over the next 10 years is estimated at $8.2 trillion. So, it would be about an 11% cut if all $880 billion came out of Medicaid.

Medicare spending over 10 years is even higher — approximately $15.8 trillion, according to this New York Times analysis. The Energy and Commerce Committee oversees about another $600 billion that it could trim, including money for the Children’s Health Insurance Program.

If this budget resolution moves forward, the committee would have to find the entire $880 billion in deficit reduction, Chris Towner, CRFB’s policy director, told us in an email. “If push comes to shove and lawmakers don’t think they can meet those instructions, they would need to amend the budget resolution,” he said.

Impact of Potential Cuts

Democrats have claimed that hospitals would close and people would lose health coverage, while Republicans have said any cuts would be to waste, fraud and abuse. Without the specifics on spending reductions, the impacts aren’t known, but experts told us that large cuts in federal funding would leave states with budget gaps and tough choices on what to do about them.

Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone, Feb. 25, CNBC: Well, I think the problem is that the Republican leadership is lying to the rank and file Republicans. In other words, they know that these Medicaid cuts will really take away health care from so many people and close hospitals and close nursing homes.

Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu, Feb. 25 press conference: And what does $880 billion of Medicaid look like? It means the shutting down of community health clinics, the shutting down of hospitals, the shutting down of nursing homes.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, Feb. 27, CNN: We’re going to take care of those who are rightful beneficiaries of the programs. We’re going to cut the fraud, waste and abuse out of Medicaid, and that’s where we’re going to get part of the savings to accomplish this mission. … There’s about $50 billion estimated that are lost every year in Medicaid just in fraud alone.

Trump, Feb. 26, Cabinet meeting: We’re not going to touch it [Medicaid, Medicare or Social Security]. Now, we are going to look for fraud. I’m sure you’re OK with that, like people that shouldn’t be on, people that are illegal aliens and others, criminals in many cases.

Medicaid is funded jointly by states and the federal government, which provides matching funds of at least 50%, as KFF explains. An expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act provides a match of 90% in federal funding. About 21% of the U.S. population, or 83 million people, have Medicaid coverage, including those with low income and disabilities, as well as seniors. Medicaid, not Medicare, covers long-term care expenses for the elderly.

Rudowitz at KFF told us that changes the federal government makes to Medicaid financing “really gets transferred to the states,” which then “have to figure out how they’re going to respond to those cuts.” She said states could raise revenue, make cuts to other parts of their budgets or cut their Medicaid programs — and the latter option could mean cutting coverage or benefits, or the payment rates to health care providers. “All states might respond differently,” she said.

She noted that while most of Medicaid’s enrollees are children and adults, most of the spending is for people with disabilities and seniors, because of their high health care costs.

Cuello at Georgetown told us an $880 billion cut is “gigantic” and “orders of magnitude too large to not be destructive.” He, too, said that the “final cuts might be made by states.”

“So in other words, you might reduce state funding by some gigantic number, and then the state has to react to that, and we can’t predict, we can’t tell you exactly what they’re going to do,” Cuello said.

We asked if he thought the potential impact would be as severe as community health centers, hospitals or nursing homes closing, as Democrats have claimed. “Yes, I do,” he said. “I don’t think we can predict that that is going to happen exactly in every state. Those things are the downstream consequences.”

Cuello noted that rural hospital closure is already a problem. “And if you defund the system … there are going to be hospitals that go over the brink,” he said.

In a Feb. 20 post, CRFB identified what it called “state financing gimmicks” that it said could be changed or eliminated to save federal dollars. It said that “incremental policy changes could improve the integrity of the Medicaid program and prevent states from unfairly gaming Medicaid’s financing laws while also leading to savings.” One example is lowering or banning Medicaid provider taxes, which are now capped at 6%.

“As we have discussed, states often tax providers up to 6 percent of providers’ revenue and then use those funds to remit payments back to providers, reporting the payments to the federal government in the process to collect matching funds,” which “essentially” boosts the Medicaid match, CRFB said. It estimated savings of $240 billion to $610 billion over a decade if provider taxes were restricted or eliminated, respectively.

Towner told us his organization’s post showed that “finding Medicaid savings also does not necessarily mean slashing Medicaid or even benefits – there are lots of non-benefit savings options available that could be used to fulfill this savings.”

Rudowitz and Cuello, however, said that a reduction in provider taxes would still leave states with a budget gap for their Medicaid programs. Some could argue that there should be more transparency and restrictions on provider taxes, Rudowitz said, but on the other side, “there are tradeoffs and consequences” to states getting less in federal matching funds.

As for Johnson’s and Trump’s claims about finding fraud, that’s unlikely to result in a sizable amount of savings — and certainly not $880 billion, these experts said. Johnson referred to $50 billion in fraud in Medicaid each year, but the Government Accountability Office estimated that amount for “improper payments” in fiscal year 2023 not solely “fraud.”

The GAO said that improper payments include overpayments and underpayments or payments that shouldn’t have been made. That can include fraud, “but not all improper payments are the result of fraud,” the report said. It didn’t give an estimate for fraud, saying that “estimates of improper payments cannot be used to determine the extent of fraud in a particular program.”

Johnson’s office hasn’t responded to our inquiry about his claim.

Often improper payments are missing some documents or paperwork, Rudowitz and Cuello said, and it doesn’t necessarily mean the payment shouldn’t have been made.

Andy Schneider, also a research professor at Georgetown’s McCourt School of Public Policy, wrote a January blog post about Medicaid fraud. He said that fraud does occur — mostly on the part of unscrupulous providers, who, when caught, are charged with crimes. But there isn’t a good estimate of how much fraud there might be.

The Department of Health and Human Services also provides estimates on improper payments and recommendations on how to reduce them, Schneider explained. HHS’ fiscal year 2024 report estimated Medicaid’s improper payment rate at 5.09%, or $31.1 billion for the year. Of this amount, 74.3% was classified as improper due to “insufficient documentation.” The report said: “The insufficient documentation errors include claims where information was missing, or states did not follow appropriate processes to determine if a payment was proper or improper.”

As Schneider said, “had the information been available, the claim may have been payable (or not).”

In his interview on CNN on Feb. 27, Johnson said adding work requirements was one possibility for cutting Medicaid spending (which would save about $100 billion over 10 years, according to the Times). But a per-capita cap on funding or reducing the federal match (measures that would save hundreds of billions more) weren’t being considered, he said.

“Look, everybody needs to watch the process play out,” Johnson said. “It’s going to take us five or six weeks, probably, to dig through all those details and come up with the final proposal.”",Center,False

Democrats Are Serious About a Shutdown,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-03-04-0455/politics-democrats-are-serious-about-shutdown,Politico,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/politico-media-bias,Lean Left,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/03/04/house-democrats-shutdown-doge-00205584,"This time, it’s Democrats who are itching for a fight — over the Department of Government Efficiency cuts that Trump has blessed and deputized mogul Elon Musk has gleefully carried out.

Senior House Democrats have spent recent days privately surveying their members about whether they’d be willing to shut the government down over DOGE cuts, according to multiple well-placed Democratic sources I spoke to over the weekend.

So far, they’re encountering little resistance.

Democrats of all persuasions, even some centrists who have long been firmly anti-shutdown, feel that voting for a “clean” spending bill would be tacitly blessing Musk’s controversial work. Denying Republicans the votes they’ll need to keep the agencies open, they believe, would be the lesser evil.

“Nobody wants a shutdown, but they don’t feel like aiding and abetting what’s happening, with Musk and Trump taking a wrecking ball to health care in particular,” said one senior House Democratic aide, who like others I spoke to was granted anonymity to speak candidly about internal party conversations. “Why would we be complicit in that?”

A senior Democratic lawmaker was blunter: “At some point you’ve got to have a goddamn backbone. I am not giving them a blank check until September.”

That’s a big pivot from just a few weeks ago. In early February, I pooh-poohed the left’s push to use the March 14 government funding deadline to make a stand against Musk — and then heard from a number of senior Democratic officials on both sides of the Capitol who privately agreed with my assessment.

A Democrat-induced shutdown, they agreed, would backfire on their party politically and only empower Musk even more to slash and burn his way through federal agencies. And they were frustrated with the base for not seeming to understand that playing with fire wasn’t the answer.

Now, with the funding deadline less than two weeks away?

“People now feel like the more perilous position is giving votes without the perception there’s been any change in accountability,” a second senior House Democratic aide told me. “The incentive structure right now is not to provide votes for them.”

Sure, you can chalk some of the shift up to negotiating tactics. Democrats want Republicans to put some policy handcuffs on Musk, something Republicans are firmly rejecting. House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole called it “a non-starter and battle they lost to the American people” on Monday.

And Democratic leaders have every reason to amp up pressure on their GOP counterparts to deliver as many votes as possible, given their control of the House, Senate and White House. No reason to make it easy on them, even if there’s no real shutdown threat, right?

But that’s not how House Democrats are talking, even in private. During a recent meeting between Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and his committee leaders, top appropriator Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut steamed about how Speaker Mike Johnson was going to try to make them swallow the clean funding extension.

“No fucking way!” she shouted, a person in the room told me. Jeffries didn’t push back, and now his leadership team is gauging whether his members are willing to take this fight all the way.

Usually shutdown saber-rattling originates on the fringes of the two parties and gains momentum until leaders just can’t ignore it, lest they risk their own jobs. This time, however, the foment is coming from the leadership table itself — where there is growing anger over the lightning-fast Trump-Musk campaign to gut federal agencies and the glacial pace of court action to stop it.

Some senior House Democrats believe the impacts of the DOGE cuts have already created a shutdown of sorts and that passing a clean funding extension would effectively green-light the status quo and potentially undercut pending court cases challenging Trump and Musk.

Moreover, I am told, Democrats have been emboldened by recent polling showing that the public has started to shift against DOGE, as Americans hear more about potentially losing benefits and veterans getting kicked out of jobs. That’s to say nothing of the recent town-hall protests, where Republican lawmakers took an earful from constituents raging against DOGE.

Perhaps most importantly, Democrats up and down the leadership chain are hearing not only from the liberal base but people they consider more mainstream — donors, strategists and constituents who believe they need to show some fight, and fast.

“It’s very hard to go back to those people and say, ‘Yeah, I voted for the status quo here and did nothing to stand up,’” the second House Democratic aide said.

What might be even harder for House Democrats, though, is figuring out an endgame.

Say Democrats vote against a clean spending bill in the House and allow a shutdown to occur: Musk might have dismissed tens of thousands of federal workers, but Uncle Sam still employs more than 2 million more who would be furloughed without pay.

Amid the finger-pointing, Republicans would call vote after vote to reopen government agencies — casting Democrats as the ones who are repeatedly choosing to keep agencies shut and employees home without paychecks.

That’s tough terrain to fight from, politically speaking, and especially tough when you consider how a shutdown might undercut Democrats’ core message right now — that Trump and Musk are undercutting the services and benefits that millions of Americans rely on.

Right now, senior party leaders are posturing, trying to cast Republicans as the unreasonable ones. “The only one who wants a shutdown right now is Elon Musk,” Senate Appropriations Vice Chair Patty Murray of Washington said Monday, calling for a “short-term” stopgap instead of the six-month bill Trump and Johnson want.

Jeffries over the weekend accused GOP leaders of “walking away” from funding talks, arguing that it’s on the GOP alone to fund the government since they control everything.

Top Democrats know as well as anyone that’s not exactly true: Appropriations has to be bipartisan given the 60-vote threshold in the Senate, which is the leverage they have long used to counter Republicans’ proposed spending cuts. And that argument isn’t the kind of resonant message that’s capable of ultimately winning over the public.

But it turns out Democrats might have learned a lesson from the most recent GOP-instigated shutdowns — the multi-week affairs seen in 2013 and 2019 waged over health care and border policy, respectively: Winning isn’t always the point — sometimes, when dealing with an angry base, you just have to tilt at the windmill.",Left,False

The FBI director has promised to overturn all rocks relating to the Epstein files essentially. He must since last week’s document dump was a two-jab punch to the gut: both releases—the morning and late afternoon—were files already made public through past media reports or files disclosed during the trial of Epstein’s top lieutenant, Ghislaine Maxwell. It was a total dud.

Bondi said her office reportedly found the documents last Friday around 8 AM. Director Patel will have a detailed report on why these files weren’t initially disclosed. The attorney general said they were stored in the Southern District of New York. She wants a full report on why they were withheld since the Biden administration knew these documents existed and sat on them. We can probably answer why there was extreme slow-walking—all the Democrats’ top allies and friends are probably in these files.

Ms. Bondi reaffirmed the Justice Department’s commitment to transparency and honesty. The people have the right to know.

There will be a redaction process, and Ms. Maxwell is appealing her case to the Supreme Court. It could take a while, but there were rumblings that something was off last Thursday, regarding why we were offered a whole lot of nothing. It was the motherlode of retreads.

It is a surprise reversal for Robert Crimo III, who previously pleaded not guilty to first degree murder and attempted murder charges.

Crimo, 23, entered his guilty plea on Monday moments before opening arguments were due to begin in his trial.

He is accused of shooting at celebrating crowds from a roof in downtown Highland Park, about 30 miles (50 kilometres) north of Chicago.

Authorities had arrested him on the day of the shooting after a manhunt.

Crimo pleaded guilty before Judge Victoria Rossetti in a Lake County circuit courtroom, and did not say anything else before he was dismissed.

According to the Chicago Tribune, the suspect's mother briefly interrupted after he pleaded guilty, resulting in the judge warning her that she could be kicked out of the courtroom.

His trial was expected to last a month, with testimony from survivors and police.

Crimo faces seven murder counts and a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole.

He is due to be sentenced on 23 April.

Prosecutors said they also turned over thousands of pages of evidence, including a videotaped interrogation during which police say the suspect had confessed to the shooting.

The victims killed in the shooting were Katherine Goldstein, 64; Jacquelyn Sundheim, 63; Stephen Straus, 88; Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza, 78; Eduardo Uvaldo, 69; and married couple Kevin McCarthy, 37, and Irina McCarthy, 35.

More than 40 others were injured, with victims ages ranging from their 80s to an eight-year-old boy who was left paralysed.

Prosecutors during the trial said Crimo had disguised himself in women's clothing before he accessed a rooftop and opened fire on parade-goers.

He then left the area, dropping his semi-automatic weapon.

Authorities said Crimo had driven for more than two hours to Wisconsin after the shooting before he was caught by police.

Police recovered 83 spent shell casings, as well as rifle magazines, from the scene of the shooting.",Center,True

The Dow tumbled 650 points, or 1.48%, to close at 43,191. The Dow fell almost 900 points in afternoon trading before pulling back slightly. The broader S&P 500 fell 1.76% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.64%.

The S&P 500 posted its biggest one-day decline of the year. The Nasdaq is down about 6.5% since since Trump took office on January 20.

“Tomorrow, tariffs — 25% on Canada and 25% on Mexico,” Trump said during a press conference at the White House. “And that’ll start. … What they have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United States, in which case they have no tariffs.”

Trump said the two trading partners had “no room” left to negotiate to avoid the levies and that he was using tariffs to “punish” countries that, as he put it, were taking from the US economy without giving enough in return.

“They’re all set. They go into effect tomorrow,” he said.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Ottawa would immediately respond with tariffs on $30 billion of US goods if the Trump administration’s measures go into effect.

“Canada will not let this unjustified decision go unanswered,” he said in a statement.

Trump also signed an executive order on Monday raising tariffs on imports from China to 20%, up from 10%. Trump said the tariffs, aimed at bringing China to the table on curtailing fentanyl entering the United States, will be raised because Beijing has not done enough to stem the flow of illegal drugs.

The VIX, Wall Street’s fear gauge, surged to its highest point this year after Trump’s comments.

“Due to the uncertainty surrounding the tariffs, the stock market has erased the gains from the ‘Trump bump’ following the presidential election and the expected upward pressure on prices is giving investors pause,” said Gustavo Flores-Macias, a professor of government and public policy at Cornell University.

“For investors, 2025 can still be a positive year for stocks, but it may take all year to realize gains. And they may be modest,” said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group.

“I’m still a bull,” Bolvin said.

The import taxes Trump imposed are significant — the largest in US-China history. The initial tariffs, which went into effect February 4, set in motion tariffs on $1.4 trillion of imported goods. That’s more than triple the $380 billion worth of foreign goods that were hit with tariffs during Trump’s first term, according to estimates from the Tax Foundation.

Chinese response

A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce said Tuesday the country was “strongly dissatisfied” and “firmly opposed” the additional tariff.

“(China) will take countermeasures to firmly safeguard its own rights and interests,” the spokesperson added in a statement.

Before he became president, Trump pledged a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods, so the tariff level could rise still.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said at the press conference about tariffs on Canada and Mexico that global companies can avoid tariffs if they invest into production in the United States, like TSMC, the Taiwanese chipmaker at the White House on Monday to announce a $100 billion US investment.

Trump’s tariffs will raise prices of imported goods, which could boost demand for goods produced in the US, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs. But they also noted that tariffs will have negative effects on some American businesses.

“Tariff increases will also raise production costs for some domestic producers and will likely prompt foreign retaliation against some US exports, both of which could hurt domestic production,” they wrote in a note.

US stocks are “likely to be volatile” until Trump’s policies point toward being more growth-focused, said Jason Draho, head of asset allocation for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note Monday.

Draho said he does expect future growth and maintains a “positive medium-term outlook.”

‘Extreme fear’

The stock market began to slide Monday morning to begin the new month, as investors digested the latest manufacturing survey from the Institute for Supply Management. The survey showed economic activity in the manufacturing industry remained in expansion territory, yet slowed last month. Tariff fears dominated write-in responses to the survey.

Markets slid Monday afternoon after Trump posted on Truth Social that he plans to implement tariffs on “external product[s],” potentially including agricultural products. Trump’s post referred to his plan for reciprocal tariffs, set to take place on April 2, according to a person familiar, though it was not immediately clear how these tariffs would be implemented.

“To the Great Farmers of the United States: Get ready to start making a lot of agricultural product to be sold INSIDE of the United States. Tariffs will go on external product on April 2nd. Have fun!” Trump said in the post.

The sentiment driving markets on Monday dipped into “extreme fear” after Trump’s confirmation that tariffs will go into effect on Tuesday, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed Index.

The stocks dragging markets lower on Monday included Nvidia (NVDA), which fell 8.7%.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury slid to 4.16%, signaling concerns about uncertainty and future economic growth.

Bitcoin traded around $85,600 on Monday afternoon, down 8.6% in the past day and largely erasing gains made after Trump on Sunday announced a strategic crypto reserve that would include bitcoin.

What If I Told You There Was No Epstein List?,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-03-03-1303/criminal-justice-what-if-i-told-you-there-was-no-epstein-list,ZeroHedge,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/zerohedge-media-bias,Lean Right,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2025-03-02/what-if-i-told-you-there-was-no-epstein-list,"Authored by Nick Bryant

We’ve been bombarded by rumors of the Epstein List, which is thought to be the Holy Grail of the Epstein case. On Wednesday, March 26, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced on national television that the “Epstein files” were on her desk, and she was releasing them to the public the following day. She also declared that the “files” contained “a lot of flight logs” and “a lot of names.”

Unfortunately, Bondi’s declaration was much ado about nothing. So, either she lied on national television, or she didn’t look at the documents on her desk before releasing them. In either case, her behavior was egregious.

I uploaded Epstein’s Black Book to the internet in 2015, and I believe that’s the closest we’ve come to an Epstein List, because the Black Book contains the names of numerous perps. I also uploaded passenger manifests from Epstein’s various sojourns, which, I believe, contain the names of various perpetrators, too. The documentation I released in 2015 had exponentially more information on the particulars of Epstein case than the redacted dreck Bondi released on Thursday.

In the ""Epstein List"" or ""Epstein Files"" narrative, each acts like Epstein kept a list of his child molesting clients as if were a travel agent at the Jeffrey Epstein Travel Agency. The Epstein list narrative is problematic because the idea he just kept their names and numbers in his black book at best the Epstein list is wishful thinking, at worst it's a contrived meme.

According to a New York Times Article from July 8th, 2018, federal authorities seized hundreds, possibly thousands, of sexually suggestive photographs of girls who appear underage as well as hand-labeled compact discs with titles like ""girls pics nude"" and with the namess redacted like ""young [redacted] plus [redacted]"". Judging by the titles on the discs Epstein was a purveyor of child rap material. The latter disc named by the New York Times is perhaps an indication of blackmail.

A New York Times article from August 29th, 2019 names Ghislaine Maxwell, Sarah Kellen Leslie Groff, Adriana Ross Nadia Marcinkova, and Haley Robson as procurers or otherwise pimps for the Epstein criminal enterprise. The case that put Maxwell in prison was truly a travesty of Justice. Two of her indictments consisted of conspiracy to entice miners to travel and engage in illegal sex acts and also conspiracy to transport minors with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity. Though Maxwell was indicted on two conspiracies none of her criminal cohorts were indicted, which makes absolutely no sense.",Lean Right,True

America’s Cultural Revolution,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-03-03-1255/culture-america-s-cultural-revolution,The Atlantic,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/atlantic,Left,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/trump-america-cultural-revolution/681863/,"The takeover of the Kennedy Center may seem like an afterthought in the furious drama of President Donald Trump’s first month in office. The abandonment of the transatlantic alliance, proposals to annex territory on multiple continents, the evisceration of national institutions, and overt claims to kingship are such eye-popping departures from precedent that the leadership of a somewhat stuffy, self-consciously elite performing-arts venue seems negligible by comparison. But Trump’s peculiar preoccupation with the Kennedy Center is symptomatic of a profound change in the nature of American power since his inauguration: America is undergoing a cultural revolution. “This is going to be great television,” Trump said at the end of Friday’s stormy session with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. It may as well be the motto of his administration.

It is a new kind of cultural revolution. Unlike the totalitarian regimes of the 20th century, which imposed ideology on their populaces by means of culture and entertainment, America’s current reality is the overturning of the political order by the country’s entertainers. The American culture industry has overwhelmed politics: Washington today can be understood only as a product of show business, not of law or policy.

The Trump administration has been consistent in its veneration of show business, if in nothing else. The president has put a WWE executive in charge of education, made a Fox News talking head his secretary of defense, installed a celebrity conspiracy theorist to lead the National Institutes of Health, handed control of Medicare to a TV doctor, and appointed a right-wing podcaster as deputy director of the FBI. Elon Musk is running government reform because he can live-post it. Dr. Phil accompanies ICE on raids. Trump’s Cabinet picks resemble the cast of a reality-television show by design: Trump understands, by instinct and through experience, that the line between entertainment and power in American life has effectively dissolved.

In his farewell address, President Joe Biden described the incoming administration as an oligarchy. He was mistaken. It is rule by performers: a “histriocracy.” Anyone who wants to understand what is happening in American politics needs to understand it on those terms.

In 2016, a reality-TV star’s rise to the presidency was novel, and seeing that surprise triumph as an anomaly was still possible. No longer. The 2024 election was not just evidence of a rightward shift among traditionally Democratic voters, or of rising anti-government patriotism, but a clarification of how fundamentally American politics has shifted the ground from which its meaning derives.

Politics has become an offshoot of spectacle. Trump has left intellectuals grasping for historical analogies: Is he a fascist or a populist? Is he a latter-day Know Nothing or a modern demagogue? The analogies are unsatisfying because they fail to account for popular culture as a political force, the way it has scrambled traditional dividing lines. Trump has Orthodox Jewish grandchildren and is a hero to the white-power movement. He won a record percentage of Arab American votes, then appointed an ambassador to Israel who claims that “there is no such thing as Palestinians.” He enjoys fervent support among evangelicals despite the fact that his character is a living contradiction of every value they revere. These paradoxes would not be possible in a politics that selects the country’s leadership on the basis of ideas and character. They make sense if brute exposure determines who wins.

As the grand soap opera of this American presidency unfolds, displays of rage and wonder fill every moment: get-rich-quick schemes, rigged games, vengeful punishments. The audience is hurried from one hustle to another. The distinction between a con and a joke has blurred. The great circus showman P. T. Barnum prophesied the rise of Trump when he declared: “Let me furnish the amusements of a nation and there will be need of very few laws.” The connection between Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and John F. Kennedy is more than genetic. Norman Mailer, in his famous essay on the 1960 Democratic Convention, “Superman Comes to the Supermarket,” noticed a mysterious sadness that gripped the spectators, which made sense only when he saw the future President Kennedy in the flesh: “The Democrats were going to nominate a man who, no matter how serious his political dedication might be, was indisputably and willy-nilly going to be seen as a great box-office actor, and the consequences of that were staggering and not at all easy to calculate.” Trump’s Cabinet is the staggering consequence that Mailer could not calculate.

Ronald Reagan in the 1980s made the connection between celebrity and power even more explicit; he rose after a career in which perhaps his most famous role was starring opposite a chimpanzee. The “Great Communicator” told corny jokes and knew that television was everything. The Republican Party “won one for the Gipper,” as Reagan’s campaign slogan had it. When his administration abolished the Fairness Doctrine in 1987, releasing news media from any obligation of impartiality, it prepared the way for histriocracy without government interference.

Rule by performers is distinct from autocracy. The ruling performers serve the narrative needs of their fans first and foremost. Policy will always be an addendum to the show. The overturning of Roe v. Wade had compelling emotional heft for Trump’s base, a soul-stirring final scene to the movie that had been playing in their minds for generations: “We beat the cosmopolitan elite to save babies.” The happy ending was that abortion became illegal in much of the United States.

But winning for show is very different from having a desired effect on the world. Since 2018, the rate of abortions has, by most accounts, kept rising—not that anybody seems to care, because the narrative impulse is the primary political driver. In fact, the restrictionist policy’s failure provides an opportunity for endless sequels. Trump has served the pro-life movement’s storyline needs by creating the conditions for an increase in abortion numbers: so many more bad people to punish, so many more babies who need saving. In a politics determined by performance, outcomes are epilogues that nobody reads.

The reality of rule by performers is profoundly disconcerting to American intellectuals’ self-conception of their government’s dignity. This is the message of the Kennedy Center’s takeover that the D.C. political elite has been so slow to register. If you think it’s a joke to have RFK Jr. in office, that’s the point. Jokes gather attention. Attention creates exposure. Exposure drives power. The greatest asset for any politician today is a bottomless narcissism that requires unremitting attention to satisfy.

Rule by performers doesn’t need to impose an autocrat’s lies on the people; people do it to themselves through their entertainments. In 1984, George Orwell described doublethink as the kind of intellectual gymnastics demanded by a totalitarian society: “To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies.” Reality television and the WWE demand similar distortion-effect gymnastics; their audiences willingly suspend their disbelief and gladly accept events they know are artificial as real. The audiences come to political debate already prepared for the blurring of illusion and reality. “The public appears disposed to be amused even when they are conscious of being deceived,” Barnum understood, which is why they called him the “Prince of Humbugs.” In Trump, they have a king.",Left,True
Trump announces $100 billion investment by Taiwan semiconductor manufacturer,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-03-03-1252/economy-and-jobs-trump-announces-100-billion-investment-taiwan-semiconductor,Washington Times,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/washington-times-bias,Lean Right,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/mar/3/donald-trump-announces-100-billion-investment-taiwan-semiconductor/,"President Trump announced Monday that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. plans to spend $100 billion on new manufacturing plants in Arizona.

TSMC is the world’s biggest semiconductor manufacturer. Companies such as Apple and Intel use its chips in computers, smartphones, cars and medical equipment.

“This will create hundreds of billions of dollars in economic activity and boost America’s dominance in artificial intelligence and beyond,” Mr. Trump said. “Semiconductors are the backbone of the 21st-century economy, and really, without the semiconductors, there is no economy.”

The money will go toward five facilities in Arizona, which Mr. Trump said will create 20,000 to 25,000 jobs.

“The most powerful AI chips in the world will be made right here in America,” he said.

The president called the move “a matter of economic security, it’s also a matter of national security.”

“We must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here in American factories with American skill and American labor,” he said. “That’s exactly what we’re doing.”

C.C. Wei, the CEO of TSMC, said he was “happy” to announce the $100 billion investment and thanked Mr. Trump for his support.

“It’s going to create thousands of high-paying jobs,” Mr. Wei said.

TSMC chips manufactured in the U.S. will not be subject to tariffs.

Mr. Trump said these and other new factories will increase the U.S. manufacturing share to close to 40% of the chips in the global market.

TSMC benefited from President Biden’s CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which promised $6.6 billion in funding. The company spent more than $65 billion to build three facilities in Arizona, and the first started producing 4-nanometer chips late last year.

Mr. Trump has threatened up to 100% tariffs on semiconductor chip imports if production isn’t moved to the U.S.

He has bashed the CHIPS Act for giving money to a company that already had plenty. He has also raised concerns about Taiwan’s dominance in the industry.

“They left us and went to Taiwan,” Mr. Trump told congressional Republicans in January. “And we don’t want to give them billions of dollars like this ridiculous program that Biden has given everybody billions of dollars. They already have billions of dollars. They’ve got nothing but money. … They didn’t need money. They needed an incentive. And the incentive is going to be they’re not going to want to pay a 25, 50 or even a 100% tax.”

Critics of the Taiwan-based company say it has a monopoly on the worldwide microchip market. More than 90% of the most advanced chips come out of the island, which is the target of constant invasion threats by China.

Analysts see risks to TSMC operating only out of Taiwan, as it has largely done to date.

Attacks on the island leading to destroyed facilities could leave America shorthanded, putting at risk some of the country’s most important technology and affecting the U.S. military. The company has some facilities in mainland China, which could be susceptible to hacking and sabotage.

Lawmakers and other officials have suggested that TSMC’s fabrication plants should be destroyed to prevent them from falling into China’s hands if the communist power follows through with its threat to take over Taiwan, which it views as a renegade province.

The notion was criticized because the absence of production on Taiwan, regardless of political control, would badly damage economies worldwide.

The TSMC announcement is just one of several investment announcements Mr. Trump has made since he took office.

The heads of OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank plan to spend up to $500 billion in artificial intelligence infrastructure. DAMAC Properties said it will spend $20 billion to build data centers.

Apple CEO Tim Cook has announced plans to invest $500 billion in the U.S. and move manufacturing plants from Mexico to the U.S.

Honda announced Monday that it will produce its next-generation Civic hybrid in the U.S. instead of Mexico to avoid any tariffs.",Lean Right,True
How can Americans act together when we don’t think alike?

“It gives us different mechanisms and institutions for dealing with each other when we disagree, and therefore for turning difference and disagreement into something constructive,” added Levin, a former George W. Bush administration official.

Answering questions as part of a Deseret News “Yellow Couch” interview, titled “Yuval Levin — the Constitution and coalition-building,” Levin said it is very hard to understand American character without thinking about the Constitution.

”The way in which we understand our relationships to one another, the way we think about other citizens, has a lot to do with how we understand our rights, how we understand our obligations, how we understand the institutions. And so, in a way, to think about the Constitution really is to think about America and to think about the possibilities we have for resolving problems in a very diverse and often very divided country.”

In this Deseret News video, Lavin also speaks about unity, coalition building, hope, optimism and presidential power.

”What I try to do is help people see how the Constitution is built to be an answer to a basic question that we have to ask ourselves, ‘How can we as Americans act together when we don’t think alike? How can we solve problems while we disagree?' I think in a lot of ways, the Constitution is an answer to that question.”",Center,True
What we know about claims 70 Christians were beheaded in Democratic Republic of Congo,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-03-03-1249/religion-and-faith-what-we-know-about-claims-70-christians-were-beheaded,Snopes,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/snopes,Lean Left,https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/02/24/congo-70-christians-beheaded/,"In February 2025, claims (archived) circulated on social media and news outlets including Fox News and Newsweek that 70 Christians were beheaded in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Media reports and posts (archived) on X (archived), Facebook and Instagram (archived) said the bodies of the victims were found in a church in Kasanga after the victims were kidnapped from Mayeba, both villages in North Kivu province in the country's northeast.

Reports from two religious persecution awareness groups claimed attackers beheaded some or all of the bodies.

Several reports accused the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in the Democratic Republic of Congo, also known as the Allied Democratic Forces, of carrying out the attack. The ADF is an armed group designated by the United States as a terrorist organization.

Some Snopes readers asked whether the reported killings happened in Congo without specifying which of the two nations bearing this name — the Republic of Congo, formerly a French territory, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly a Belgian territory — they were referring to. The two are separate countries bordering the Congo River.

Though the story that 70 Christians were beheaded in the DRC was widely reported in local media, it was not possible to independently verify the claims.

Local media reports featured varying dates for the kidnapping and killing of the alleged victims. Though some stories featured named sources, it was difficult to adequately back up the sources' credentials. Open Doors UK, a charity raising awareness of the prosecution of Christians, told Snopes it was ""100% confident"" that the reported attack occurred. Meanwhile, MONUSCO, the United Nations peacekeeping mission in the DRC, said in a Feb. 24 statement that the reports ""remain unverified."" The International Committee of the Red Cross in the DRC declined to confirm or deny the claims.

In a statement, MONUSCO said (emphasis ours):

MONUSCO acknowledges the serious allegations received from a civil society source regarding the reported discovery of over 70 bodies, including those of women, children, and elderly individuals, found on 15 February in a church building in Maiba village, Lubero Territory, North Kivu. According to these initial claims, the victims were allegedly tied up and decapitated, possibly killed with bladed weapons by unidentified armed elements men.

At this stage, however, it is important to clarify that these reports remain unverified. Our colleagues from the Joint Human Rights Office (JHRO), in coordination with the MONUSCO field office in Beni, are actively investigating the allegations. In line with our established methodology, these claims can only be substantiated once they are corroborated by at least two independent sources.

For a story to be substantiated it must be corroborated by at least two independent sources, MONUSCO said.

However, MONUSCO did confirm that ""at least 40 civilians"" were abducted by ""elements of the Allied Democratic Forces"" from Mayeba, the same village named in the beheading reports, on Feb. 10.

Local media reports used hard-to-verify sources

Local media sources widely reported the story, including Radio Okapi, a MONUSCO-supported outlet, that reported that the 70 bodies were discovered on Feb. 15. However, a report from news site 7sur7 citing a phone interview with Vianney Vitswamba, the head of the local ""community protection committee,"" said the bodies were discovered on Feb. 14.

Another news site, Actualite.cd, reported the alleged victims were abducted on Feb. 11-12, also citing Vitswamba. Afrik.com, a news site reporting on African affairs in French, cited Vitswamba for the Feb. 11-12 abductions but reported, without an attribution, that the bodies were discovered on Feb. 14.

A Google search for Vitswamba's name from Jan. 1, 2000, until Feb. 10, 2025, brought up two articles from 7sur7 about another alleged ADF attack in Lubero in January 2025. This is the same territory as the reported February 2025 attack. The 7sur7 articles also cited Vitswamba. There were no results for Vitswamba's name in news reporting prior to 2025, and it was not possible to find credible contact details for him.

Anonymous sources formed backbone of charity reports

Several religious charities also reported on the incident. Open Doors UK, a charity raising awareness of the persecution of Christians worldwide, cited Muhindo Musunzi, the director of a local primary school, who said the ""chaotic security situation"" in the area had caused schools and other public institutions to cease operations. A Google search of Musunzi's name did not bring up credible results prior to the February 2025 story.

Ben Cohen, spokesman for Open Doors UK, told Snopes via email that the organization was ""100% confident"" that the incident occurred. According to Cohen, the group's Africa team spoke to Musunzi about the attack and contacted local church leaders as well.

""We are gathering more information all the time and expect to have a list of the names of those killed. However we have cross checked and can confirm they were all members of local churches. It is a largely Christian area,"" Cohen said.

Both Open Doors UK and Aid to the Church in Need, a Catholic organization supporting persecuted Christians, cited unnamed sources in their reports.

Aid to the Church in Need cited an anonymous source who said the 70 bodies were discovered on Feb. 15. The source was unnamed for their safety, ACN said. Snopes does not rely on anonymous sources to confirm claims. We have reached out them for more information and await their reply.

There were no reports at the time of this writing that ISIS or the ADF had claimed responsibility for the attack.",Center,False
Iowa Becomes the First State to Repeal Civil Rights Protections for Trans People,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-03-03-1248/lgbtq-issues-iowa-becomes-first-state-repeal-civil-rights-protections-trans,The Intercept,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/intercept,Left,https://theintercept.com/2025/03/01/iowa-trans-civil-rights/,"Over the last five years, legislators across the country have escalated their attacks on trans youth and adults.

Iowa, however, now holds the dubious distinction of becoming the first statehouse to repeal civil rights protections for trans people. The bill legislators passed on Thursday explicitly removes civil rights protections that had been enshrined in state law. Once the pro-discrimination bill is signed by Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, trans people in Iowa will no longer be considered a protected category under state law.

The bill’s supporters were clear: They want to be able to discriminate against trans people — and don’t want any barriers like pesky civil rights protections in the way.

“If signed, Iowa will become the first state in American history to remove a protected class from its Civil Rights Act,” wrote Erin Reed, a journalist and trans rights advocate, “setting a dangerous precedent for broader rollbacks of anti-discrimination protections.”

Introduced last week, the new legislation was pushed through at breakneck speed. The Republican-led Iowa Legislature voted 60 to 36 in the House and 33 to 15 in the Senate to pass the bill, which now heads to Reynolds’s desk for signing. Reynolds has been a keen participant in the Republicans’ anti-trans onslaught so is unlikely to push back.

Iowa included gender identity in its civil rights code since 2007 with the aim of protecting against employment, housing, health care, education, and other widespread discrimination that trans people face.

A 2024 study from the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law found that 82 percent of trans people reported experiencing discrimination or harassment at work due to their gender identity or sexual orientation — nearly double the number of cis LGBTQ+ individuals who reported experiencing discrimination. One in 5 trans people have experienced homelessness at some point in their lives.

The move to revoke civil rights — and remove “gender identity” as a protected category — is directly at odds with the Supreme Court’s 2020 decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, which held that the 1964 Civil Rights Act protects employees against discrimination based on sex and gender identity. In line with the Trump administration’s anti-scientific enforcement of two strictly binary sexes, the Iowa bill defines sex as assigned by anatomy at birth.

The Republicans behind the law were unambiguous that civil rights protections were a barrier to enforcing other anti-trans laws on their traditionalist, pro-natalist agenda. It is harder to ban people from bathrooms, from educational spaces, from the public and professional sphere, when those people are understood to have rights.

“All of these common-sense policies are at risk so long as gender identity remains in the Iowa civil rights code,” state Rep. Steven Holt, a Republican supporter of the bill, said on the House floor.

Holt was, of course, referring to the sort of policies that have led to the harassment of both trans and cis people in women’s bathrooms. Such measures have opened the door to proposed genital inspections for children who want to play sports, not to mention the denial of potential lifesaving health care — all in the name of a “common-sense” gender fascism that, for all its alleged naturalness, takes an extraordinary amount of effort and violence to enforce.

It should not need repeating that trans women have never been found to pose a higher risk of perpetrating an assault in a women’s bathroom than cis women; there is no correlation between trans-inclusive policies and a rise in safety risks. Rather it is trans people, particularly trans people of color, who are at significantly elevated risks of violence, including deadly violence.

I only restate this here because much mainstream coverage of anti-trans attacks like the Iowa legislation — including in the New York Times — depicts these discriminatory assaults as if they represent a debate with two reasonable opposing sides, without clarifying the truth: Republican claims to women’s safety concerns are based on a phantasma of threat, and part of a broader drive to erase bodily autonomy.",Left,True
"So Much For RFK, Jr.'s Promise of 'Radical Transparency' at HHS",https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-03-03-1245/public-health-so-much-rfk-jrs-promise-radical-transparency-hhs,Reason,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reason,Center,https://reason.com/2025/02/28/so-much-for-rfk-jr-s-promise-of-radical-transparency-at-hhs/,"The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) upcoming Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee meeting on March 13 was abruptly canceled via email on Wednesday. The committee was to consider the selection of strains to be included in the influenza virus vaccines for the 2025–2026 flu season. This is the second vaccine-related advisory meeting canceled since Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. took over at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

No reason for the cancellation was given, and the committee members were warned against forwarding the email. It suggested that members decline to answer questions from media.

So much for Kennedy's pledge earlier this month of ""radical transparency."" He added, ""We will make our data and our policy process so transparent that people won't even have to file a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request.""

In addition to suggesting members of the FDA's vaccine committee stifle themselves, the HHS will publish a notice next week in the Federal Register to eliminate public comment on that agency's plans and decisions. While past meetings have been open to public scrutiny and participation, it is not clear if the new limits will apply to future meetings of the committee. Radical transparency, indeed.

With respect to the normal processes for evaluating and developing annual flu vaccines, the FDA has previously explained:

The job of producing a new vaccine for the next flu season starts well before the current season ends. For the FDA, it's a year-round initiative.

Flu viruses are constantly evolving. The flu viruses that circulate and cause disease in people often change from one year to another, necessitating a new vaccine every year.

To accomplish this, the FDA, World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other partners collaborate by collecting and reviewing data on the circulating flu strains from around the world to identify those likely to cause the most illness in the upcoming season.

In late February/early March — well before the new influenza season begins, the FDA convenes its vaccines advisory committee to review data about which flu viruses have caused disease in the past year, how the viruses are changing, and disease trends so they can recommend the flu virus strains to include in the vaccines for the upcoming U.S. flu season.

Once the strains are selected, vaccine manufacturers begin the manufacturing process to include the newly selected flu strains in their FDA-approved vaccines. The different virus strains are combined to formulate the vaccine into standard dosages. The vaccine is then filled into vials, syringes and, for the nasal vaccine, sprayers.

Flu vaccine effectiveness varies from year to year depending, among other things, on whether the FDA guessed right about which strains will be circulating each season. The current vaccine is around 40 percent to 60 percent effective against influenza-associated hospitalization.

Noting that the U.S. is currently experiencing one of the worst flu seasons in a decade, Infectious Diseases Society of America president Tina Tan warns that ""cancelling a critically important Food and Drug Administration meeting that is vital to the development of effective flu vaccines for next flu season is irresponsible."" She adds, ""Cancelling this meeting means vaccine makers may not have the vital information and time they need to produce and distribute targeted vaccines before the next flu season. If the FDA meeting is not immediately rescheduled, many lives that could be saved by vaccination will be lost.""

RFK, Jr.'s HHS promises that the FDA ""will make public its recommendations to manufacturers in time for updated vaccines to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season.""

Police detained the driver, who appeared to have ploughed intentionally into the crowd given the speed at which he was driving, prosecutors said in an act Interior Minister Nancy Faeser labeled ""horror in broad daylight"". He did not appear to have been politically or religiously motivated, but there were reasons to believe he was psychologically unwell, said Mannheim Chief Public Prosecutor Romeo Schluessler. Prosecutors have initiated investigative proceedings against the suspect, a 40-year-old German man from the neighbouring state of Rhineland-Palatinate, on two counts of murder and multiple counts of attempted murder. The suspect has not been questioned yet as he had to undergo medical treatment after shooting himself in the mouth with a blank-firing gun after the attack. He appeared to be a landscape gardener who lived alone, prosecutors said, adding that they were now investigating his home for clues. Security has been a key concern in Germany following a string of violent attacks in recent weeks, including deadly car rammings in Magdeburg in December and in Munich last month, as well as a stabbing in Mannheim in May 2024. ""The incident — like the terrible acts of the past months — serves as a stark reminder: we must do everything possible to prevent such acts,"" said Germany's likely next leader, Friedrich Merz, whose conservatives won a national election last month. ""Germany must once again become a safe country. We will work with full determination to achieve this.""

""To all the people of Mannheim, especially to all the relatives of the victims of the attack, to the German people. France is at your side,"" French President Emmanuel Macron wrote on the social media platform X. Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said ""attempts to destabilize democratic nations will not prevail"". The two who died were an 83-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man. NERVOUS CARNIVAL Police were on high alert for this year's carnival parades after social media accounts linked to the Islamic State militant group called for attacks on the events in Cologne and Nuremberg. There did not appear to be a connection between Monday's incident and the carnival celebrations, the interior minister of the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Thomas Strobl, told reporters. Those festivities culminated on Rose Monday with a number of parades, although not in Mannheim, which held its main event on Sunday. Rose Monday, the culmination of the annual carnival season celebrated in Germany's mainly Catholic western and southern regions, features parades of floats that often include comical or satirical references to current affairs. This year's carnival has included floats featuring U.S. President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin, tech billionaire Elon Musk and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Dressed in traditional jester costumes and sporting colourful makeup, thousands of partygoers danced through the streets of Cologne, Dusseldorf and other cities in western and southern Germany ahead of the fasting season of Lent.

Speaker of the House Mike Johnson speaks during a House Republican members conference meeting in Trump National Doral resort, in Miami, Florida, U.S. January 27, 2025. , Summary Republicans, Democrats at odds over Trump spending cuts Both sides say they want to keep government funded until October WASHINGTON, March 3 (Reuters) - With less than two weeks to go before a March 14 deadline, Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. Congress appear to be nowhere close to a deal to avert a government shutdown that would throw Washington into deeper turmoil. The talks have been complicated by President Donald Trump , who has ignored spending laws passed by Congress, suspended foreign aid and fired tens of thousands of federal workers. Both sides say his actions are the biggest sticking point as they seek to reach a deal that would provide government funding beyond March 14, when it is due to expire. Democrats say they are trying to secure guarantees that would prevent Trump and his budget-slashing point person, billionaire Elon Musk , from firing more workers or cancelling more government programs. ""We will continue to make clear that the law has to be followed,"" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters late last week. Republicans say Democrats are trying to undo Trump's actions, which they call a nonstarter. ""The bigger issue is the Democrats' insistence on putting poison pills into the bill that would restrict the president’s abilities,"" Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine told reporters last week. Collins said she is ""very close"" to an agreement with Democrats that would fund the government at current levels through September 30, the end of the fiscal year. Trump has said on social media that he supports that approach. Democratic Senator Patty Murray of Washington said that would give Trump more power to shift funding as he pleases and would create shortfalls for some safety net programs. Both she and Collins have said a flat-line extension would also pose problems for the U.S. military at a time when the United States is confronting challenges from Russia, China and other parts of the world. The spending deal only covers a portion of the budget, funding agencies like the Department of Defense and the Environmental Protection Agency. It would not address the country's rising borrowing costs or rapidly growing benefit programs like Social Security and Medicare. Republicans are separately pushing to extend the tax cuts that Trump signed into law in 2017. One version, which narrowly passed the House last week, would cut taxes by $4.5 trillion and reduce spending by $2 trillion over a decade. Independent analysts say that would further add to the nation's $36 trillion debt load. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson said in a Sunday interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that he was aiming to pass a stopgap funding bill. ""We are working hard to do our responsibility to keep the government open,"" said Johnson, of Louisiana. ""We need our Democrat colleagues to come to the table and be reasonable about that."" Johnson leads a slim 218-215 majority and last year had to repeatedly turn to Democrats to pass legislation through his chamber, where a simple majority suffices. Democratic votes are needed to pass most bills in the Senate, where Republicans currently hold a 53-47 majority, short of the 60-vote threshold for most legislation. Trump's administration has made clear that its budget cutting efforts will continue. Officials last week ordered federal agencies to lay the groundwork for further layoffs, beyond the 100,000 who have already been fired or offered a buyout. The government employed 2.3 million civilian workers last year. Failure to reach a spending deal by March 14 would force the government to furlough hundreds of thousands of workers and shutter ""nonessential"" operations , such as financial regulation and trash pickup at national parks. The last government shutdown was also the longest, ending in January 2019 after 35 days, as Trump during his first term in office and lawmakers clashed over his effort to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. With no clear resolution in sight, lawmakers have already begun pointing fingers. ""Republicans have a responsibility to fund the government,"" Jeffries said last week, pointing out that Republicans control both chambers of Congress and the White House. Representative John Rutherford, a Florida Republican, said if Democrats vote against the ""clean"" extension of spending through September, ""they're the ones voting for the shutdown, not us.""

Cryptocurrency gets major boost after Donald Trump backs crypto ‘strategic reserve’,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-03-03-1221/economy-and-jobs-cryptocurrency-gets-major-boost-after-donald-trump-backs,New York Post (News),https://www.allsides.com/news-source/new-york-post,Lean Right,https://nypost.com/2025/03/03/business/cryptocurrency-gets-major-boost-after-donald-trump-backs-crypto-strategic-reserve/,"Crypto assets gave up some of their gains on Monday after getting a massive boost over the weekend from President Trump’s announcement of a new US strategic reserve of digital assets.

While Bitcoin dropped nearly 9% on Monday — after surging by 20% a day earlier — stocks of major US crypto firms initially soared on bets that the Trump administration is poised to execute an aggressively pro-crypto agenda in the months ahead.

The commander-in-chief said on Sunday that he plans to stockpile a basket of coins that include Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana, and Cardano ahead of Friday’s first-ever White House crypto summit.

“Obviously, BTC and ETH, as other valuable Cryptocurrencies, will be at the heart of the Reserve,” he wrote on Truth Social. “I will make sure the US is the Crypto Capital of the World.”

Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value, fell to around $86,000 as of 4 p.m. ET on Monday, while Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, suffered a 16% decline, to just above $2,100 — after rising 14% on Sunday.

Investor Joe Lonsdale, the co-founder of Palantir and a close associate of Elon Musk, questioned the need for a strategic reserve of crypto.

“It’s wrong to steal my money for grift on the left; it’s also wrong to tax me for crypto bro schemes,” Lonsdale wrote on X.

However, stocks of top US crypto firms were up in Monday morning trading in New York on the back of Trump’s announcement before retreating later in the day.

Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy and the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, fell nearly 3% in afternoon trading after surging 2% earlier in the day. Crypto miners Riot Platforms and MARA Holdings also gave up their gains after jumping 7% and 9%, respectively.

James Butterfill, head of research at asset manager CoinShares, said the idea “suggests a more patriotic stance toward the broader crypto technology space, with little regard for the fundamental qualities of these assets.”

Trump was a one-time crypto critic, calling Bitcoin a “scam” against the dollar in June 2021 before making a U-turn during the 2024 campaign.

But his new administration is set to take a lighter touch approach to regulating digital assets.

Digital asset investors have also been buoyed by his pick of pro-crypto lawyer Paul Atkins to run the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Many in the industry were unhappy with the previous administration’s SEC chair, Gary Gensler, who launched a string of lawsuits against crypto firms.

Kraken said earlier on Monday that the federal regulator had agreed to drop a Gensler-backed case brought in November 2023.

It accused the company of acting as a broker, dealer, and exchange without registering with the SEC.

Just last week, the financial watchdog agreed to toss a similar complaint against Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US.",Lean Right,True
‘Incredible uniformity’: The West’s ‘Kardashian-esque’ identity crisis,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-03-03-0959/culture-incredible-uniformity-west-s-kardashian-esque-identity-crisis,The Blaze,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/theblaze-bias,Far Right,https://www.theblaze.com/shows/zero-hour/western-civilization-identity,"From woke ideology to digital disincarnation, Western civilization has been collapsing into total chaos as purpose, tradition, and identity are melting away.

Jonathan Pageau, Symbolic World Press founder and master icon carver, and James Poulos of “Zero Hour” are well-aware — and they understand that the loss of traditional values is directly tied into why Americans are facing such an identity crisis.

“Maybe some of our identity problems that everyone seems to be suffering through has to do with the fact that we can’t understand who we are in a world that is constantly filled with words,” Poulos theorizes.

“I agree,” Pageau answers. “We tend to forget that identity is participation, it’s not actually totally who you think you are, or how you think about yourself, it’s where you are and how you participate in that world.”

“And so, identity is something that you engage in,” Pageau continues. “Participating in the world that you’re in, being a father, being a husband, being a part of your community. When you do that, in practice, a lot of the identity problems just go away.”

On a macro level, something like the national anthem is a great example of where identity is formed — and where it’s been broken.

“The attack on the national anthem that happened a few years ago in all these sports events, that is a sign of identity fragmentation. You know, because identity and being something and participating in something never means that you agree with everything that ever happened in the history of the thing you’re in,” Pageau explains.

“I am Pageau, and I come from a line of people and family, and I’m happy for that, but it doesn’t mean that everything that everybody’s ever done in my family lineage is worthy of praise,” he continues.

However, as we’ve catapulted everything and everyone under the sun into the social media spotlight, identity fragmentation like this has become harder to avoid.

“You create the internet, and you say, ‘This is amazing, it’s going to be like the ultimate library,’ and then as time goes on, the number of books in that library seems somehow to start shrinking, or every book that you pull off the shelf starts to look strangely increasingly similar to every other book,” Poulos says.

“And you look at Instagram and the beauty standards on Instagram. You know they’re trying so hard to say, ‘No, you can be as big of a mutant, you can disfigure yourself as much as possible, and that’s beautiful, too,’ but what’s really happening in the vast majority is just sort of coalescing around this kind of alien-esque, Kardashian-esque,” he continues.

“It’s like when they would do those composites of, you know, ‘We took every race in the world and sort of turned it into one face,’ and it’s kind of becoming that one face. Incredible uniformity,” he adds.

The true cost of Net Zero,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-03-03-0957/climate-change-true-cost-net-zero,UnHerd,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/unherd-media-bias,Center,https://unherd.com/2025/03/the-true-cost-of-net-zero/,"If you think your energy bill is already high, brace yourself. Labour may have promised a Net Zero electricity system that would cut average bills by £300 — but as new research reveals, the opposite is going to happen. We can expect the cost of electricity to increase by at least 75%.

“I have absolute faith,” energy secretary Ed Miliband has said, that Net Zero will “do great things for our country and our world.” Inconveniently, an investigation by one of Britain’s leading energy experts provides evidence that our growing reliance on Miliband’s beloved renewable forms of energy, not the “rollercoaster” fossil fuels market, is more likely to have a devastating economic effect.

For the past two months, Professor Gordon Hughes, a senior fellow at Washington’s National Centre for Energy Analytics and Edinburgh University’s former head of economics, has been working with UnHerd to develop a sophisticated computer model of the UK’s electricity system which provides a robust picture of power generation and why the economic pain is only set to continue.

Miliband, according to Hughes, is starting from a false premise. He is “unambiguously wrong” to claim that the principal cause of rising bills to date has been the price of natural gas. In fact, the wholesale price of electricity, which is where changes in fossil fuel prices are most clearly seen, has generally been constant for the past 20 years. And yet in that same period, electricity bills paid by businesses have almost quadrupled, while those of domestic households have more or less trebled.

It’s true that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 saw the European natural gas price surge briefly by up to 500%, while there was a smaller, short-lived spike in 2008, caused by an imbalance between supply and demand. But to blame, as Miliband does,“petrostates and dictators” for the fluctuations is, according to Hughes, just a “convenient scapegoat”. In fact, it’s the ever-growing thicket of taxes, levies and subsidies, stemming from the switch to renewables, which has caused the price increase, for these added extras now comprise more than three-quarters of the cost of electricity on household bills. According to Hughes, “the steady increase in inflation-adjusted electricity prices over the last two decades is largely a matter of self-inflicted harm”.

And his model reveals that under the Government’s 2030 clean power plan, much worse is yet to come.

For true believers like Miliband, this would be a price worth paying if Britain really could become a net-zero paradise. But unfortunately, given the basic inefficiency of renewables, and the fact they often don’t generate power for hours or days at a time, fossil fuels are destined to remain part of our energy mix for many years. This means that if we want to keep the lights on, we are going to have to spend billions of pounds well before 2030 to build new, back-up gas-fired power plants that Miliband claims will only be used 5% of the time, simply because so many in our existing fleet are worn out.

The single biggest element in the coming increase projected by the model is the cost of the planned expansion in renewables. Official estimates of its cost, says Hughes, are too low, and judging by recent market data, the price for constructing new wind and solar farms is likely to be around £150 billion over the next five years — all of which will be added to bills.

Another factor is Britain’s increasing dependence on electricity supplied via undersea cables from abroad. According to the Hughes model, the more electricity we import, the more we pay. But without it, there will be blackouts. In 2024, after all, Britain was a net electricity importer 91% of the time. Yet foreign energy cannot be relied on. Norway has already passed a law allowing its government to block the sale of electricity when its own supply is scarce. Other countries may well follow suit.

You might argue that high prices from European supplies are, in turn, caused by spikes in the natural gas market. But that, Hughes’s model shows, would once again be false: gas accounts for less than 15% of Germany’s energy mix, and less than 5% of France’s. And while Miliband claims his Net Zero plans are needed because gas prices are always bound to rise, that’s also untrue. In Europe, the long-term trend has been stable for 25 years, while in America, the fracking boom has seen costs fall. In other words, to insure against another 2022 — an unusually bad year — Miliband wants to transform British energy in ways that Hughes’s model shows will incur much long-term hardship. That, he notes, “seems like rather a bad bargain”.

“While Miliband claims his Net Zero plans are needed because gas prices are always bound to rise, that’s untrue.”

Worse is to come, especially once Labour’s green revolution really kicks in. It’s certainly true that wind and solar farms can generate energy from nature, saving operators on fuel costs. But the “full system costs” of renewables wipe out these gains. If, for example, the wind doesn’t blow, turbines will need backup generators. And though Miliband says he wants an eightfold increase in large-scale batteries to store electricity when the weather doesn’t cooperate, the technology only functions for around two hours. This winter, we’ve had days on end without wind, and Hughes’s model suggests batteries would make up just 10-15% of the shortfall.

How, then, would Britain secure the rest of the energy it needs? With natural gas! While Miliband claims gas-powered plants will only need to operate 5% of the time by 2030, Hughes suggests the real figure will be at least three times as high — bearing in mind that the Government says growth in electric vehicles, heat pumps and immigration will increase demand for electricity by 11%. To create a reserve big enough to cope when renewables aren’t functioning and parts of the system “trip off” because of a fault, Hughes says that by 2030, Britain will need some 50 gigawatts (GW) of gas or diesel generating capacity, up from 30 GW now, partly because nuclear stations are due to shut, and we cannot rely on electricity always being available from abroad.

Of course, existing gas plants could remain operational, but only run when needed. But this would ignore another problem. The “open cycle” variety of gas-powered turbines that can be fired up quickly, making them suitable for occasional use, have a lifespan of around 30 years — and almost all in Britain have already reached this limit. By 2030, two-thirds of the less adaptable “closed cycle” type will be similarly aged. Even if we make generous assumptions about how many old facilities might still be available, this means building a whole new fleet over just five years, even though these plants would often lie idle.

All this will obviously cost billions. Current turbine prices come in at some £60 million per GW, so building new back-up plants with a total capacity of 30 GW would cost £18 billion, and 50 GW £30 billion. This implies a further question. With the economy in the doldrums, and the Treasury under pressure to fund budget increases in health and defence, how exactly would Miliband pay for his net-zero dreams? Here, again, the answer is levies on bills, the fees that have already raided pockets so dramatically. Contracts for backup power plants are issued by the Government through what it calls the “capacity market”. This is already skyrocketing, from £120 million in 2017 to £1.1 billion in 2024. With renewables continuing to crowd out reliable alternatives, the capacity market is increasingly needed. And Hughes’s model says these levies are likely to reach an eyewatering £7.4 billion by 2030 — a conservative estimate.

The model identifies still further costs. One is the permits operators must buy to burn gas and other fossil fuels, and whose prices are constantly rising. Then there’s the so-called “balancing mechanism” — whereby operators are paid to generate energy in an emergency, or else cut off production entirely in the case of grid bottlenecks. Taking in all these factors, Hughes’s model suggests the cost of electricity production could reach almost £60 billion by 2030, between 70 and 80% higher than it would be if the UK stuck with its current, non-Net Zero system.

Nor is this even the whole story. All told, electricity generation only accounts for about half your bill. Most of the rest is formed of “network charges” — paid to the National Grid and energy firms for ensuring the power gets from producers to end users. The exact numbers are more difficult to calculate. But the National Electricity System Operator (NESO), the Government-owned company that runs the grid, has said that to create a Net Zero system, it will need to vastly expand its network to link up new wind and solar farms. The upshot? A potential outlay of £65 billion by 2030, with network charges rising from between 80 and 117%.

The economic impact of all this, it hardly needs stating, would be disastrous. “It is a tax on all of us,” is how Hughes puts it. “Electricity-intensive industries which compete in world markets can only meet it by reducing wages or profits. Since workers are unwilling to accept reductions in their incomes, the result has been that they have closed their activities in the UK and moved elsewhere.” The evidence is already in, with the recent demise of the Bridgend steelworks, the pending closure of the Grangemouth refinery and the likely end of car manufacturing at the BMW factory in Oxford. Vauxhall, Hotpoint, JCB and niche manufacturers of items such as mattresses are also cutting jobs and have warned they may soon leave Britain too.

Not that Ed Miliband seems to mind. Only last week, he reiterated his commitment to Labour’s net-zero targets, stating that “the single most important thing we can do is stick to our clean power mission”. It seems that to a man seeking to build a world-leading utopia, something as transient as Britain’s future prosperity doesn’t mean very much.

What’s Behind Trump’s Love-Hate Relationship With Canada,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-03-03-0955/donald-trump-what-s-behind-trump-s-love-hate-relationship-canada,New York Times (News),https://www.allsides.com/news-source/new-york-times,Lean Left,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/us/politics/trump-canada-trade-tariffs.html,"There is the theory that President Trump is still bitter about his Canadian hotel ventures that went bust.

Some, on social media, have speculated that a 2019 photograph in which Justin Trudeau appeared poised to kiss Melania Trump, the first lady, at a Group of 7 gathering in France, left Mr. Trump with a grudge against the dashing Canadian prime minister.

And then there is the transactional view, that Mr. Trump sees the acquisition of Canada as the 51st state as the ultimate real estate deal that would seal his presidential legacy.

As Mr. Trump prepares to push ahead with a new round of tariffs on the United States’ neighbors to the north and south, he has expressed a special brand of loathing for Canada. The bullying of a country whose most prominent stereotype is that its people are “nice” has led to political upheaval in Canada and created both consternation and speculation about why Mr. Trump wants to engage in a trade war with one of America’s biggest trading partners.

“I can’t quite figure it out,” said Stephen Moore, the Heritage Foundation economist and former adviser to Mr. Trump. “Whether it’s some kind of strategic leverage, I don’t know.”

Noting that there is “no love lost” between the president and Mr. Trudeau, Mr. Moore added: “With Trump, politics is personal.”

Mr. Trump has threatened to hit Mexico and Canada with 25 percent tariffs on all imports on Tuesday unless the countries do more to prevent migrants and drugs from flowing into the United States. On Saturday, the president picked another trade fight with Canada, this time over lumber.

Intrigue abounds in Canada about why Mr. Trump has repeatedly belittled a neighbor and threatened to destabilize its economy with tariffs, a process that has brought relations between the two countries to a low point not seen in decades.

In contrast to the close and supportive relationship that Mr. Trudeau, who is entering his final week in office, enjoyed with another U.S. president, Barack Obama, his relationship with Mr. Trump has been fractious.

While Mr. Trudeau was generally circumspect in his public remarks about Mr. Trump during the president’s first administration, the two men have dramatically different personal and political styles. Mr. Trump bombastically denigrates people he perceives as opponents, whereas Mr. Trudeau often speaks about the value of bringing people together, what he once called a “sunny ways” approach to political life.

In candid remarks to a group of business leaders last month that was captured by a microphone, Mr. Trudeau offered a theory for Mr. Trump’s Canada obsession that is widely shared in the country.

“Not only does the Trump administration know how many critical minerals we have, but that may be even why they keep talking about absorbing us and making us the 51st state,” Mr. Trudeau told the gathering in Toronto.

“They’re very aware of our resources,” Mr. Trudeau said, “of what we have, and they very much want to be able to benefit from those.”

He added: “But Mr. Trump has it in mind that one of the easiest ways of doing that is absorbing our country. And it is a real thing.”

Mr. Trump does have a particular affinity for minerals. He has been pushing to broker a deal to secure access to Ukraine’s supply of rare earths as he seeks to broker an agreement to end its war with Russia.

As a businessman, Mr. Trump had two dealings with Canada that, while relatively limited, were both failures. The Toronto hotel and condominium project, owned by a Toronto investor who licensed the Trump name and hired a Trump company to manage it, went into receivership in 2016. The following year, a hotel owned by Malaysian investors bearing the Trump name, again under license and with a similar management contract, opened in Vancouver, British Columbia. (Promotional material exaggerated the building’s height.) It failed, as well.

“Trump’s name and brand have no more place on Vancouver’s skyline than his ignorant ideas have in the modern world,” Mr. Robertson wrote.

Before delving into politics, Mr. Trump expressed little ill will toward Canada.

In 2012, when the Obama administration was delaying a decision on approving the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would have transported oil from Canada to the United States, Mr. Trump declared on social media that the project must move forward.

“We need to use our resources and support allies like Canada,” Mr. Trump said.

But by 2015, his perceived failings of the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico became a central issue of Mr. Trump’s first presidential campaign. Mr. Trump routinely called the deal a “disaster” for American workers, and prioritized scrapping the pact as a first order of business if he won the election.

An agreement to overhaul the trade deal was signed in 2020 after fraught negotiations between the three countries that often grew contentious. At one point, Mr. Trump suggested leaving Canada on the sidelines and proceeding with a deal between the United States and Mexico.

Now back in office, Mr. Trump has made clear that the agreement he signed did not do enough for the United States and must be rewritten. In recent days he has lashed out at Chrystia Freeland, the Canadian official who negotiated it on behalf of Canada.

“She’s a whack,” Mr. Trump said of Ms. Freeland, who was Canada’s deputy prime minister and finance minister during the president’s first term, in an interview with The Spectator.

As Mr. Trump has wielded the threat of new tariffs on Canada over the last month, his tone toward the departing prime minister has been even more derisive. He has nicknamed Mr. Trudeau “governor” amid persistent suggestions that the United States might annex Canada.

Mr. Trump even called for the former Canadian hockey player Wayne Gretzky to run for prime minister, suggesting late last year that he would “win easily.” Mr. Gretzky, who does not support Canada’s joining the United States, has faced backlash at home from citizens who view him as a traitor because of his association with Mr. Trump.

The insults have led to a boom in nationalism in Canada, including “Made in Canada” Facebook groups. In one group, which has more than a million members, Canadians compared notes on pancake mixes that are made in Canada and offered recommendations on flavors of Cove Soda, a potential alternative to Coca-Cola.",Left,False

"Ukraine still ready to sign minerals deal despite Trump spat, Zelenskyy says",https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-03-03-0951/ukraine-war-ukraine-still-ready-sign-minerals-deal-despite-trump-spat-zelenskyy,Euronews,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/euronews-media-bias,Center,https://www.euronews.com/2025/03/03/zelenskyy-says-ukraine-ready-to-sign-minerals-deal-after-spat-with-trump,"Ukraine is ready to sign the minerals deal with Washington, despite the heated argument between him and his US counterpart on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters late Sunday.

Mere days after leaving the White House without signing the deal with US President Donald Trump, Zelenskyy said, ""I just want the Ukrainian position to be heard. We want our partners to remember who the aggressor is in this war.""

The meeting turned into a terse exchange of words live on TV, with Trump concluding the raw minerals deal — which brought Zelenskyy to the White House to begin with — was off.

""I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations,"" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform Friday.

""I don’t want advantage, I want peace. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for peace,"" he announced.

US access to Ukraine's rare earth minerals was first presented to Zelenskyy by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent earlier in February.

Washington is asking for a 50% cut of all revenues generated from Ukraine's mineral and natural resources in what US officials have said is payment for previous military support.

According to the deal, Ukraine will contribute the proceeds to a fund, which will then be invested to ""promote the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine.""

Zelenskyy has said that the deal must include real security guarantees for Ukraine and warned against further Russian aggression if these were not put into place.

His comments about the deal came at the end of a two-day summit in the United Kingdom, where UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the UK and France would gather a ""coalition of the willing"" that would draw up a peace plan for Ukraine.

“We are at a crossroads in history today,” Starmer said.

“This is not a moment for more talk. It’s time to act. Time to step up and lead and to unite around a new plan for a just and enduring peace.”

Prior to this, Bessent told CBS News that the Ukrainian leader had ""thrown off the sequencing"" of how the minerals and peace deal were supposed to play out, insisting the discussions should have taken place in private.

It was ""impossible to have an economic deal without a peace deal,"" Bessent said.",Center,True

Trump Turns Up Trade Pressure on China After Beijing Fails to Come Running,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-03-03-0501/trade-trump-turns-trade-pressure-china-after-beijing-fails-come-running,New York Times (News),https://www.allsides.com/news-source/new-york-times,Lean Left,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/us/politics/trump-tariffs-china.html,"When President Trump threatened tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China in January, saying those countries needed to do more to stop the flow of drugs and migrants into the United States, Canadian and Mexican officials raced to Washington, bearing charts and videos detailing their efforts to toughen their borders.

Canada created a “fentanyl czar” and committed fresh resources to combating organized crime, while Mexico dispatched troops to the border and delivered cartel operatives into U.S. custody. As a result, Mr. Trump paused tariffs on America’s North American neighbors for 30 days.

China never made these kinds of overtures and, in Mr. Trump’s view, did not take any big moves to stop the flow of fentanyl into the United States. So on Feb. 4, Mr. Trump moved forward with imposing a 10 percent tariff on all Chinese imports. Last week, the president said that on March 4 he would add another 10 percent on top of all existing Chinese tariffs.

Mr. Trump is moving quickly to transform the U.S.-China trade relationship. The Chinese are moving much more cautiously and deliberately as they try to assess Mr. Trump and determine what it is he actually wants from China. Some of Mr. Trump’s advisers, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have held calls with their Chinese counterparts. But a call between Mr. Trump and Xi Jinping, China’s leader, has failed to materialize.

The situation underscores the quandary for foreign leaders in dealing with a president as unpredictable and unconventional as Mr. Trump, who is making substantial changes to trade terms with little advance notice or preparation.

The Chinese do not want to initiate a conversation because they do not want to be seen as pleading, and are wary of offering concessions before they understand the parameters of the debate, people familiar with the discussions said. Instead, Chinese officials, academics and others close to the government have been holding discreet conversations to try to determine Mr. Trump’s motives, while floating various aspects of a potential trade deal between the countries to assess the Americans’ reaction.

“With my experience with the Chinese, they are suspicious in the initial rounds of a negotiation that there are hidden traps or other reasons to be cautious,” said Michael Pillsbury, a China expert who advises the Trump administration on dealing with the country.

The Chinese side has conveyed they would like to work with the United States on mutually beneficial measures. But they have been struggling to identify people in the United States that they see as reliable channels for communication, according to a person close to the Chinese government.

They are also trying to assess the significance of some recent steps by the administration, like a memorandum that proposed strict limits on investment between the countries. Mr. Trump publicly contradicted that memo days after he signed it, saying he welcomed Chinese investment.

“I think the Chinese are in a wait and listen mode,” said Myron Brilliant, who has spent years working with businesses to understand the Chinese and recently returned from a trip to China. “They’re taking in all kinds of input, they’re beginning their consultations, they’re not pushing the panic button just yet.”

“There is a willingness, an appetite to do a deal with the Trump administration, but China doesn’t want preconditions on that, and seeks more clarity on the parameters of a deal,” said Mr. Brilliant, a senior counselor at DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group, an advisory firm.

They called for treating China as an equal partner and criticized past measures taken by the Biden administration to “contain” China, like export controls. The delegation also threatened that, if further U.S. tariffs went into effect, China could withdraw a law enforcement package that it had put together to combat the fentanyl trade, which included information that could be used to prosecute Chinese companies, one of the people said. They acknowledged that the Chinese economy was struggling and that more tariffs could hurt it.

Current and former advisers and others familiar with Mr. Trump’s thinking say he has expressed interest in striking a wide-ranging deal with Mr. Xi, which could involve Chinese purchases and investment, as well as cooperation on issues like nuclear security.

But Mr. Trump also believes that China reneged on the deal he signed with it in 2020 by not purchasing enough products. Mr. Trump also has no aversion to ramping up the pressure on Beijing by imposing tariffs, seeing them as a source of leverage in negotiations.

Mr. Trump has said he has a great relationship with Mr. Xi and would like the Chinese to invest in the United States. When asked in February if he would do a trade deal with China, Mr. Trump responded, “It’s possible.”

In an interview on Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures, Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, said that instead of stopping the manufacturing of fentanyl, the Chinese were giving “the maximum subsidy” to people making the ingredients.

“The Chinese need to stop this murder of Americans,” he said.

The tariffs that Mr. Trump has threatened to impose on China since coming into office are already roughly comparable to those he imposed during his first administration, said Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. In 2018, Mr. Trump put tariffs ranging from 7.5 to 25 percent on more than $350 billion of Chinese imports, levies that remain in effect.

“It’s still early days,” Mr. Kennedy said. “This should be seen as the floor of what’s imposed, not the ceiling.”

Beijing has so far been cautious in retaliating, answering Mr. Trump’s first volley of tariffs with a more limited number of its own. But it has signaled that it is willing to go further, possibly using its dominance in the global supply chain to exact pain.

The Chinese delegation that included Mr. Cui had come to New York as China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, visited the United Nations. While Mr. Wang did not continue on to Washington, according to one source, the Chinese embassy helped to arrange meetings for Mr. Cui in the nation’s capital.

Senior Communist Party officials including Fang Xinghai, the former deputy chief of China’s markets regulator, and the economist Zhu Min, also traveled to Washington and met with some members of the think tank community and government.

The Chinese appear to be exploring the best points of contact for their government. In the previous Trump administration, the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, served as an important go-between, as did private sector figures. Recently, the Chinese have been probing the role that Elon Musk — who has extensive business interests in China through Tesla — will play in the Trump administration.

Privately, the Chinese have indicated a willingness to start negotiating a deal but want to know that they have direct access to Mr. Trump.

“There seems to be a sense that Beijing is blaming what has happened on the poor communication channels,” said Yun Sun, the director of the China program at the Stimson Center, a research group in Washington.",Center,False
"EU leaders prepare ‘concrete’ measures on defense financing, sources say",https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-03-03-0459/defense-and-security-eu-leaders-prepare-concrete-measures-defense-financing,CNBC,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnbc,Center,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/03/eu-leaders-prepare-concrete-measures-on-defense-financing-sources-say.html,"watch now

LONDON — The European Union is expected to announce ""concrete"" measures on boosting defense financing this week, sources told CNBC, as Europe and the United States clash over support for Ukraine.

The 27 EU leaders will gather in Brussels on Thursday for a meeting dedicated to defense and support for Ukraine. It follows two particularly tense moments in U.S.-Europe relations: Vice President JD Vance's speech in Munich in mid-February when he criticized European leaders; and the on-the-record clash between the U.S. administration and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on Friday.

European leaders are trying not to alienate President Donald Trump after he criticized Zelenskyy for ""gambling"" over a potential World War III. At the same time, Europeans know they have to take immediate action to ensure that Ukraine continues to receive the support it needs — and any further aggression from Russian President Vladimir Putin is prevented.

""There will be intense work in the coming days,"" an EU official, who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the discussions but is part of the preparations for Thursday's meeting, told CNBC Monday.

The same official said the aim is to announce ""concrete deliverables"" on the financing of defense.

Traders will be watching the talks between EU officials closely. The European Stoxx Aerospace and Defense index has risen almost 23% in the year to date as investors bet on spending hikes, and was over 6% higher in Monday morning trade.

Trump has often criticized European nations for failing to spend 2% of their GDP on defense, as stipulated by NATO rules. Since Trump's first term, several countries have increased their defense spending and the latest NATO figures indicate that 23 of the 32 members are expected to have achieved the 2% target in 2024.

Now, many NATO members are looking to increase spending even more, with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte telling CNBC in February that the figure will have to be ""much more than than 2%."" Trump, meanwhile, has called for 5% of GDP as the NATO contribution target.

How to spend more on defense

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced in February that EU fiscal rules will be updated to allow countries to spend more on defense without being constrained by specific debt and deficit targets.

The unnamed EU official told CNBC that the next announcement will go even further. ""We are looking at additional funding for defense at the EU level, including through flexibility in the use of structural funds and adaptation of the EIB mandate,"" the official said.

The European Investment Bank, which is targeting 95 billion euros ($99.26 billion) in investments in 2025, is currently constrained to only financing dual-use defense projects, which means they have to have both civil and military purposes.

A second EU official, who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the talks, confirmed to CNBC Monday that Von der Leyen is expected to present ""concrete measures"" in terms of defense financing in the coming days. These will then be discussed by EU leaders on Thursday.

""We urgently have to rearm Europe. And for that I will present a comprehensive plan to the leaders on how to rearm Europe on 6 March when we have our European Council,"" von der Leyen said at a summit in London on Sunday.

In a recent report called ""Defending Europe without the U.S.,"" Brussels-based think tank Bruegel calculated that Europe could need ""300,000 more troops and an annual defence spending hike of at least 250 billion euros in the short term to deter Russian aggression.""

Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, said in a note Sunday that ""in the absence of offsetting fiscal measures, the Euro area needs to fund an additional 0.6% of GDP annually to meet the defence spending target at 2.5%.""

One key question is whether the EU will go so far as to agree to common borrowing for defense projects. The bloc decided to take that unprecedented step in 2020 in the wake of the pandemic (known as NextGenerationEU) and some member states believe this should be replicated for defense spending. However, more fiscally conservative nations want to exhaust other options before taking that step.

According to Goldman Sachs, EU leaders could ""repurpose"" the outstanding financial capacity from the NextGenerationEU funds for defense. They could then look at a new program, which ""could provide stable funding shielding defence spending from idiosyncratic national factors,"" the analysts added.",Center,True

Friday's Oval Office blowup was ""extremely frustrating"" and a ""missed opportunity for everybody,"" Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., said, because ""Ukraine is still in a precarious position"" before potential talks to end Russia's war on Ukraine.

""This ultimately, obviously, there needs to be a negotiated settlement,"" Lawler told NPR. ""I think what President Trump is trying to do is get Vladimir Putin to the table for a negotiation.

""In order to have the strongest possible hand in that negotiation, I think the objective is to have an economic cooperation agreement with Ukraine and the United States, which will strengthen that ability to negotiate.

""And in order to negotiate a settlement, you need to get both sides to the table. Joe Biden's administration did not engage with Putin for over three years. That obviously complicates the ability to get someone to the table to have an initial discussion.""

Zelenskyy balked at the minerals deal because it did not come with security guarantees, but Lawler noted economic cooperation with Trump's America is de facto security against further Putin aggression.

""In order for Ukraine to have a very strong hand in the negotiation, the greater the economic cooperation with the U.S. moving forward, the more investment guarantees from the U.S., the easier it will be long term to have security guarantees, and that's important,"" Lawler said.

Trump is playing chess, while Zelenskyy was sticking to his old war-aid talking points he had used during the Biden administration, and Lawler rejected the NPR interviewer's suggestion Trump was scoring an economic prize out of Ukraine.

""It's not about giving to the U.S.: They're going to need significant economic investment to rebuild when this conflict is over like the rest of Europe during World War II in the aftermath,"" Lawler said.

""So, having this economic cooperation agreement is critical for the rebuilding efforts moving forward.

""And by having that level of U.S. investment and engagement, when there is a final agreement, it's going to be a lot harder for Vladimir Putin to renege on it and invade Ukraine again with U.S. investment on the ground.

""The only winner the other day was Vladimir Putin, that this deal did not happen.""

The Democrats’ young man problem is real,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-03-03-0456/politics-democrats-young-man-problem-real,Vox,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/vox-news-media-bias,Left,https://www.vox.com/politics/402055/democrats-young-man-problem-gen-z-republican-shift-vote-trump,"On a random Tuesday in February, a conservative provocateur and talk radio host made a bold proclamation about the state of the Democratic Party. Donald Trump had won over young men, and nearly a majority of young voters overall in November, because “Democrats, for men, are pussies.”

“There are no masculine men in the Democrat Party right now,” Clay Travis, the Trump-supporting sports and politics commentator, said while speaking on a panel hosted at the University of Chicago. “Who’s the most masculine Democrat right now in America? Mayor Pete?”

His audience gasped in response. The moderator intervened. And so began a week of debate and commentary about the relationship — or lack thereof — between the Trump-era Democratic Party and the Gen Z men who abandoned them last year.

In hindsight, all the signs were there that the 2024 election would feature a yawning gender gap between Trump-curious men, and more liberal women. What polls predicted came true: a shift of Gen Z voters toward Republicans, driven by young men voting for Trump. Since then, plenty of postmortems have tried to wrestle with just what went wrong with the Democratic pitch. Still, the question remains: Will this dynamic linger? And if so, how worried should Democrats be?

A month into the second Trump presidency, the alarm bells are still ringing. While the president’s honeymoon is fading, he remains quite popular with the youngest cohort of men.

As Democrats attempt to redefine themselves ahead of next year’s midterm elections, they’ll need to accurately diagnose why young men have jumped ship in large numbers.

In reviewing the data and talking to experts, three main explanations emerge.

First, there’s the structural: the effects and aftermath of the Covid pandemic and economic pressures that explain the shift of young men to the right.

Then, there are Trump-specific dynamics, related to his persona, his campaign and media strategy last year, and his ability to define himself independently of the two-party, liberal-conservative spectrum.

And finally, there are cultural, education, and gender dynamics that explain the divide — which Democrats have driven, and can still fix.

But if Democrats are to make any progress, their first step must be rooting out denial: When it comes to young men, the party has a real problem.

What the Democrats’ young male problem looks like

The Gen Z gender gap isn’t easy to map out, so it’s helpful to look at a few factors — vote choice, political ideology, partisan identification, and favorability ratings — to try to figure out what’s going on.

The first, vote choice, is the easiest, but also bluntest, tool to use. Using estimates from AP VoteCast surveys, in 2024, young men backed Trump by a 14-point margin; young women backed Harris by a 17-point margin. Trump’s share of the young male vote increased from 41 percent in 2020 to 56 percent in 2024 per AP VoteCast data by CIRCLE at Tufts University. And it’s young white and Latino men who shifted most dramatically to the right, by 22 points and 38 points respectively.

Partisan identification shows some of this change too. Over the last 20 years, it’s young men who have been more likely to identify as Republicans, according to Gallup polling data. The share of young women, aged 18-29, who identify as or lean toward Democrats has remained steady since about 2003, while the share of young men who identify with Republicans has steadily grown since 2015.

Puzzlingly, the change in partisan leaning has not been accompanied by a corresponding self-reported change in young men’s political ideology. They have not been calling themselves more “conservative” over that same timeline. Instead, it’s young women who have gotten much more liberal over the last two decades, while the share of men who call themselves conservative has remained steady. According to Gallup polling, women 18 to 29 who call themselves liberal are now at the highest level they’ve been since 1999, a trend that picked up during the second Obama term and the first Trump presidency. A plurality of young men, meanwhile, have called themselves moderate over the last 20 years, with shares of young conservatives and young liberals also remaining steady.

What this all suggests is two opposite shifts: Young women are identifying as more liberal, but not necessarily more Democratic. Young men, meanwhile, are identifying as more Republican, but not more conservative. It’s a point that Daniel Cox, the director of the American Enterprise Institute’s Survey Center on American Life, was trying to make on the same panel that Travis blew up at the University of Chicago. His argument is that issues, and the positions the political parties are taking, only explain so much.

Young women are identifying as more liberal, but not necessarily more Democratic. Young men, meanwhile, are identifying as more Republican, but not more conservative.

“You have a slow decline. This didn’t happen in just one election. There’s been a deterioration of Democratic identity among young men for over 10 years,” Cox said. “This group looks a lot more liberal on paper. You had six in 10 young men who are moderates vote for Trump, and more than one in five liberal young men vote for Trump…There’s something about Trump that was attractive and then there’s something about the Democratic Party, at least in its current manifestation, that was repellent.”

Explanation No. 1: It’s bigger than America

There is no one explanation for these dynamics, but breaking out a few theories can help explain the situation.

We can start with structural, post-Covid explanations. The shift of young people to the right in general isn’t only happening in the United States, but all over the world. Something about this generation’s experiences, regardless of gender, is causing a rightward shift.

That shift mirrors the anti-establishment, anti-incumbency trend that democracies have been experiencing since the start of the coronavirus pandemic: frustration with the economic prospects; the squeeze of inflation and prices, and distrust in institutions, which in the US were represented by the Democratic Party. This theory would explain the dramatic shift in vote choices and partisan representation of young men over the last decade, and it is boosted by the fact that both young men and young women swung to Republicans last year — despite those swings being uneven.

Outside of the US, it’s young voters who drove some of the surges of far-right and right-wing political parties across Europe in 2024. As the Atlantic’s Derek Thompson put it recently:

In France, Germany, Finland, and beyond, young voters are swinging their support toward anti-establishment far-right parties “in numbers equal to and even exceeding older voters.” In Germany, a 2024 survey of 2,000 people showed that young people have adopted a relatively new “gloomy outlook” on the future. No surprise, then, that the far-right Alternative für Deutschland has become the most popular party among Germans under 30. Like most interesting phenomena, this one even has a German name: Rechtsruck, or rightward shift.

Thompson points to political science research that has tracked a negative effect on trust in scientific authorities and political leaders as a result of pandemics and epidemics, particularly with those people between the ages of 18 and 25. Declining trust in American institutions — such as the Supreme Court, news media, the presidency, Congress, and big business — all make sense under this view.

The economics writer Kyla Scanlon argues something similar: that the youngest cohort of Gen Z faces a world of AI-driven disruption and institutional distrust and instability. They’re surrounded by echo chambers that feed their anxiety, and feel looser social connections. In response, they’re embracing more extreme, polarized identities and approaches to the economy and politics.

“Many younger Gen Zers came of age watching political gridlock, rising inequality, and a system that seemed increasingly detached from their lived reality. They saw institutions that refused to adapt (and as of recently, have shown a lack of resilience). They were locked inside during their formative years,” she argues, and so view reality much differently than even the older range of Gen Z.

In the context of the 2024 election, this theory explains why young Democrats in particular were so down on Joe Biden, and eventually distrustful of Harris and the establishment she came to represent. My own conversations with youth Democratic activists during the election cycle and in its aftermath brought forth many of the same takeaways — that young Democrats found themselves talking to young people who were distrustful of the status quo, of incumbents, and of an older generation of politicians promising change.

But while these explanations do a solid job explaining the overall shift of Gen Z, they’re less strong on explaining the dramatic lurch right by young men specifically.

Explanation No. 2: There’s something unique about Trump

Whether it was the issues Trump talked about, the salience of those issues to young people, or his campaign strategy and appeal to traditional masculinity, these candidate-specific factors are more persuasive in explaining how a group that reads more liberal on paper could be willing to swing so drastically to the right.

As Cox of AEI told me, “They’re Trump Republicans, they’re not [traditional] Republicans.” They hold much more progressive views on a range of issues, and are much less aligned with the traditional Republican orthodoxy than standard conservatives, but were Trump-curious, or felt less stigma in being open to voting for him.

Much of that was due to the media and messaging apparatus Trump and his allies built over the last year, specifically to reach young men. Whether through specific advertising, social media and influencer outreach on YouTube and TikTok, podcast interviews, or other campaign events, Trump saturated the feeds and platforms that young people, especially men, love to consume.

It worked. Trump posted his strongest gains with groups of young voters who fall into two buckets: those who prioritized the economy and “low-propensity” voters. That second category can be further divided into youth who were least interested or engaged with political news and youth who were voting for the first time.

These aren’t hardcore conservative, reactionary, or ideological voters. They’re just “not dug in when it comes to politics,” Cox told me. “You look at where young women are on gun control and climate change and reproductive health and LGBTQ rights, and they prioritize these things. Young men are less likely to prioritize any of them. They support some amount of gun control, they’re more pro-choice than pro-life, but it’s not that central to their politics or political identity.”

In other words, the Trump pitch was persuasive enough to win over a group that might have been destined to break with a Democratic Party that was using the wrong message to try to hold onto their support. But this explanation is unique to Trump and his personal brand and doesn’t necessarily apply to the Republican Party in general or to other Republican politicians.

Explanation No. 3: Democrats are doing something to turn off young men

If Trump was able to win over young men through his media presence and appeal to masculinity, it suggests Democrats failed to counter that influence — or even did something to make it worse.

Cox told me that beyond the specific candidates, there has been a general cultural drift of the Democratic Party’s identity, or perception, among young men that may be a missing piece. Beyond not being “masculine” enough or “too feminine,” there are cultural, class, and educational divides making it harder for the party to hang onto younger men — a party moving left faster than young men are.

“If you look back to George W. Bush and his affect — he went to Yale, he was from an elite pedigree, but he leaned into the blue-collar identity, going out and scrubbing brush and clearing land in his Texas ranch,” Cox said. “This was true then, and it’s more true now, but in an era where people don’t trust slick-talking politicians, the idea of someone using their hands for a living, or pretending to do so, is really resonant. It’s not just a gender gap, but an education divide.”

This education polarization — of Democrats becoming more of a party of wealthier and better-educated white voters — applies not just to its base, but to its leadership as well. When the messengers, and staffers, running campaigns and formulating the pitches to young voters look less like the people they are trying to reach, “you have just fewer people who are immersed in culturally conversant in ways that can help you craft a winning and effective political message,” he said.

That cultural shift among Democrats, which includes the party’s embrace of identity politics and progressive social justice-speak, Cox has found, has led to some serious branding problems with young men on a small but influential set of beliefs, specifically affirmative action, LGBTQ, and DEI policies.

“For young white men, their attitudes on various policies related to race are far more conservative than for young white women. There was a really significant divide in perceptions,” Cox said, about privilege and discrimination.

Here, a theory from Vice President JD Vance might actually speak to something that goes beyond ideology or partisanship. Speaking at CPAC last week, Vance argued that “our culture sends a message to young men that you should suppress every masculine urge … don’t allow this broken culture to send you a message that you’re a bad person because you’re a man, because you like to tell a joke, because you like to have a beer with your friends, or because you’re competitive.”

Young men, especially young white men, over the last 10 years, have grown to feel like underdogs as Democrats and the national culture moved to prioritize marginalized groups or minority communities, the Gen Z writer and strategist Rachel Janfaza explained in the fall. “The left has increasingly focused on uplifting marginalized groups — especially women. But the unintentional consequence of this focus has left young men feeling like no one is speaking to them and that there is no home for them in the Democratic Party.”

Stepping into that void are conventional voices like Vance’s or radical ones, like the podcaster Andrew Tate. “Young men are seeing these content creators, podcasters, even politicians, telling them that society is cutting white men out of the picture, or even just all men. And they point to DEI initiatives as this form of wokeness,” Cameron Kasky, a former March for Our Lives gun control and progressive activist, told me. “They say this is an attack on men and white men, and we gotta fight back” by offering alternative models of masculinity that put economic and educational opportunities first.

On that front, part of the Democratic issue in 2024 might have been that it did not offer an effective alternative “masculinity,” a pro-social, community-focused pitch shared by a credible messenger, instead of mocking young “bros” as “mediocre” or denying that young men feel more isolated.

“Multiple things can be true at once,” Gen Z Democratic strategist Annie Wu Henry told me about this relationship between progressive Democrats and young men last year. “We can acknowledge that white men have historically been the ones given the most privilege and power in society, while also not creating an environment where they feel completely alienated and then turn to spaces like the manosphere online — where they feel seen and accepted — but we also know lead to radicalization and validation of harmful viewpoints of other groups of people.”

Democrats did not offer an effective alternative “masculinity,” a pro-social, community-focused pitch shared by a credible messenger, instead of mocking young “bros” as “mediocre.”

To do that, Kasky says, “Democrats need to figure out how to get some swagger back,” and move beyond “Ivy League, fancy” communications.

Even something as small as making a tonal shift will be important. Trump’s favorability among young men, though still higher than with young women, is beginning to trend down, suggesting that last year’s rightward shift might be moderating already.

None of this has to be permanent

The fundamental point these theories all make is that none of these attitudes, shifts, or realignments are ironclad — some were specific to the post-pandemic moment, some to the peculiarities of specific candidates, and some to cultural shifts that seem to have stalled. And while voters’ attitudes and perceptions of political parties tend to get ironed out in their youth, this moment of ideological and identitarian tumult might be different.

Importantly for electoral politics and next year’s midterms, the 2024 results suggest that Trump benefited from a youth coalition that isn’t firmly Republican or consistently engaged in politics. The crossover support he received from young moderates and liberals, for example, might not come out to vote in a midterm election, or a non-Trump candidate. And many of their underlying beliefs are still liberal, or progressive on the issues.

“These are not your traditional GOP voters, so whether they come up for a GOP governor or a Senate candidate is very much an open question,” Cox said. “The idea that these voters are not winnable in 2026 and 2028 is crazy. They absolutely are, and I don’t see JD Vance being particularly appealing to them. So the Democratic Party should really think hard about those kinds of voters and the voters that they lost to Trump in 2024.”

But that Democratic soul-searching will likely create some tensions with other parts of their base and coalitions. Particularly because the most progressive or activist-minded members of the party feel ideologically committed to continue prioritizing minority groups, party leaders may be wary of catering to straight white men. But caring for this demographic will be necessary if they want to reverse Trump’s 2024 gains — and win future elections.",Left,True
Posts Spread False Claim About DOGE Halting Supposed Obamacare ‘Royalties’,https://www.allsides.com/news/2025-03-03-0453/facts-and-fact-checking-posts-spread-false-claim-about-doge-halting-supposed,FactCheck.org,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/factcheckorg-media-bias,Lean Left,https://www.factcheck.org/2025/02/posts-spread-false-claim-about-doge-halting-supposed-obamacare-royalties/,"Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino.

Quick Take

Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency have been tasked by President Donald Trump with slashing federal spending. But social media posts falsely claim that as part of that effort, DOGE stopped “royalties” to former President Barack Obama related to the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. The claim came from a satirical website.

Full Story

On Jan. 20, his first day in office, President Donald Trump established by executive order the new Department of Government Efficiency “to implement the President’s DOGE Agenda,” which has included efforts led by billionaire Elon Musk to reduce government spending and cut the federal payroll.

But as we’ve written, some of the claims made by DOGE and the Trump administration about overpayments in the Social Security system have been exaggerated, and some claims about spending by the U.S. Agency for International Development have been inaccurate or unsupported.

In recent days, some social media posts have repeated a fabricated claim that DOGE had halted millions in supposed royalty payments to former President Barack Obama.

A Feb. 27 Threads post falsely claimed, “DOGE stopped an annual payment to Barack Obama for $2.6 million for ‘royalties associated with Obamacare.’ He’s been collecting it since 2010, for a total of $39 million in taxpayer dollars.”

The posts are referring to the Affordable Care Act, the health care law enacted in 2010 under Obama that became known as Obamacare.

But the claim that the former president had been receiving royalty payments for the health care law he championed was the invention of America’s Last Line of Defense, or ALLOD, which publishes fabricated political stories and claims on its websites and social media pages that it describes as satirical. ALLOD posted the claim about Obama this month, and the image shared on social media included a stamp labeling the claim as satire.

The ALLOD website says, “Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined.”

The other social media posts sharing the claim did not identify the content as satire.

We could find no evidence that DOGE had stopped any payments to Obama, who as a former president does receive an annual pension payment from the government. Obama has received about $10.5 million from his presidential pension and other government benefits, such as travel and office space, since leaving the White House, The Hill reported. Since he left office at the end of his first term, Trump had received more than $3 million.
