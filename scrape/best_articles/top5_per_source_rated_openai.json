        "full_text": "Summary Trump says Ukraine ready for peace talks, cites Zelenskiy letter Trump says \"strong signals\" Russia ready for peace Trump, Zelenskiy say ready to sign minerals deal European allies pressured as U.S. shifts stance on Russia WASHINGTON/U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he received a letter from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in which the Ukrainian leader expressed willingness to come to the negotiating table over the Russia-Ukraine war . \"Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,\" Trump said in an address to Congress on Tuesday while quoting from the letter. Trump also said he had been in \"serious discussions with Russia\" and had \"received strong signals that they are ready for peace\". \"Wouldn't that be beautiful?\" he said. \"It's time to stop this madness. It's time to halt the killing. It's time to end this senseless war. If you want to end wars you have to talk to both sides.\" Trump was expected to further outline his plans for Ukraine and Russia in the speech to Congress , but did not reveal any further details on how he plans to end Europe's biggest conflict since World War Two. Trump said Ukraine was ready to sign a minerals deal with the U.S., which Washington says is crucial to secure continued U.S. backing for Ukraine's defense. Four sources told that the Trump administration and Ukraine plan to sign the deal in return for military aid, which Trump has paused. But later on Tuesday U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told , \"There is no signing planned,\" according to a post on X by a Fox reporter. Trump gave no further details on the minerals deal, leaving its fate unclear. Early on Tuesday, Zelenskiy pledged to repair relations with the U.S. after what he described as a \"regrettable\" Oval Office clash with Trump last week. Zelenskiy said he wanted to \"make things right\" and was ready \"any time and in any convenient format\" to sign the minerals deal, which he left on the table during a visit to Washington after the Oval Office argument with Trump. His statement came a day after Trump halted military aid to Ukraine, his latest move to upend U.S. policy and adopt a more conciliatory stance toward Russia. \"My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump\u2019s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts,\" Zelenskiy said in his statement on X. The statement made no mention of the pause in U.S. military supplies. Zelenskiy's statement was clearly aimed at stressing Kyiv's gratitude following the explosive confrontation at the White House, at which Trump and Vice President JD Vance scolded Zelenskiy as insufficiently appreciative. \"We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence,\" Zelenskiy wrote. \"Our meeting in Washington ... did not go the way it was supposed to be. It is regrettable that it happened this way. It is time to make things right.\" Zelenskiy outlined a path towards a peace agreement, which he said could begin with a release of prisoners and a halt to air and sea attacks, if Russia did the same. \"Then we want to move very fast through all next stages and to work with the U.S. to agree a strong final deal.\" U.S. President Donald Trump meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 28, 2025. /Brian Snyder/File Photo U.S. President Donald Trump meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 28, 2025. /Brian Snyder/File Photo , GEOPOLITICAL SHIFT Earlier, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukraine's forces could hold their own on the battlefield against Russian troops, but that Kyiv would do everything possible to continue cooperating with the U.S. \"We will continue to work with the U.S. through all available channels in a calm manner,\" Shmyhal said. \"We only have one plan - to win and to survive.\" In Moscow, the Kremlin said cutting off U.S. military aid to Ukraine was the best possible step towards peace, although it was waiting to confirm Trump's move. U.S. Democrats have raised an outcry over Trump's abrupt pivot towards Russia, the most dramatic geopolitical shift in generations for Washington, where governments under both parties since the 1940s have prioritized defending Europe from a hostile Moscow. The chart shows the five donors that have allocated the most bilateral aid to Ukraine across sectors between Jan. 24, 2022 to Dec. 31, 2024. PRESSURE ON EUROPE The pause in U.S. military aid puts more pressure on European allies who have publicly embraced Zelenskiy since the Oval Office blow-up. Britain and France, whose leaders both visited the White House last week, have offered troops to help guard a potential ceasefire. On Tuesday, Germany's conservatives and Social Democrats announced proposals to set up a 500 billion euro ($531 billion) fund to help ramp up defence spending. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen unveiled proposals to mobilise up to 800 billion euros for EU defence spending. The 27-nation bloc holds an emergency summit on Thursday. French President Emmanuel Macron's office said the president had spoken with both the U.S. and Ukrainian leaders and welcomed Zelenskiy's will to re-engage with Trump. But French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou was sharply critical of Trump's move to pause military supplies. \"Suspending aid during a war to a country under attack means abandoning the country under attack and accepting or hoping that the aggressor will win,\" he said during a parliamentary debate. Ukrainians were stunned and many described Washington's move as a betrayal. Oleksandr Merezhko, head of the Ukrainian parliament's foreign affairs committee, said it looked like Trump was \"pushing us towards capitulation\". \"Yes, it is betrayal, let's call it like it is,\" said lawyer Olena Bilova, 47, in Kyiv. \"But let's hope that American civil society and the elites of the European Union will not leave us alone.\" ($1 = 0.9418 euros) Editing by David Gregorio and Stephen Coates . , Erin Banco Thomson Erin Banco is a national security correspondent focusing on the intelligence community.

        "full_text": "Employees of the Hungarian radio station Klubradio work at its headquarters in Budapest, Hungary, February 6, 2025. /Bernadett Szabo Employees of the Hungarian radio station Klubradio work at its headquarters in Budapest, Hungary, February 6, 2025. /Bernadett Szabo , Summary USAID has helped fund independent media in eastern Europe Many outlets reeling from Trump actions against USAID They say loss of funds hits ability to hold power to account Hungary, Bosnia, Georgia among countries most impacted BUDAPEST/At a Feb. 10 editorial meeting of Hungarian investigative outlet Atlatszo, journalists discussed how they might raise money after their grants from USAID intermediaries were halted amid U.S. President Donald Trump's drive to shutter the agency. \"Without these funds it would be very hard to maintain independent media here (in Hungary),\" Atlatszo's managing editor Tamas Bodoky told , adding that they would seek new donors and try to increase crowdfunding. Atlatszo, a non-profit outlet set up in 2011, has published investigations on corruption, Hungarian oligarchs close to the government and the fate of EU funds, among other issues. Bodoky said USAID indirectly financed some 10-15% of its budget in 2023 and 2024. Trump's decision - first to freeze most funds disbursed by USAID for 90 days and put most of its staff on leave and then to ask billionaire Elon Musk to scale down the agency - has caused chaos for NGOs and humanitarian projects worldwide. While the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) distributes billions of dollars of humanitarian aid, it has also been involved in many other projects, including those aimed at strengthening civil society and democracy worldwide. USAID opened , new programmes in central Europe in late 2022, supporting locally-driven initiatives to bolster democratic institutions and independent media - much to the chagrin of Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a Trump ally who has welcomed the U.S. president's moves against the agency. Although the ultimate fate of many USAID programmes remains uncertain, the Trump administration has indicated it does not see supporting journalism in countries where rights groups say press freedom is limited as a good use of U.S. public funds. \"The US radical-left has been using US taxpayer money to fund radical-left political parties & media around the world,\u201d Musk wrote on X on January 29. Both Musk and Trump have branded USAID as \"corrupt\", without providing evidence. Trump's moves against USAID prompted Orban to say on February 7 that he wants to eliminate all \"foreign networks\" of NGOs and media critical of his government, fuelling fears that it will embolden him and other illiberal governments to enact clampdowns on media they deem to be unfriendly. \"Money from abroad cannot be allowed to influence Hungarian politics, and we shall enforce this legally, with those who are complicit in this facing legal consequences,\" said Orban, who faces a challenging election in 2026 amid a struggling economy. Orban has transformed Hungary's media landscape over the past 14 years. State media have been put under full government control and several private media outlets shut or taken over by government-friendly owners. Tight media control has helped Orban win the past three elections with a landslide. PRESS FREEDOM In 2024, Hungary ranked 67th on the World Press Freedom Index , , down from 23rd in 2010 when Orban took power, with its ranking well below that of Poland or the Czech Republic. Georgia and Bosnia - two other eastern European countries heavily impacted by Trump's efforts to dismantle USAID - ranked 103rd and 81st, respectively, for press freedom last year. The Sarajevo-based \"Umbrella\" association, a hub for 13 non-profit media involved in investigative journalism in the Balkans, is among organisations waiting to know if USAID donations will resume after Trump's 90-day financing freeze. \"If U.S. donations to media in Bosnia and Herzegovina were to be halted (permanently), some of them would be forced to reduce the scope of their work... cutting the number of serious stories about corruption, organised crime and abuse of power,\" said Umbrella director Milica Samardzic. Paulina Milewska, a researcher for the European University Institute in Florence, Italy, also cited the risk that media outlets that lose USAID funding will need to cut back on deeper coverage. While the U.S. government has long helped fund media organisations all over the world, eastern Europe has always been a major focus dating back to the Cold War, when the CIA helped establish outlets to sway public opinion against communism. Musk called on February 9 for the closure of Radio Free Europe (RFE) \u2013 which has been funded by U.S. government money separate to USAID since 1950 \u2013 saying it was a \"relic of the past\". In an emailed reply to , RFE declined to comment. After the USAID freeze, the European Federation of Journalists (EFJ) called on European institutions and foundations , to mobilise in support of media pluralism and independent journalism, saying Trump's move would cause \"chaos in the media ecosystem of over 30 countries around the world, including many European countries\". These include Georgia, where tens of thousands of people have been protesting for months against a government they see as pro-Russian and authoritarian and which has suspended negotiations to join the European Union. Among media outlets there affected by Trump's decision is English language news site OC-Media, which said it had lost funding for three USAID-backed projects. \"Without independent journalism, there will be no one to hold power to account,\" said its co-founder, Dominik Cagara.

        "full_text": "Summary Plaintiffs say Trump actions violate US law, Constitution Administration had asked US Supreme Court to intervene U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on Wednesday paused a federal judge's order requiring President Donald Trump 's administration to pay foreign aid funds to contractors and grant recipients. Roberts issued an interim order placing on hold Washington-based U.S. District Judge Amir Ali's action that had imposed a deadline of 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday night. Roberts provided no rationale for the order, known as an administrative stay, which will give the court additional time to consider the administration's more formal request to block Ali's ruling. Roberts asked for a response from the plaintiffs - organizations that contract with or receive grants from the U.S. Agency for International Development and the State Department - by noon on Friday. The order came after Trump's administration said in a court filing on Wednesday it had made final decisions terminating most U.S. foreign aid contracts and grants, while maintaining that it cannot meet Ali's court-ordered deadline. The administration is cutting more than 90% of the U.S. Agency for International Development's foreign aid contracts and over $58 billion in overall U.S. assistance around the world, a State Department spokesperson said separately, calling the cuts part of Trump's \"America First agenda.\" The foreign aid funding dispute arose from a pair of lawsuits brought by the aid organizations, alleging that the agencies have illegally frozen all foreign aid payments. The Trump administration has kept those payments largely frozen despite a February 13 temporary restraining order from Ali that they be released, and multiple subsequent orders that the administration comply, culminating in the Wednesday night deadline. Lawyers for the U.S. Justice Department have maintained that the administration has a right to suspend its agreements while it reviews them to determine whether they comply with administration policy. That review is now complete, the administration said in its new filing. It said USAID has made final decisions to cancel nearly 5,800 awards, while keeping more than 500, and that the State Department has canceled about 4,100 awards, while keeping about 2,700. An administration official said in an earlier court filing that grounds for terminating contracts include that they were related to diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility efforts, or were deemed wasteful. Trump has taken a hard line on programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion, signing an executive order in his second day in office last month directing federal agency chiefs to dismantle DEI policies . An American flag and USAID flag fly outside the USAID building in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 1, 2025. /Annabelle Gordon/File Photo , The administration said on Wednesday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had ordered that past-due invoices from the plaintiffs for work before January 24, when the payment freeze began, to be \"expedited for payment without the ordinary vetting procedures, in a good-faith effort to comply\" with Ali's order. It said that while some money would be paid on Wednesday, full payments could take weeks. FUNDING FREEZE UNDERMINES RELIEF EFFORTS Trump, a Republican, ordered a 90-day pause on all foreign aid on his first day in office last month. That order, and ensuing stop-work orders halting USAID operations around the world, have jeopardized the delivery of life-saving food and medical aid, throwing global humanitarian relief efforts into chaos . USAID administers some 60% of U.S. foreign assistance and disbursed $43.79 billion in fiscal 2023. According to a Congressional Research Service report this month, its workforce of 10,000, of which about two-thirds serves overseas, assisted about 130 countries. Trump's administration on Sunday said it was placing all but leaders and critical staff at USAID on paid administrative leave and eliminating 1,600 positions . Employee unions have sued to challenge the cuts, though a judge last week allowed them to go ahead . Ali, who was appointed by Trump's Democratic predecessor, former President Joe Biden, issued his temporary restraining order to prevent irreparable harm to the plaintiffs while he considers their claims. The plaintiffs allege Trump has exceeded his authority under federal law and the U.S. Constitution by effectively dismantling an independent agency and canceling spending authorized by Congress. The plaintiffs have said the administration has not done anything to comply with the restraining order, and some have said they will shut down within days if they are not paid. \"The lengths that the government is willing to go to flout a court order, all for the goal of ending life-saving humanitarian assistance, is staggering,\" said Allison Zieve, a lawyer representing two plaintiffs, AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and Journalism Development Network, on Wednesday. Other plaintiffs include international development company DAI Global and refugee assistance organization HIAS. Both Ali and a Rhode Island federal judge in a separate case over a broader federal payment freeze have castigated the Trump administration for failing to follow their orders. The administration in both cases has maintained it is trying in good faith to interpret and comply with the orders. editing by Leslie Adler, Stephen Coates and Michael Perry . , Brendan Pierson Thomson Brendan Pierson reports on product liability litigation and on all areas of health care law.

        "full_text": ", Summary Republicans, Democrats at odds over Trump spending cuts Both sides say they want to keep government funded until October With less than two weeks to go before a March 14 deadline, Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. Congress appear to be nowhere close to a deal to avert a government shutdown that would throw Washington into deeper turmoil. The talks have been complicated by President Donald Trump , who has ignored spending laws passed by Congress, suspended foreign aid and fired tens of thousands of federal workers. Both sides say his actions are the biggest sticking point as they seek to reach a deal that would provide government funding beyond March 14, when it is due to expire. Democrats say they are trying to secure guarantees that would prevent Trump and his budget-slashing point person, billionaire Elon Musk , from firing more workers or cancelling more government programs. \"We will continue to make clear that the law has to be followed,\" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters late last week. Republicans say Democrats are trying to undo Trump's actions, which they call a nonstarter. \"The bigger issue is the Democrats' insistence on putting poison pills into the bill that would restrict the president\u2019s abilities,\" Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine told reporters last week. Collins said she is \"very close\" to an agreement with Democrats that would fund the government at current levels through September 30, the end of the fiscal year. Trump has said on social media that he supports that approach. Democratic Senator Patty Murray of Washington said that would give Trump more power to shift funding as he pleases and would create shortfalls for some safety net programs. Both she and Collins have said a flat-line extension would also pose problems for the U.S. military at a time when the United States is confronting challenges from Russia, China and other parts of the world. The spending deal only covers a portion of the budget, funding agencies like the Department of Defense and the Environmental Protection Agency. It would not address the country's rising borrowing costs or rapidly growing benefit programs like Social Security and Medicare. Republicans are separately pushing to extend the tax cuts that Trump signed into law in 2017. One version, which narrowly passed the House last week, would cut taxes by $4.5 trillion and reduce spending by $2 trillion over a decade. Independent analysts say that would further add to the nation's $36 trillion debt load. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson said in a Sunday interview on 's \"Meet the Press\" that he was aiming to pass a stopgap funding bill. \"We are working hard to do our responsibility to keep the government open,\" said Johnson, of Louisiana. \"We need our Democrat colleagues to come to the table and be reasonable about that.\" Johnson leads a slim 218-215 majority and last year had to repeatedly turn to Democrats to pass legislation through his chamber, where a simple majority suffices. Democratic votes are needed to pass most bills in the Senate, where Republicans currently hold a 53-47 majority, short of the 60-vote threshold for most legislation. Trump's administration has made clear that its budget cutting efforts will continue. Officials last week ordered federal agencies to lay the groundwork for further layoffs, beyond the 100,000 who have already been fired or offered a buyout. The government employed 2.3 million civilian workers last year. Failure to reach a spending deal by March 14 would force the government to furlough hundreds of thousands of workers and shutter \"nonessential\" operations , such as financial regulation and trash pickup at national parks. The last government shutdown was also the longest, ending in January 2019 after 35 days, as Trump during his first term in office and lawmakers clashed over his effort to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. With no clear resolution in sight, lawmakers have already begun pointing fingers. \"Republicans have a responsibility to fund the government,\" Jeffries said last week, pointing out that Republicans control both chambers of Congress and the White House. Representative John Rutherford, a Florida Republican, said if Democrats vote against the \"clean\" extension of spending through September, \"they're the ones voting for the shutdown, not us.\" editing by Andy Sullivan and Chizu Nomiyama . , United States",

        "full_text": "Summary Car's driver arrested, police say No indications of religious or political motivation Suspect a German man who may have been psychologically unwell Germany on high alert for carnival season A car drove into a crowd in the western German city of Mannheim on Monday, killing at least two people and injuring 11 others, overshadowing carnival celebrations in the region where police had been on alert for attacks. Police detained the driver, who appeared to have ploughed intentionally into the crowd given the speed at which he was driving, prosecutors said in an act Interior Minister Nancy Faeser labeled \"horror in broad daylight\". He did not appear to have been politically or religiously motivated, but there were reasons to believe he was psychologically unwell, said Mannheim Chief Public Prosecutor Romeo Schluessler. Prosecutors have initiated investigative proceedings against the suspect, a 40-year-old German man from the neighbouring state of Rhineland-Palatinate, on two counts of murder and multiple counts of attempted murder. The suspect has not been questioned yet as he had to undergo medical treatment after shooting himself in the mouth with a blank-firing gun after the attack. He appeared to be a landscape gardener who lived alone, prosecutors said, adding that they were now investigating his home for clues. Security has been a key concern in Germany following a string of violent attacks in recent weeks, including deadly car rammings in Magdeburg in December and in Munich last month, as well as a stabbing in Mannheim in May 2024. \"The incident \u2014 like the terrible acts of the past months \u2014 serves as a stark reminder: we must do everything possible to prevent such acts,\" said Germany's likely next leader, Friedrich Merz, whose conservatives won a national election last month. \"Germany must once again become a safe country. We will work with full determination to achieve this.\" Police officers work at the site where a car drove into a crowd, in Mannheim, Germany, March 3, 2025. /Heiko Becker Police officers work at the site where a car drove into a crowd, in Mannheim, Germany, March 3, 2025. /Heiko Becker , Messages of solidarity were sent from across Europe. \"To all the people of Mannheim, especially to all the relatives of the victims of the attack, to the German people. France is at your side,\" French President Emmanuel Macron wrote on the social media platform X. Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said \"attempts to destabilize democratic nations will not prevail\". The two who died were an 83-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man. NERVOUS CARNIVAL Police were on high alert for this year's carnival parades after social media accounts linked to the Islamic State militant group called for attacks on the events in Cologne and Nuremberg. There did not appear to be a connection between Monday's incident and the carnival celebrations, the interior minister of the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Thomas Strobl, told reporters. Those festivities culminated on Rose Monday with a number of parades, although not in Mannheim, which held its main event on Sunday. Rose Monday, the culmination of the annual carnival season celebrated in Germany's mainly Catholic western and southern regions, features parades of floats that often include comical or satirical references to current affairs. This year's carnival has included floats featuring U.S. President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin, tech billionaire Elon Musk and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Dressed in traditional jester costumes and sporting colourful makeup, thousands of partygoers danced through the streets of Cologne, Dusseldorf and other cities in western and southern Germany ahead of the fasting season of Lent.

The announcement followed days of tense negotiations between the US and Ukraine in which Zelenskyy alleged the US was pressuring him to sign a deal worth more than $500bn that would force \u201cten generations\u201d of Ukrainians to pay it back.\n\nTrump reinstated a rule requiring cost transparency in healthcare. The rule requires hospitals to publish online the prices for some of their most common services, including MRI scans and caesarean section deliveries. The lack of transparency has often left patients shocked by medical bills.\n\nTrump signed an executive order instructing the commerce secretary to launch an investigation into whether foreign copper production and imports threaten US economic and national security. According to White House officials, the investigation could lead to new tariffs on foreign copper, a material essential to manufacturing and construction, as well as critical to the US military and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence.\n\n\u2018More than one million\u2019 federal workers have responded to Elon Musk/Doge\u2019s ultimatum email, the White House has claimed. Trump\u2019s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, also said agency heads will \u201cdetermine the best practices\u201d for dealing with the \u2018what did you do last week\u2019 email in terms of whether people should respond and who, if anyone, would get fired. News reported that responses to the email will reportedly be fed into an artificial intelligence system to determine whether their jobs are necessary.\n\nIn a significant shift of journalistic power, the White House press team will now decide which journalists and media outlets will make up the White House press pool. Leavitt said legacy outlets will still be allowed to join and participate in the press pool, but the \u201cprivilege\u201d will also be extended to \u201cnew voices\u201d from \u201cwell-deserving outlets\u201d. It builds on the decision to revoke the \u2019s full access to presidential events over its continued use of \u201cGulf of Mexico\u201d as opposed to \u201cGulf of America\u201d.\n\nSome 40% of the federal contracts the Trump administration claims to have canceled as part of its signature cost-cutting program aren\u2019t expected to save the government any money, the administration\u2019s own data shows. Doge last week published an initial list of 1,125 contracts that it terminated in recent weeks across the federal government. Data published on Doge\u2019s \u201cwall of receipts\u201d shows that more than one-third of the contract cancellations, 417 in all, are expected to yield no savings.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 20 civil service employees resigned from Doge, saying they were refusing to use their technical expertise to \u201cdismantle critical public services. \u201cWe swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the constitution across presidential administrations,\u201d the 21 staffers wrote in a joint resignation letter, a copy of which was obtained by the . \u201cHowever, it has become clear that we can no longer honor those commitments.\u201d\n\nA federal judge in Seattle blocked the Trump administration\u2019s effort to halt the nation\u2019s refugee admissions system. US district judge Jamal Whitehead said in his ruling after the hearing on Tuesday that the president\u2019s actions amounted to an \u201ceffective nullification of congressional will\u201d in setting up the nation\u2019s refugee admissions program. \u201cThe president has substantial discretion ... to suspend refugee admissions,\u201d Whitehead told the parties. \u201cBut that authority is not limitless.\u201d\n\nA US judge extended an order blocking the Trump administration from instituting a sweeping freeze on trillions of dollars in federal funding by pausing grants, loans and other financial support. US district judge Loren AliKhan in Washington wrote that while some funds had become unfrozen since she first temporarily blocked the administration\u2019s spending pause, there remained a risk the administration might again try to shut off funding. The judge said for those reasons she agreed with groups representing nonprofits and small business that a preliminary injunction was necessary blocking a further funding freeze.\n\nA federal judge in Washington has ordered the Trump administration to pay foreign aid funds to contractors and grant recipients by 11.59pm on Wednesday night, saying there was no sign that it had taken any steps to comply with his earlier order that the funds be unfrozen.\n\nThe Senate confirmed Daniel Driscoll, an Iraq war veteran and adviser to JD Vance, as secretary of the army.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 03.51 CET\n\nThe tax cut proposals in this GOP budget blueprint passed on Tuesday center on $4.5tn in tax breaks, which would extend the tax cuts Trump implemented during his first term.\n\nThese tax cuts are currently set to expire later this year and the proposed package aims to prolong them. But the details of how these tax breaks would be structured haven\u2019t been specified yet.\n\nTrump\u2019s tax cuts helped billionaires massively during his first term, with the richest families in the US paying a lower tax rate than the working class for the first time in history in 2018.\n\nSeveral lawmakers are concerned that the proposed cuts \u2013 especially the $880bn over the next decade assigned to the committee overseeing healthcare spending, including Medicaid, and the $230bn allocated to the agriculture committee responsible for food stamps \u2013 could hinder their constituents back home.\n\n\u201cThe House Republican budget will make people sicker and poorer,\u201d said Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committee. \u201cIt will force even more families to live paycheck to paycheck while giving the wealthiest Americans a windfall big enough to buy a new private jet.\u201d\n\nNext steps involve weeks of committee hearings to draft the full legislative text, as well as negotiations with the Senate, where Republicans have their own scaled-back version.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 03.25 CET\n\nUndocumented immigrants in the US who fail to register with the federal government could face fines, imprisonment, or both, according to a directive issued Tuesday by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration will enforce all our immigration laws \u2013 we will not pick and choose which laws we will enforce,\u201d a DHS spokesperson said. \u201cWe must know who is in our country for the safety and security of our homeland and all Americans.\u201d\n\nAccording to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services website, all immigrants over the age of 14 who were not fingerprinted or registered when applying for a US visa and who remain in the country for 30 days or longer must register and be fingerprinted.\n\nOnce registered and fingerprinted, DHS will provide evidence of registration, which immigrants over the age of 18 are required to carry at all times.\n\nLast month, upon returning to office, Donald Trump declared illegal immigration at the US-Mexico border a national emergency and directed DHS to ensure that immigrants register with the federal government.\n\nThe administration is also working to end the Biden-era CBP One entry program, which allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants to legally enter the US by scheduling appointments through an app.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 03.08 CET\n\nTrump-forward budget proposal imperiling Medicaid narrowly passes in Republican-led House\n\nThe House narrowly passed the budget resolution by a 217-215 vote after an intense push by Mike Johnson, the speaker, and Donald Trump.\n\nThe budget plan includes an estimated $800bn in potential cuts from Medicaid, a federal program providing healthcare coverage to more than 72 million Americans. The resolution also includes a $4.5tn in tax cuts and increased funding for defense and border security, offset by $2tn in spending reductions over the next decade.\n\nThe budget measure needed to pass by the 14 March deadline or risk a government shutdown.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 02.57 CET\n\nThe Social Security Administration said on Tuesday that it dissolved its office of civil rights and equal opportunity, and its employees will be put on administrative leave as of today.\n\nLee Dudek, Social Security\u2019s acting commissioner, said in a statement that terminating the civil rights office \u201cadvances the President\u2019s goal to make all of government more efficient in serving the American public\u201d.\n\nThe agency\u2019s office of civil rights and equal opportunity is responsible for planning and implementing programs designed to ensure equal opportunity in employment for all employees regardless of race, color, national origin, etc., according to its webpage.\n\nSSA says it will transfer responsibility for processing civil rights complaints and reasonable accommodation requests to other agency offices \u201cto ensure compliance with existing legal authorities\u201d.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 02.56 CET\n\nNearly 6,000 veterans have been fired across the federal government since the start of Trump\u2019s term, according to a new analysis by House Democrats.\n\nLauren Gambino\n\nThe report, compiled from data provided by the office of personnel management, estimates that roughly 38,000 federal workers have been fired since Trump took office last month and empowered Elon Musk\u2019s \u2018efficiency\u2019 agency to dramatically reduce the federal workforce.\n\n\u201cOur veterans make significant sacrifices in service of our country, but those sacrifices do not seem to matter to President Trump and unchecked billionaire Elon Musk,\u201d Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, ranking member of the House appropriations committee, said in a statement. \u201cThey are an essential part of our federal workforce, bringing their expertise to every single agency. Republicans are turning their back on them, allowing Musk to fire at least 6,000 veterans and leave them with no way to feed their families or keep a roof over their heads.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have countered that the cuts are a necessary part of a long-overdue effort to root out government waste and inefficiency.\n\nThe federal government is the largest US employer of veterans, who comprise about 30% of the workforce.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 02.55 CET\n\nTrump says Zelenskyy set to visit White House on Friday to sign minerals deal\n\nAndrew Roth\n\nDonald Trump has said that Volodymyr Zelenskyy is likely to visit the White House on Friday to sign a rare earth minerals deal to pay for US military aid to defend against Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion.\n\nThe announcement followed days of tense negotiations between the US and Ukraine in which Zelenskyy alleged the US was pressuring him to sign a deal worth more than $500bn that would force \u201cten generations\u201d of Ukrainians to pay it back.\n\nMedia outlets reported late on Tuesday that the terms of an agreement had been reached.\n\n\u201cI hear that he\u2019s coming on Friday,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \u201cCertainly it\u2019s OK with me if he\u2019d like to.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, which first reported the deal, the new terms of the deal did not reportedly include the onerous demands for a right to $500bn in potential revenue from exploiting the resources, which include rare earth metals and Ukrainian oil and gas resources.\n\nA framework for the deal included joint ownership of a fund to develop Ukraine\u2019s mineral resources with certain caveats for those resources already contributing to the state budget.\n\nMore on the story here:\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 03.10 CET\n\nMichael Sainato\n\n\u2019s labor reporter, Michael Sainato, spoke to USAid workers who are expected to be \u2018escorted\u2019 back to the office to collect their belongings amid Trump\u2019s bid to shut down the foreign aid agency.\n\nStaff who spoke to sounded the alarm over the impact of these moves on global security, warning that closing USAid and withdrawing foreign aid is \u201conly leaving war on the table\u201d.\n\nThe agency is \u201cthe canary in the coal mine\u201d as Trump seeks to test the limits of his executive powers, said one USAid official, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation and harassment. \u201cWe see us as the most acute and boldest example of overreach, that checks and balances ought to restrain the powers of the president and the president should abide by the powers of Congress and the courts.\n\n\u201cCan the president act like a king? We\u2019re a glaring flare for all of those things.\u201d\n\nThe agency has been subjected to attacks and conspiracy theories about its work, with Elon Musk and his supporters making false claims about funding, including a baseless claim about the agency sending $50m to Gaza for condoms, and false claims about grants such as the suggestion by the so-called \u201cdepartment of government efficiency\u201d that $21m had been sent to India to influence elections.\n\nMusk has called the agency \u201ca criminal organization\u201d and argued that it was \u201ctime for it to die\u201d. Pushed on his false condoms claim earlier this month, he responded: \u201cSome of the things I say will be incorrect.\u201d\n\nHealth clinics reliant on USAid grants in Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, Iraq and other countries around the world have been forced to shut down and international aid groups have already cut thousands of jobs due to the funding freeze.\n\nThe Trump administration is fighting challenges in court to freeze all USAid funding, place nearly all employees on leave.\n\n\u201cUSAid was established by act of Congress. It needs to be un-established by act of Congress. They are ignoring that rule,\u201d the USAid official said. \u201cI would guess around 500 workers, no one has provided specifics, senior leaders, HR and IT people, are left behind to participate in the dismantling of the agency.\u201d\n\nContracts and grants are still being cut and terminated, with only a small fraction of the agency\u2019s work abroad still continuing, they said. \u201cWe\u2019re a lifesaving agency. They certainly have done damage that will take years to undo, but even though they\u2019ve closed the building and banned us from it, we\u2019re not done.

Inflation and a significant increase in mentions of trade and tariffs were the top concerns for respondents to the board\u2019s survey.\n\nThe group\u2019s consumer confidence index plummeted this month to 98.3 from 105.3 in January. That\u2019s far below the expectations of economists, who projected a reading of 103, according to a survey by FactSet.\n\nThe proportion of consumers expecting a recession over the next year jumped to a nine-month high, the board said.\n\nConsumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of US economic activity and is closely watched by economists for signs about how the American consumer is feeling.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 01.52 CET\n\nMarina Dunbar\n\nTrump\u2019s Iron Dome for America system is now reportedly called Golden Dome\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s Iron Dome for America initiative for a missile defense system protecting US skies from attack has been reportedly renamed the Golden Dome for America.\n\nIn a video published on Thursday, secretary of defense Pete Hegseth referred to the project as \u201cthe Golden Dome or Iron Dome\u201d. A defense official confirmed shortly after that the name of the initiative has been officially changed to \u201cGolden Dome\u201d, according to military news website Defense One.\n\nA spokesperson for Space Force did not respond to a Guardian query on the possible name change.\n\nThe idea of a new name comes as a team of technical experts has been assembled by the US Space Force to determine which programs can help build out the initiative.\n\nThe Iron \u2013 or perhaps now Golden \u2013 Dome for America executive order, signed by Trump on 27 January, is a directive for Hegseth to submit a comprehensive plan that details an implementation strategy, including the required architecture, for a missile defense system.\n\nTrump is known for his grand renaming of things, including the Gulf of Mexico, which is now known officially in the US as the Gulf of America, as well as having a gaudy taste for golden and luxurious decorations, such as that which often adorn his apartments and buildings like Trump Tower in New York.\n\nThe defense system focuses heavily on the concept of space-based sensors and interceptors. The company that currently dominates the market for such equipment is the Elon Musk-owned SpaceX, leading to concerns that this project is another way for Musk to make money from federal programs.\n\nRead the full story here:\n\nShare\n\nJohn Thune, the Senate majority leader, is defending the Trump administration\u2019s cuts to federal workers and programs, calling them a long overdue \u201cscrub\u201d of the federal government.\n\nStill, the Republican from South Dakota acknowledged that the reductions are affecting the home states of GOP senators.\n\n\u201cI think we all understand that this government, the federal government, is long in need of the kind of scrub that is being done to figure out how we can do things better,\u201d Thune said at the Capitol.\n\nHe said that senators would make the Trump administration aware if programs, such as those that impact health and safety, are at risk.\n\nShare\n\nThe Trump administration plans to cut employees at the US Department of Housing and Urban Development who assist officials and citizens in navigating government housing programs, the reports.\n\nThese cuts are among the first steps in the administration\u2019s broader plan to reduce HUD\u2019s workforce by half.\n\nThe field policy and management division is expected to lose at least 145 employees \u2013 about 40% of its staff \u2013 by 18 May.\n\nA memo from the HUD secretary Scott Turner, dated Monday, states that all positions within the office at a certain pay grade and below \u201care being abolished\u201d.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 00.04 CET\n\nTrump reinstates rule on healthcare cost transparency\n\nTrump reinstated a rule requiring cost transparency in healthcare.\n\nThe rule requires hospitals to publish online the prices for some of their most common services, including MRI scans and caesarean section deliveries.

        "full_text": "A pipeline company\u2019s victory in court over Greenpeace, and the huge damages it now faces, will encourage other oil and gas companies to legally pursue environmental protesters at a time when Donald Trump\u2019s energy agenda is in ascendancy, experts have warned.\n\nOn Wednesday a North Dakota jury ruled that three Greenpeace entities collectively must pay Energy Transfer, which was co-founded by a prominent Trump donor, more than $660m, deciding that the organizations were liable for defamation and other claims after a five-week trial in Mandan, near where the Dakota Access pipeline protests occurred in 2016 and 2017.\n\n\u201cThis verdict will embolden other energy companies to take legal action against protesters who physically block their projects,\u201d said Michael Gerrard, the founder and faculty director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School.\n\n\u201cIt will chill those kinds of protests; whether the chilling goes beyond that remains to be seen. It won\u2019t inhibit litigation against fossil fuel projects; we will surely see more of those as the Trump administration advances its \u2018drill, baby, drill\u2019 agenda.\u201d\n\nKevin Cramer, the US senator from North Dakota, cheered Wednesday\u2019s huge judgment against Greenpeace over the pipeline protests in his state, congratulating the energy company who sued the environmental group for its big win.\n\nJustice was served, he said. \u201cThey can think twice now about doing it again,\u201d he said of Greenpeace and other environmental groups who protested against the Dakota Access pipeline.\n\nBrian Hauss, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU\u2019s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, said that the lawsuit served as a \u201ctax on speech\u201d, one that makes it too expensive to go against \u201clitigious, deep-pocketed corporations\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf companies can sue critics, advocates and protesters into oblivion for their speech and the unlawful acts of third parties, then no one will feel safe protesting corporate malfeasance,\u201d Hauss said.\n\nIn the days since the ruling was issued, environmental groups and protest movements have reacted with shock and dismay, warning that its impact stretches far beyond any individual organization.\n\nAmnesty International said the \u201cdevastating verdict sets an array of deeply damaging precedents on the rights to freedom of speech, association and peaceful protest and puts the very future of Greenpeace at risk\u201d.\n\nSome legal experts were surprised the case even made it before a jury. Similar claims often get tossed out over first amendment concerns or because many states prevent so-called Slapp suits (strategic lawsuits against public participation). North Dakota doesn\u2019t have an anti-Slapp law.\n\nGreenpeace\u2019s goals \u2013 such as protecting the climate and preserving oceans \u2013 won\u2019t change, said Sushma Raman, the interim executive director of Greenpeace USA. But \u201cit\u2019s really going to be a question of capacity and prioritization, which happens in any organization that is facing an existential threat of this kind,\u201d Raman said.\n\n\u201cUltimately, this isn\u2019t about the money for them,\u201d Raman said of Energy Transfer. \u201cIt\u2019s really about sending a message, and it\u2019s trying to silence an organization that they feel is a thorn in their side.\u201d\n\nEnergy Transfer\u2019s CEO, Kelcy Warren, has donated millions to pro-Trump groups and given directly to the president\u2019s campaigns over the years. He has made a mission of going after pipeline opponents, including Greenpeace, filing several lawsuits to that end.\n\nSome conservatives have celebrated his approach. Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, said it was \u201cgreat news!\u201d that the verdict could bankrupt Greenpeace. Erick Erickson, a conservative talkshow host, said Warren was his hero. \u201cI\u2019m a longtime shareholder of Energy Transfer and his campaign to destroy Greenpeace has been awesome to behold. God bless him,\u201d Erickson wrote on X.\n\nShayana \u201cShane\u201d Kadidal, a senior managing attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, called to mind economic boycotts during the US civil rights movement that inflicted damage on white-owned businesses, and how those businesses retaliated with civil lawsuits against groups such as the NAACP, trying to frame their activism as a conspiracy.\n\n\u201cBillionaire oligarchs like Elon Musk and Energy Transfer\u2019s Kelcy Warren now pose one of the most significant risks to free speech globally,\u201d Kadidal said.\n\nGreenpeace began in the 1970s with a campaign led by Canadian activists to block nuclear weapons testing on an Alaskan island, its roots based in direct action. US offshoots grew throughout that decade. It is headquartered in the Netherlands, where it has filed an anti-Slapp lawsuit against Energy Transfer.\n\nIt has said it got involved in the Dakota Access protests because the tribe, the Standing Rock Sioux, asked for its help. The organization has a policy of only getting involved in Indigenous-led movements if specifically asked, the New York Times reported.\n\nWaniya Locke, of Standing Rock Grassroots, said the verdict \u201cattempts to erase Indigenous leadership from Standing Rock\u2019s history\u201d and part of a \u201ccoordinated attack on communities organizing to protect their water and futures from big oil\u201d.\n\nThe Greenpeace case isn\u2019t the only recent example of a heightened legal attack on free speech. Protesters on US college campuses have been met with disciplinary actions for supporting Palestinian human rights, the most extreme example involving the push to deport a former Columbia student, Mahmoud Khalil. Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, has sued his critics.\n\nThe International Center for Not-for-Profit Law has tracked a rise in anti-protest bills since 2017, corresponding with major protest movements including actions against pipelines, on college campuses, for teachers and for racial justice. These proposals include \u201cextreme\u201d penalties for protest-related offenses like trespassing near a pipeline, the center notes in its analysis. They also call for expanded liability for organizations or individuals that aren\u2019t directly involved in protests. \u201cNon-profits, religious groups, and others will be much more reluctant to support or organize protected protests if they face possible penalties for the unlawful actions of others,\u201d the center said in its analysis.\n\nThe verdict is not the end for this case \u2013 Greenpeace has said it will appeal to the North Dakota supreme court. Legal experts believe the organization has a better shot on appeal, citing the jury\u2019s ties to the oil and gas industry and the broad disapproval of the protest among local residents.\n\nIn the defeat, there has also been resolve.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t sue or bankrupt a movement,\u201d Raman said.",

        "full_text": "Greenland\u2019s prime minister, M\u00fate B Egede, has called for the international community to step in after it was announced that Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser and the US second lady will visit the Arctic island, accusing Washington of \u201cforeign interference\u201d.\n\nMike Waltz and Usha Vance are due to arrive in Greenland this week as part of a delegation that will also include the US energy secretary, Chris Wright.\n\nTrump has pledged to make the autonomous territory \u2013 part of the kingdom of Denmark, which ruled Greenland as a colony until 1953 and continues to control its foreign and security policy \u2013 part of the US, \u201cone way or the other\u201d and has refused to rule out using military or economic force to do so.\n\nA spokesperson for the Danish police said they had sent extra personnel and sniffer dogs to Greenland as they step up security measures before the visit. Ren\u00e9 Gyldensten said the extra officers, deployed on Sunday, were part of regular steps taken during visits by dignitaries but declined to specify the number of extra police flown in on a chartered aircraft. News reports put the figure at dozens.\n\nGreenlandic parties are currently in coalition talks after an election less than a fortnight ago in which the country voted for a complete overhaul of its government, with the Democrats replacing Egede\u2019s party, Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA), as the biggest party in the Inatsisartut, the Greenlandic parliament.\n\nEgede reacted angrily to the White House announcement on Sunday, accusing Greenland\u2019s allies of \u201chiding\u201d and \u201calmost whispering\u201d their support. If the international community did not step up its support for Greenland, he warned, the situation would escalate.\n\n\u201cYes, the western allies stood together and helped each other through thick and thin, but it has turned upside down now with the sitting president in the USA,\u201d he told the Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq.\n\n\u201cBut the fact that our other allies in the international community feel like hiding in a small corner and almost whispering that they support us has no effect, and if they do not speak out loudly about how the USA is treating Greenland, the situation will escalate day by day, and the American aggression will increase.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cSo we need our other allies to clearly and distinctly come with their support and backing for us.\u201d\n\nJens-Frederik Nielsen, the leader of Greenland\u2019s Democrats, who is expected to become the next prime minister, called for calm and said they would continue to take the time needed to reach a \u201csolid and sustainable political agreement\u201d. He accused the US of a \u201clack of respect\u201d in planning the visit while coalition talks were still happening.\n\n\u201cThe visit, which is said to be \u2018private\u2019, is pure charm offensive, and if we allow ourselves to be influenced by it, for example by rushing to form a new coalition, we may become even more vulnerable to pressure,\u201d Nielsen told Sermitsiaq.\n\n\u201cSo let\u2019s cool our nerves and maintain our common goal of showing the outside world that our country is not a commodity, and that we have sovereignty over the country, which must be respected and no one can take it away from us.\u201d\n\nThe Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said on Sunday that the planned visit \u201ccannot be seen independently of the public statements that have been made\u201d. She added: \u201cIn the kingdom, we want to cooperate with the Americans. But it must be a cooperation that is based on the fundamental values \u200b\u200bof sovereignty and respect between countries and peoples \u2026\n\n\u201cThis is something we are looking at seriously. The dialogue with the US regarding Greenland will take place in close coordination between the Danish government and the future Greenlandic government.\u201d\n\nAnnouncing the trip on Sunday, the second lady\u2019s office said Vance would visit Greenland together with her son and a US delegation from Thursday to Saturday this week. The White House later announced that Waltz and Wright would visit the US military base in Greenland, Pituffik, for briefings from US personnel. They are expected to join Vance to visit historical sites and attend a dog sled race.",

        "full_text": "Fired USAid employees and advocates for people with HIV staged a protest in a Capitol office building on Wednesday, warning that Donald Trump\u2019s drive to dismantle the agency tasked with implementing Washington\u2019s foreign aid agenda imperils the fight against the virus.\n\nWearing white T-shirts that read \u201cAids funding cuts kill\u201d and chanting \u201cCongress has blood on its hands, unfreeze aid now\u201d, around three dozen protesters lay down in the rotunda of the Cannon House office building, home to the offices of representatives from both parties. Capitol police said about 20 arrests were made of demonstrators who defied their orders to disperse.\n\n\u201cWhat we are demanding of Congress is that they stop behaving like doormats in the face of this attack on humanitarian assistance that truly is highly effective and life-saving,\u201d Asia Russell, executive director of Health Gap, a global advocacy group fighting against HIV, said prior to the protest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to overstate what\u2019s at stake regarding humanitarian assistance.\u201d\n\nThe protest came as USAid remained frozen by the Trump administration\u2019s rapid moves to close the agency. Over the weekend, the agency announced that it was placing all but a small number of its employees worldwide, as well as nearly 2,000 staffers based in the United States, on paid leave. Those working in Washington DC have been invited to retrieve their belongings from its headquarters, which is set to be turned into office space for US Customs and Border Protection, one of the agencies implementing Trump\u2019s hardline immigration policies.\n\nOn Tuesday, a federal judge reportedly gave the government a two-day deadline to release billions of dollars in foreign aid funds that had been held back after Trump ordered USAid to stop work. If those funds are not restored, former USAid employees who attended the protest at the Capitol warned, the global fight against HIV will be set back.\n\nThe United States has been a leader in the campaign against the virus that causes Aids through Pepfar, a program that provides medication to 20 million people worldwide and was established during Republican George W Bush\u2019s presidency. But USAid\u2019s abrupt closure has stopped payments to providers working with the program worldwide.\n\n\u201cThis is not controversial, and what is happening is not government efficiency, it\u2019s government fraud, waste and abuse when it comes to what Doge is doing,\u201d said the fired USAid contractor Van Credle, referring to Elon Musk\u2019s so-called \u201cdepartment of government efficiency\u201d, which spearheaded the dismantling of her agency as well as other deep cuts to federal services.\n\nThe Republican majorities elected to both the Senate and House last November have thus far shown little interest in saving USAid and even supported its closure, despite the fact that foreign assistance has in the past enjoyed support on both sides of the aisle. Kelsey Crow, a contractor at the agency\u2019s bureau of global health who lost her job, said the protest was meant to encourage lawmakers who previously supported USAid to step up.\n\n\u201cSo much of our work at USAid is mandated by Congress, and so for Congress to not be taking action, for Congress to be holding hearings that are pushing out lies and falsehoods about USAid to say that the waivers are back when we know that they\u2019re actually not turned on and the money\u2019s not actually flowing, it\u2019s incredibly disappointing,\u201d Crow said.\n\nPeter Kerndt, a physician who spent five years with USAid coordinating the fight against tuberculosis in African and Asian countries, said it will be \u201cimpossible\u201d to achieve a global goal of eliminating the virus by 2030 if the agency goes away.\n\n\u201cFor this administration, for Elon Musk to call USAid a criminal organization that should die and to gleefully celebrate that he spent the weekend putting USAid in the wood chipper instead of going to a party is such an insult to all of the workers, both here and in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cBut most of all, the people that suffer are the people that we were there to help.\u201d\n\nAndrew Roth contributed reporting",

        "full_text": "Consumer prices remained relatively stable in February even as some economists have warned that prices could rise again amid Donald Trump\u2019s trade war and stock markets have fallen on fears of a recession.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics latest Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks the prices of a range of goods and services, the annualized inflation in February was 2.8%, a 0.2% decrease from January\u2019s year-over-year rate of 3%. The month-by-month price increase for all goods minus the volatile food and energy industries was 0.2%, compared with January\u2019s 0.4%.\n\nThe egg shortage caused by the avian flu outbreak drove egg prices up 10.4% in February. Meanwhile, energy prices cooled a bit, rising 0.2% in February compared with 1.1% in January.\n\nWhile inflation has declined sharply from its peak just above 9% in 2022, price increases have remained above the Federal Reserve\u2019s target rate of 2%. The closest inflation has gotten to the target rate was in September, when inflation hit 2.4%.\n\nThe Fed had spent the last few years adjusting interest rates in an attempt to gently lower inflation without hurting the labor market. At the end of last year, it seemed as if the Fed would achieve the so-called \u201csoft landing\u201d: prices were coming down, and the unemployment rate remained relatively low at around 4%. The Fed lowered interest rates three times last year. The central bank meets next week and is expected to leave rates unchanged.\n\nBut the slow and steady recovery from the inflationary heights reached after the Covid pandemic has been jolted by Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House. The president has stuck to his campaign promise to use tariffs against the US\u2019s key trading partners, arguing they have taken advantage of the US and done too little to halt the flow of illegal drugs into the country.\n\nSo far, he has tacked on an extra 20% tariff on all imports from China and 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum exports from Canada. Threats of other tariffs, including a 25% tariff on all imports from Mexico and Canada, are still up in the air.\n\nThe instability of Trump\u2019s trade policies has rocked US stock markets, which has cratered downwards over the last week.\n\nThe White House has batted away warnings that reactionary trade policies could destabilize the economy and even cause a recession. Wall Street went down even further on Monday, after Trump didn\u2019t rule out a possible recession, saying on Sunday that the country is in \u201ca period of transition, because what we\u2019re doing is very big\u201d.\n\nThe Fed chair, Jerome Powell, has all but directly confirmed that the central bank will hold rates steady at its next meeting, on 18-19 March. In prepared remarks on 7 March, Powell said that the \u201ccosts of being cautious are very, very low\u201d given that the economy is in a stable place \u2013 for now.\n\n\u201cThe economy\u2019s fine. It doesn\u2019t need us to do anything, really. And so we can wait, and we should wait,\u201d Powell said.\n\nTaking pains to avoid any overtly political statements, Powell said that there is \u201cheightened uncertainty about the economic outlook\u201d but \u201cit remains to be seen how these developments might affect future spending and investment\u201d.",

        "full_text": "Cybertrucks set ablaze. Bullets and Molotov cocktails aimed at Tesla showrooms.\n\nAttacks on property carrying the logo of Elon Musk\u2019s electric-car company are cropping up across the U.S. and overseas. While no injuries have been reported, Tesla showrooms, vehicle lots, charging stations and privately owned cars have been targeted.\n\nThere\u2019s been a clear uptick since President Donald Trump took office and empowered Musk to oversee a new Department of Government Efficiency that\u2019s slashing government spending. Experts on domestic extremism say it\u2019s impossible to know yet if the spate of incidents will balloon into a long-term pattern.\n\nIn Trump\u2019s first term, his properties in New York, Washington and elsewhere became a natural place for protest. In the early days of his second term, Tesla is filling that role.\n\n\u201cTesla is an easy target,\u201d said Randy Blazak, a sociologist who studies political violence. \u201cThey\u2019re rolling down our streets. They have dealerships in our neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nMusk critics have organized dozens of peaceful demonstrations at Tesla dealerships and factories across North America and Europe. Some Tesla owners, including a U.S. senator who feuded with Musk, have vowed to sell their vehicles.\n\nBut the attacks are keeping law enforcement busy.\n\nProsecutors in Colorado charged a woman last month in connection with attacks on Tesla dealerships, including Molotov cocktails thrown at vehicles and the words \u201cNazi cars\u201d spray-painted on a building.\n\nAnd federal agents in South Carolina last week arrested a man they say set fire to Tesla charging stations near Charleston. An agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives wrote in an affidavit that authorities found writings critical of the government and DOGE in his bedroom and wallet.\n\n\u201cThe statement made mention of sending a message based on these beliefs,\u201d the agent wrote.\n\nSome of the most prominent incidents have been reported in left-leaning cities in the Pacific Northwest, like Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, where anti-Trump and anti-Musk sentiment runs high.\n\nAn Oregon man faces charges after allegedly throwing several Molotov cocktails at a Tesla store in Salem, then returning another day and shooting out windows. In the Portland suburb of Tigard, more than a dozen bullets were fired at a Tesla showroom last week, damaging vehicles and windows, the second time in a week that the store was targeted.\n\nFour Cybertrucks were set on fire in a Tesla lot in Seattle earlier this month. On Friday, witnesses reported a man poured gasoline on an unoccupied Tesla Model S and started a fire on a Seattle street.\n\nIn Las Vegas, several Tesla vehicles were set ablaze early Tuesday outside a Tesla service center where the word \u201cresist\u201d was also painted in red across the building\u2019s front doors. Authorities said at least one person threw Molotov cocktails \u2014 crude bombs filled with gasoline or another flammable liquid \u2014 and fired several rounds from a weapon into the vehicles.\n\n\u201cWas this terrorism? Was it something else? It certainly has some of the hallmarks that we might think \u2014 the writing on the wall, potential political agenda, an act of violence,\u201d Spencer Evans, the special agent in charge of the Las Vegas FBI office, said at a news conference. \u201cNone of those factors are lost on us.\u201d\n\nTesla becomes a target for the left\n\nTesla was once the darling of the left. Helped to viability by a $465 million federal loan during the Obama administration, the company popularized electric vehicles and proved, despite their early reputation, that they didn\u2019t have to be small, stodgy, underpowered and limited in range.\n\nMore recently, though, Musk has allied himself with the right. He bought the social network Twitter, renamed it X and erased restrictions that had infuriated conservatives. He spent an estimated $250 million to boost Trump\u2019s 2024 Republican campaign, becoming by far his biggest benefactor.\n\nMusk continues to run Tesla \u2014 as well as X and the rocket manufacturer SpaceX \u2014 while also serving as Trump\u2019s adviser.\n\nTesla stock doubled in value in the weeks after Trump\u2019s election but has since shed all those gains.\n\nTrump gave a boost to the company when he turned the White House driveway into an electric-vehicle showroom. He promoted the vehicles and said he would purchase an $80,000 Model S, eschewing his fierce past criticism of electric vehicles.\n\nTesla didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Musk briefly addressed the vandalism Monday during an appearance on Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s podcast, saying \u201cat least some of it is organized and paid for\u201d by \u201cleft-wing organizations in America, funded by left-wing billionaires, essentially.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\u201d Musk wrote Tuesday on X, sharing a video of burning Teslas in Las Vegas. \u201cTesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\u201d\n\nThe progressive group Indivisible, which published a guide for supporters to organize \u201cMusk Or Us\u201d protests around the country, said in a statement that all of its guidance is publicly available and \u201cit explicitly encourages peaceful protest and condemns any acts of violence or vandalism.\u201d\n\nSome Tesla owners have resorted to cheeky bumper stickers to distance themselves from their vehicle\u2019s new stigma and perhaps deter would-be vandals. They say things like \u201cI bought this before we knew Elon was crazy\u201d or \u201cI just wanted an electric car. Sorry guys.\u201d\n\nPrices for used Cybertrucks, Tesla\u2019s most distinctive product, have dropped nearly 8% since Trump took office, according to CarGurus, which aggregates used-car vehicle listings. The market as a whole remained steady over the period.\n\nThe White House vows a crackdown\n\nThe White House has thrown its weight behind Musk, the highest-profile member of Trump\u2019s administration and a key donor to committees promoting Trump\u2019s political interests. Trump has said Tesla vandalism amounts to \u201cdomestic terror,\u201d and Trump has threatened retribution, warning that those who target the company are \u201cgoing to go through hell.\u201d\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi said she\u2019d opened an investigation \u201cto see how is this being funded, who is behind this.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to touch a Tesla, go to a dealership, do anything, you better watch out because we\u2019re coming after you,\u201d Bondi said Friday on Fox Business Network. In a statement Tuesday, she vowed to \u201ccontinue investigations that impose severe consequences,\u201d including for \u201cthose operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes.\u201d\n\nColin Clarke, a senior research fellow at the Soufan Center, said left-wing political violence tends to target property rather than people. He views the rise of neo-Nazi groups as a bigger security threat at this point.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the type of act that I would prioritize,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cNot right now compared to all the other threats that are out there.\u201d\n\nTheresa Ramsdell is the president of the Tesla Owners of Washington state, a club for Tesla enthusiasts, and she and her husband own three of them.\n\n\u201cHate on Elon and Trump all you want \u2014 that\u2019s fine and dandy, it\u2019s your choice,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t justify ruining somebody\u2019s property, vandalizing it, destroying it, setting it on fire. There\u2019s other ways to get your voice heard that\u2019s more effective.\u201d\n\nSomeone recently slapped a \u201cno Elon\u201d sticker on the tailgate of her Cybertruck, but she said she doesn\u2019t intend to stop driving her Teslas. Other club members have taken a similar view, she said.\n\n\u201cI love my car. It\u2019s the safest car,\u201d Ramsdell said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let somebody else judge me for the car I drive.\u201d\n\n___\n\nCooper reported from Phoenix.",

        "full_text": "In Hialeah, Florida, a city that\u2019s 95% Hispanic, only three residents showed up at a recent city council meeting to speak against a partnership with the federal government to enforce immigration laws.\n\nThe police departments in Hialeah, where three out of four people were born abroad, and Coral Gables, with a majority of Hispanics mostly of Cuban descent, have entered into agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement with very little visible pushback.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s doubling of immigration arrests and ramping up of deportations could have a disproportionate impact on South Florida, home to some of the nation\u2019s largest communities of Cubans, Venezuelans and other Latin Americans. But reaction here to Trump\u2019s crackdown has been far more muted than during his first term, reflecting both the rightward shift of Latino voters and a belief among some that restrictive border measures are necessary.\n\n\u201cI understand some people feel a little bit betrayed because most of us voted him in,\u201d said Frank Ayllon, a 41-year-old sales representative from Miami. \u201cI feel like a lot of these people are taking it very personal. And it\u2019s not personal. It\u2019s just that you\u2019ve got to understand that this has been an open border for many years.\u201d\n\nAyllon echoed Trump\u2019s attacks on former President Joe Biden, whose administration saw record-high illegal border crossings before falling by the end of his term. Having once been critical Trump\u2019s 2020 election lies, Ayllon now says he thought the president has had the most action-packed beginning of a term he has ever seen.\n\nA political shift begins to stick\n\nWhen Miami-Dade County ordered jail officials in 2017 to hold people suspected of being in the U.S. illegally, dozens lined up to speak against the order at a public meeting, with some shouting \u201cshame on you.\u201d Lawmakers including former Vice President Kamala Harris, then California\u2019s junior senator, joined large protests outside a local immigrant detention facility.\n\nNow in Trump\u2019s second term, the protest movement is splintered. But there\u2019s also been a broader political shift in South Florida and Latino communities.\n\nWhile Harris in the 2024 presidential election won more than half of Hispanic voters, that support was down slightly from the roughly 6 in 10 Hispanic voters that Biden won in 2020. Roughly half of Latino men voted for Harris, down from about 6 in 10 who went for Biden.\n\nIn the November election, 7 in 10 Hispanic voters in Florida said they favored reducing the number of immigrants who were allowed to seek asylum in the U.S. when they arrived at the U.S. border, according to VoteCast. That was in line with Florida voters overall.\n\nIn 2024, Trump won not just Miami-Dade County but the central Florida counties of Seminole and Osceola, where many Venezuelans have immigrated, and made inroads in heavily Puerto Rican areas of Pennsylvania. He also flipped several South Texas border counties that were Democratic bastions for decades.\n\nWhat initially catapulted Trump\u2019s popularity in South Florida was his stance on the socialist governments that many exiles and their families fled, along with his focus on boosting growth and reducing prices. But at a rally in Miami days before announcing his third White House bid in November 2022, Trump said that, contrary to the belief of some, Hispanics liked his vows to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\n\u201cWhen I talked about the border, you know who the biggest fans of that were? (they) were the Hispanics, Latinos,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey knew more about the border than anybody. They knew more about it. Everybody said, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s going to hurt himself with Hispanics.\u2019 Actually, it turned out to be the exact opposite.\u201d\n\nBarbara Canales, a 49-year-old certified nursing assistant who lives in Hialeah, said her mother brought her as a young girl from Honduras with a visa and overstayed it. It took them many years to legalize their status and to be able to bring other family members.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I totally agree that you need to take illegal immigrants out of the United States. I\u2019m sorry, but they should do it,\u201d Canales said, adding that she feels most of the migrants arriving in the past few years are different. \u201cWhen you come in with a visa is a totally different story.\u201d\n\nCanales says that while the Republican president has made immigration his signature issue, previous Democratic administrations have been just as willing to enforce immigration laws and deport people who had built their lives in the U.S. Former President Barack Obamaearned the nickname \u201cdeporter in chief\u201d from advocacy groups who opposed his use of enforcement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the reality that if you\u2019re here breaking the rules, you have to suffer the consequences,\u201d Canales said.\n\nMiami\u2019s Cuban exiles are split\n\nMiami is particularly well-known for its community of Cuban exiles who originally fled the government of communist leader Fidel Castro. About two-thirds of Cuban voters in Florida supported Trump in 2024, according to VoteCast, while about one-third supported Harris.\n\nCubans have long prided themselves of arriving here legally through several refugee and family-based programs and have been able to get green cards easier than people from other countries, thanks to a Cold War-era law.\n\nAfter Obama in 2017 ended the \u201cwet foot, dry foot\u201d policy that considered any Cuban who set foot on dry land to be automatically a legal arrival, Cubans leaving for the U.S. have found more obstacles.\n\nIt did not stop many from coming.\n\nBetween 2021 and 2022, the U.S. government recorded the largest flight of Cuban exiles since the Mariel boatlift in 1980, when nearly 125,000 Cubans came to the U.S. over a six-month period.\n\n\u201cWe are all in favor of legal immigration. My parents are products of legal immigration, like many of your parents, if not you directly,\u201d said Hialeah Mayor Esteban Bovo, a strong Trump ally, during the recent city council meeting about an ICE partnership.\n\nTrump picked up support from new Cuban immigrants such as Luis Boulart, 85, who arrived in 2015, got his citizenship in 2022 and cast his first presidential vote for Trump in 2024. Boulart recently said he trusted the president and believed the Republican party could better handle immigration, the economy, immigration and foreign policy.\n\n\u201cI think the challenges ahead are huge. But he is capable of solving all the problems,\u201d Boulart said.\n\nBut those policy changes have meant more recent arrivals have a tougher path to legal status than preceding generations did.\n\nJulian Padron, a 79-year-old who said he was jailed in Cuba, arrived decades ago when President Jimmy Carter negotiated with Castro the release of hundreds of political prisoners to the United States. He said he feels strongly against Trump and considers his actions anti-democratic.\n\nHe frequents Domino Park, located on Calle Ocho in Miami\u2019s iconic Little Havana, where a lot of the players sitting at four-person tables on a recent day were supportive of Trump. Padron said he typically keeps his thoughts to himself unless he is asked for his opinion. A park employee first told an reporter that political questions were not allowed at this park to avoid arguments. But when asked which directive forbade that, the employee said he would find out and then allowed the interviews to continue.\n\n\u201cThey are going to be detaining people,\u201d Padron said, looking around the park. \u201cDo they not know that people are still fleeing communism?\u201d",

        "full_text": "President Donald Trump is granting a one-month exemption on his stiff new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers, as worries persist that the newly launched trade war could crush domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe pause comes after Trump spoke with leaders of the \u201cbig 3\u201d automakers, Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, on Wednesday, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.\n\nAsked if 30 days was enough for the auto sector to prepare for the new taxes, Leavitt said Trump was blunt with the automakers seeking an exemption: \u201cHe told them that they should get on it, start investing, start moving, shift production here to the United States of America where they will pay no tariff.\u201d\n\nTrump had long promised to impose tariffs, but his opening weeks in the White House involved aggressive threats and surprise suspensions, leaving allies unclear at what the U.S. president is actually trying to achieve.\n\nBased off various Trump administration statements, the tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China imposed on Tuesday are about stopping illegal immigration, blocking fentanyl smuggling, closing the trade gap, balancing the federal budget and other nations showing more respect for Trump.\n\nAll of that has left Canada, a long-standing ally, determined to stand up against Trump with their own retaliatory tariffs, rejecting a White House overture to possibly reduce some of tariffs imposed on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to back down,\u201d Ontario Premier Doug Ford said after speaking with the Canadian prime minister. \u201cWe will not budge. Zero tariffs and that is it\u201d\n\nFord told The that the auto sector in the United States and Canada would last approximately 10 days before they start shutting down the assembly lines because of the tariffs.\n\n\u201cPeople are going to lose their jobs,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter the White House announced the one month reprieve, shares of big U.S., Asian and European automakers jumped as much as 6%.\n\nBut pausing the 25% taxes on autos and auto parts traded through the North American trade pact USMCA would only delay a broader reckoning to take place on April 2, when Trump is set to impose broad \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs to match the taxes and subsidies that other countries charge on imports.\n\nThe U.S. automaker Ford said in a statement: \u201cWe will continue to have a healthy and candid dialogue with the Administration to help achieve a bright future for our industry and U.S. manufacturing.\u201d\n\nGM in a statement thanked Trump \u201cfor his approach, which enables American automakers like GM to compete and invest domestically.\u201d\n\nStellantis also thanked Trump for the one-month exemption, saying it \u201cstrongly\u201d supported \u201chis determination to enable the American automotive sector to thrive.\u201d\n\nOther industries are also likely to seek exemptions from the import taxes.\n\n\u201cA number of industries have reached out to us to ask us for exemptions to the tariffs,\u201d Vice President JD Vance said Wednesday.\n\nThe White House repeatedly insisted that it would not grant exemptions and the sudden turnaround reflects the economic and political problems being created by Trump\u2019s day-old tariffs. While the Republican president sees them as enriching the United States, his plans to tax imports have alienated allies and caused anxiety about slower economic growth and accelerating inflation.\n\nThe U.S. president engaged in a phone call on Wednesday with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, as U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had suggested that the administration was looking to meet Canada and Mexico \u201cin the middle.\u201d\n\nBut Trudeau refused to lift Canada\u2019s retaliatory tariffs so long as Trump continues with his new taxes on imports from Canada, a senior government official told The . The official confirmed the stance on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.\n\n\u201cBoth countries will continue to be in contact today,\u201d Trudeau\u2019s office said.\n\nThe prospect of a trade war appears to be an ongoing feature of the Trump administration. In addition to his upcoming reciprocal tariffs that could strike the European Union, India, Brazil, South Korea, Canada and Mexico, Trump wants to tax imports of computer chips, pharmaceutical drugs and autos. He also closed exemptions on his 2018 steel and aluminum tariffs and is investigating tariffs on copper as well.\n\nTariffs are taxes paid by importers in the countries receiving the goods, so the cost could largely be passed along to U.S. consumers and businesses in the form of higher prices. In his Tuesday night speech to a joint session of Congress, Trump tried to minimize the financial pain as a \u201c little disturbance.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt may be a little bit of an adjustment period,\u201d he said after claiming that farmers would benefit from reciprocal tariffs on countries that have tariffs on U.S. exports. \u201cYou have to bear with me again and this will be even better.\u201d\n\nTrump has predicted that tariffs will lead to greater investment inside the U.S., creating factory jobs and boosting growth in the long term.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump put 25% taxes on imports from Mexico and Canada, taxing Canadian energy products such as oil and electricity at a lower 10% rate. The president also doubled the 10% tariff he placed on China to 20%.\n\nThe administration has claimed that the tariffs are about stopping the smuggling of drugs such as fentanyl, with aides asserting that this is about a \u201cdrug war\u201d rather than a \u201ctrade war.\u201d U.S. customs agents seized just 43 pounds (19.5 kilograms) of fentanyl at the northern border the last fiscal year.\n\nTrudeau said on Tuesday that his country would plaster tariffs on over $100 billion (U.S. dollars) of American goods over the course of 21 days, stressing that the United States had abandoned a long-standing friendship.\n\n\u201cToday, the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same time, they are talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying, murderous dictator. Make that make sense,\u201d Trudeau said on Tuesday.\n\nMexico indicated it would announce its own countermeasures on Sunday.\n\nBeijing responded with tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of U.S. farm exports. It also expanded the number of U.S. companies subject to export controls and other restrictions by about two dozen.\n\n\u201cIf war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we\u2019re ready to fight till the end,\u201d China\u2019s embassy to the United States posted on X on Tuesday night.\n\nIn response to China, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told Channel\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends\u201d that the United States is \u201cprepared\u201d for war against the world\u2019s second largest economy.\n\n\u201cThose who long for peace must prepare for war,\u201d Hegseth said Wednesday morning. \u201cIf we want to deter war with the Chinese or others, we have to be strong.\u201d\n\nLeavitt is one of three administration officials who face a lawsuit from The on First- and Fifth-amendment grounds. The says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.\n\n___\n\n writer Alexa St. John in Detroit contributed reporting.

        "full_text": "George Foreman became the heavyweight champion of the world in his 20s, only to lose his belt to Muhammad Ali in perhaps the most memorable fight in boxing history.\n\nA full 20 years later in 1994, the 45-year-old Foreman became the oldest man to win the heavyweight championship, throwing one perfect combination to steal Michael Moorer\u2019s title in an epic upset.\n\nFew fighters ever had more big moments than Big George Foreman \u2014 and even after he finally left the ring, he was only getting started.\n\nThe fearsome heavyweight, who lost the \u201cRumble in the Jungle\u201d to Ali before his inspiring second act as a surprising champion and a successful businessman, died Friday night. Foreman was 76.\n\nForeman\u2019s family announced his death on social media, not saying how or where he died.\n\n\u201cA devout preacher, a devoted husband, a loving father and a proud grand- and great-grandfather, he lived a life marked by unwavering faith, humility and purpose,\u201d his family wrote. \u201cA humanitarian, an Olympian and two-time heavyweight champion of the world, he was deeply respected. A force for good, a man of discipline, conviction, and a protector of his legacy, fighting tirelessly to preserve his good name\u2014 for his family.\u201d\n\nA native Texan, Foreman began his boxing career as an Olympic gold medalist who inspired fear and awe as he climbed to the peak of the heavyweight division by stopping Joe Frazier in 1973. His formidable aura evaporated only a year later when Ali pulled off one of the most audacious victories in boxing history in Zaire, baiting and taunting Foreman into losing his belt.\n\nForeman left the sport a few years later, but returned after a 10-year absence and a self-described religious awakening.\n\nThe middle-aged fighter then pulled off one of the most spectacular knockouts in boxing history, flooring Moorer \u2014 19 years his junior \u2014 with a surgical right hand and claiming Moorer\u2019s two heavyweight belts. Foreman\u2019s 20 years is easily the longest gap between heavyweight title reigns.\n\n\u201cHis contribution to boxing and beyond will never be forgotten,\u201d former heavyweight champion of the world, Mike Tyson, said on X, formerly Twitter, as he expressed his condolences.\n\nForeman\u2019s transformation into an inspirational figure was complete, and he fought only four more times \u2014 finishing 76-5 with 68 knockouts \u2014 before moving onto his next career as a genial businessman, pitchman and occasional actor.\n\nOutside the ring, he was best known as the face of the George Foreman Grill, which launched in the same year as his victory over Moorer. The simple cooking machine sold more than 100 million units and made him much wealthier than his sport ever did.\n\n\u201cGeorge was a great friend to not only myself, but to my entire family,\u201d Top Rank president Bob Arum said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost a family member and are absolutely devastated.\u201d\n\nIn the first chapter of his boxing career, Foreman was nothing like the smiling grandfather who hawked his grills on television to great success.\n\nForeman dabbled in petty crime while growing up in Houston\u2019s Fifth Ward, but changed his life through boxing. He made the U.S. Olympic team in 1968 and won gold in Mexico City as a teenager, stopping a 29-year-old opponent in a star-making performance.\n\nForeman rose to the pinnacle of the pro game over the next five years, but was also perceived as an aloof, unfriendly athlete, both through his demeanor and through the skewed racial lenses of the time.\n\nJim Lampley, the veteran boxing broadcaster who worked alongside Foreman for many years at HBO, told The on Friday night that Foreman\u2019s initial demeanor was an attempt by his camp to emulate Sonny Liston, the glowering heavyweight champ of the 1960s.\n\n\u201cAt some point somewhere along the way, he realized that wasn\u2019t him,\u201d Lampley said.\n\nForeman stopped Frazier in an upset in Jamaica in January 1973 to win the belt, with his knockout inspiring Howard Cosell\u2019s iconic call: \u201cDown goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!\u201d\n\nForeman defended his belt against Ken Norton before accepting the fight with Ali in the now-immortal bout staged in Africa by promoter Don King. Ali put on a tactical masterclass against Foreman, showing off the \u201crope-a-dope\u201d strategy that frustrated and infuriated the champion. Foreman was eventually knocked down for the first time in his career, and the fight was stopped in the eighth round.\n\nForeman told the in 2014 that he took the fight almost out of charity to Ali, who he suspected to be broke.\n\n\u201cI said I was going to go out there and kill him, and people said, \u2018Please, don\u2019t say you\u2019re going to kill Muhammad,\u2019\u201d Foreman said. \u201cSo I said, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll just beat him down to the ground.\u2019 That\u2019s how easy I thought the fight would be.\u201d\n\nExhausted and disillusioned, Foreman stopped fighting in 1977 and largely spent the next decade preaching and working with kids in Houston after his religious awakening. He returned to boxing in 1987 in his late 30s with a plan to defy time through frequent ring appearances, and he racked up a lengthy series of victories before losing to Evander Holyfield in a surprisingly competitive title fight in 1991.\n\nThree years later, Foreman got in the ring with Moorer in Las Vegas, more for his celebrity than for his perceived ability to beat Moorer. The champion appeared to win the first nine rounds rather comfortably, with Foreman unable to land his slower punches. But Foreman came alive in the 10th, hurting Moorer before slipping in the short right hand that sent Moorer to the canvas in earth-shaking fashion.\n\nLampley, who was calling the fight, named his upcoming autobiography \u2014 which includes a prologue about Foreman \u2014 after his famous call of that moment: \u201cIt Happened!\u201d\n\nForeman quit the ring for good in 1997, although he occasionally discussed a comeback. He settled into a life as a boxing analyst for HBO and as a pitchman for the grills that grew his fame and fortune. Much of the world soon knew Foreman as both a lovable friend and a ferocious fighter.\n\n\u201cHe started performing as this pitchman, this product pitchman with the big, ever-present giant grin on his face,\u201d Lampley recalled. \u201cWhen I was working with him, people would say, \u2018George is a big clown.\u2019 And I would say, \u2018Well, you can call him a clown, but he\u2019s actually a genius. He may be the greatest genius I\u2019ve ever met.\u2019 And people would say, \u2018Well, genius, what do you mean?\u2019 I\u2019d say, \u2018Well, check the bank account. If that isn\u2019t proof enough, I don\u2019t know what is.\u2019 So, he was a genius. He was a human genius.\u201d\n\nForeman briefly starred in a sitcom called \u201cGeorge\u201d in the 1990s, and he even appeared on the reality singing competition \u201cThe Masked Singer\u201d in 2022. A biographical movie based on his life was released in 2023.\n\nForeman had 12 children, including five sons who are all famously named George Edward Foreman.\n\n\u201cLegendary boxing champion, life-changing preacher, husband, father, grand- and great-grandfather and the best friend you could have,\u201d WBC President Mauricio Sulaiman wrote on social media. \u201cHis memory is now eternal, may Big George rest in peace.\u201d\n\n___\n\n Sports Writer Brian Mahoney contributed to this report.\n\n___",

        "full_text": "ANGOLA, La. \u2014 Louisiana used nitrogen gas to put a man to death Tuesday evening for a killing decades ago, marking the first time the state has used the method as it resumed executions after a 15-year hiatus.\n\nJessie Hoffman Jr., 46, was pronounced dead at 6:50 p.m. at the Louisiana State Penitentiary, authorities said, adding the nitrogen gas had flowed for 19 minutes during what one official characterized as a \u201cflawless\u201d execution.\n\nWitnesses to the execution said Hoffman appeared to involuntarily shake or had \u201csome convulsive activity.\u201d But the three witnesses who spoke \u2014 including two members of the media \u2014 agreed that, based on the protocol and what they learned about the execution method, nothing seemed out of the ordinary.\n\nWitness Gina Swanson, a reporter with WDSU, described the execution from her viewpoint as \u201cclinical\u201d and \u201cprocedural.\u201d She said there was nothing that occurred during the process that made her think, \u201cWas that right? Was that how it was supposed to go?\u201d\n\nHoffman declined to make a final statement in the execution chamber. He also declined a final meal.\n\nIt was the fifth time nitrogen gas was used in the U.S. after four executions by the same method \u2014 all in Alabama. Three other executions, by lethal injection, are scheduled this week \u2014 in Arizona on Wednesday and in Florida and Oklahoma on Thursday.\n\nHoffman convicted of New Orleans murder\n\nHoffman was convicted of the murder of Mary \u201cMolly\u201d Elliott, a 28-year-old advertising executive who was killed in New Orleans. At the time of the crime, Hoffman was 18 and has since spent much of his adult life at the penitentiary in rural southeast Louisiana, where he was executed Tuesday evening.\n\nAfter court battles earlier this month, attorneys for Hoffman had turned to the Supreme Court in last-ditch hopes of halting the execution. Last year, the court declined to intervene in the nation\u2019s first nitrogen hypoxia execution, in Alabama.\n\nHoffman\u2019s lawyers had unsuccessfully argued that the nitrogen gas procedure \u2014 which deprives a person of oxygen \u2014 violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. The man\u2019s lawyers, in a last-ditch appeal, also argued the method would infringe on Hoffman\u2019s freedom to practice religion, specifically his Buddhist breathing and meditation in the moments leading up to death.\n\nLouisiana officials maintained the method is painless. They also said it was past time for the state to deliver justice as promised to victims\u2019 families after a decade and a half hiatus \u2014 one brought on partly by an inability to secure lethal injection drugs.\n\nThe Supreme Court voted 5-4 in declining to step in.\n\nHours earlier at a hearing Tuesday, a 19th Judicial District Court Judge Richard \u201cChip\u201d Moore also declined to stop the execution. He agreed with the state\u2019s lawyers who had argued the man\u2019s religion-based arguments fell under the jurisdiction of a federal judge who had already ruled on them, according to local news outlets.\n\nExecution method deprives body of oxygen\n\nUnder the Louisiana protocol, which is nearly identical to Alabama\u2019s, officials had earlier said Hoffman would be strapped to a gurney before a full-face respirator mask fitted tightly on him. Pure nitrogen gas was then pumped into the mask, forcing him to breathe it in and depriving him of the oxygen needed to maintain bodily functions.\n\nThe protocol called for the gas to be administered for at least 15 minutes or five minutes after the inmate\u2019s heart rate reaches a flatline indication on the EKG, whichever is longer.\n\nTwo media witnesses to Tuesday\u2019s execution said Hoffman was covered with a gray plush blanket from the neck down. In the chamber with Hoffman was his spiritual adviser. Ahead of the execution and after the curtains closed to the viewing room, witnesses said they could hear Buddhist chanting.\n\nThe gas began to flow at 6:21 p.m. and Hoffman started twitching, media witnesses said. His hands clenched and he had a \u201cslight head movement.\u201d Swanson said she closely watched the blanket over Hoffman\u2019s chest area and could see it rise and fall, indicating that he was breathing. She said his last visible breath appeared to be at 6:37 p.m. Shortly after, the curtains between the chamber and witness viewing room closed. When they reopened, Hoffman was pronounced dead.\n\nSeth Smith, chief of operations at the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections, witnessed the execution and also acknowledged Hoffman\u2019s movements. Smith, who has a medical background, said he perceived the convulsions to be an \u201cinvoluntary response to dying\u201d and that Hoffman appeared to be unconscious at the time.\n\nNitrogen gas was first used in Alabama\n\nEach inmate put to death using nitrogen in Alabama had appeared to shake and gasp to varying degrees during their executions, according to media witnesses, including an reporter. Alabama state officials said the reactions were involuntary movements associated with oxygen deprivation.\n\nAlabama first used nitrogen gas to put Kenneth Eugene Smith to death last year, marking the first time a new method had been used in the U.S. since lethal injection was introduced in 1982.\n\nAlabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma specifically authorize execution by nitrogen hypoxia, according to records compiled by the Death Penalty Information Center. Arkansas was added to the list on Tuesday.\n\nSeeking to resume executions, Louisiana\u2019s GOP-dominated Legislature expanded the state\u2019s approved death penalty methods last year to include nitrogen hypoxia and electrocution. Lethal injection was already in place.\n\nOn Tuesday, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed legislation allowing executions using nitrogen gas, making hers the fifth state to adopt the method. Arkansas currently has 25 people on death row.\n\nOver recent decades, the number of executions nationally has declined sharply amid legal battles, a shortage of lethal injection drugs and waning public support for capital punishment. That has led a majority of states to either abolish or pause carrying out the death penalty.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, a small group of execution opponents held a vigil outside the rural southeast Louisiana prison at Angola, where the state\u2019s executions are carried out. Some passed out prayer cards with photos of a smiling Hoffman and planned a Buddhist reading and \u201cMeditation for Peace.\u201d\n\nLouisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said she expects at least four people to be executed this year in the state. Following Hoffman\u2019s execution, she said justice had been delayed for far too long and now Hoffman \u201dfaces the ultimate judgment, the judgment before God.\u201d",

The judge also blocked Citibank, which holds the money on behalf of EPA, from transferring it to the government or anyone else.\n\nEPA Administrator Lee Zeldin claimed the grant recipients engaged in mismanagement, fraud and self-dealing in announcing that he froze and moved to terminate the grants, but the judge said Zeldin's allegations were inadequate.\n\n\"At this juncture, EPA Defendants have not sufficiently explained why unilaterally terminating Plaintiffs\u2019 grant awards was a rational precursor to reviewing\" the green bank program, Chutkan wrote.\n\nEPA TERMINATES BIDEN ADMIN'S GREEN GRANTS WORTH $20B, ZELDIN SAYS\n\nThe grant recipients sued the EPA, Zeldin and Citibank, arguing that they had illegally denied the groups access to $14 billion awarded last year through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, commonly referred to as a \"green bank.\" The program, which consisted of two initiatives worth $14 billion and $6 billion, respectively, was approved by Congress under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act to support clean energy and climate-friendly projects.\n\nThree groups \u2014 Climate United, the Coalition for Green Capital and Power Forward Communities \u2014 said the frozen grants prevented them from funding new projects and might force them to lay off staff.

He also claimed taking part in a deadly attack on a concert hall in Moscow, and a blast targeting Canadian embassy security guards in Kabul.\n\nMohammad Sharifullah's capture in a joint raid between Pakistani intelligence and the Central Intelligence Agency was announced by President Donald Trump at a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night, revealing that the U.S. had captured Sharifullah, also known as \u201cJafar.\u201d Trump also told the nation that Sharifullah is believed to be one of the ISIS-K terrorists responsible for the August 2021 Abbey Gate terrorist attack that killed 13 American troops during the bungled withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nJafar landed in U.S. custody at Washington Dulles International Airport and has an initial court appearance Wednesday in Alexandria, Virginia. New FBI court documents shed further light on the slew of attacks in which Sharifullah has claimed a role.\n\nSharifullah was read his \"Miranda rights\" by the FBI and he proceeded to tell them he was recruited into ISIS-K around 2016. The FBI said the terrorist was imprisoned in Afghanistan from approximately 2019 until two weeks before the Kabul airport attack. An ISIS-K suicide bomber named Abdul Rahman al-Logari \u2014 who had been freed by the Taliban from a prison at Bagram Air Base in mid-August 2021, mere weeks after the U.S. abandoned the base \u2014 has been identified as having carried out the suicide attack at Abbey Gate. The FBI said Sharifullah recognized Logari as an ISIS-K operative he had known while in prison.\n\nLead-up to the Kabul airport attack\n\nThe FBI said Sharifullah was contacted by another ISIS-K member upon being freed from prison in mid-August 2021 who linked Sharifullah up with the ISIS-K plot to attack U.S. forces at Hamid Karzai International Airport. The bureau said ISIS-K members provided Sharifullah with a motorcycle, funds for a cell phone, and instructions on using social media to communicate with them in the lead-up to the attack.\n\nSharifullah said he \u201cwas tasked with scouting a route near HKIA for an attacker,\u201d the FBI said, and Sharifullah \u201cconducted surveillance on a route, specifically checking for law enforcement and American or Taliban checkpoints.\u201d The terrorist told his ISIS-K associates that the route seemed clear and that he didn\u2019t believe Logari would be detected when approaching HKIA.\n\nThe Abbey Gate attack killed eleven Marines, one Army soldier, one Navy corpsman, and an estimated 170 Afghan civilians, while wounding dozens of other U.S. troops and scores of Afghans in the crowd, on August 26, 2021.\n\nPatel: \"The FBI will never forget\"\n\nGold Star family members of the fallen U.S. soldiers pleaded with the Biden administration for more answers about the attack, reported, including during a roundtable before the House Foreign Affairs Committee in 2023, where the Biden White House sought to place the blame for the debacle on the first Trump Administration.\n\nEarlier this year, the family members condemned the Biden administration for doing \"nothing but attempt to take victory laps and thumb their noses at the sacrifice our children made on that fateful day,\" and the families called upon the Trump administration to pursue answers. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said last week that \"we\u2019re taking a very different view obviously than the previous [Biden] administration \u2014 and there will be full accountability.\"\n\nSharifullah has been charged with providing material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization resulting in death, and he faces a potential life sentence. FBI Director Kash Patel vowed that \u201cthe FBI will never forget the loss of these American heroes, we will continue to hunt down those who viciously murdered our warriors, we will find all responsible and bring them to justice.\u201d Attorney General Pam Bondi said that \u201cunder President Trump\u2019s strong leadership on the world stage, this Department of Justice will ensure that terrorists like Mohammad Sharifullah have no safe haven.\u201d\n\nAnd CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Wednesday that \u201cmy second day on the job, I spoke with the head of Pakistani intelligence. I shared with him intelligence we had indicating that Jafar was located in the Afghan-Pakistan border region.\u201d\n\nThen-President Joe Biden announced the unconditional withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in an April 2021 speech, setting the withdrawal deadline for the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attack. The Taliban conducted a rapid takeover of the country in the ensuing months and swept into the Afghan capital of Kabul on August 15, 2021. The chaotic and deadly non-combatant evacuation operation by the U.S. was conducted while the U.S. military relied upon a hostile Taliban to provide security outside the airport.\n\nTrump said Tuesday that \"we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity, and he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice.\"\n\nThe \"fake mastermind\"\n\nSarah Adams, a writer and an alum of the CIA who has investigated the Abbey Gate attack, argued on X that Trump was being misled and that Sharifullah was a \u201cfake mastermind.\u201d She contended that the Abbey Gate attack instead \u201chad two joint Masterminds\u201d neither of which were Sharifullah. She said that Sirajuddin Haqqani, the current Taliban interior minister and the leader of the terrorist Haqqani Network, and Sanaullah Ghafari, believed to be a former mid-level Haqqani commander and the current leader of ISIS-K were the \"real\" masterminds.\n\nMastermind or not, the FBI said Sharifullah further confessed to playing a role in the March 2024 attack by ISIS-K against the Crocus City Hall near Moscow, Russia, which killed approximately 130 people. The Biden State Department said it had collected intelligence indicating that ISIS-K was planning an attack in Moscow and contended that it had warned the Kremlin about it.\n\nSharifullah said he received an order from an ISIS-K senior leader to teach would-be attackers in Moscow on how to use AK-style rifles. He added that he later recognized two of perpetrators as men to whom he had provided the online firearms training.\n\nDeath at the Canadian embassy\n\nThe FBI said Sharifullah also confessed to a role in facilitating a June 2016 suicide bombing attack which intended to target U.S. Embassy personnel in Kabul but which actually killed more than ten guards tasked with protecting the Canadian embassy. Sharifullah said he conducted surveillance ahead of that attack and transported the bomber, who he said was named \"Irfan,\" to the site of the attack.\n\nAt the time, that suicide bomber was widely reported to have been part of the Taliban, and the Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid had even touted the deadly bombing on then-Twitter, saying it was carried out \u201cagainst the forces of aggression\u201d in Afghanistan.\n\nThe UN sanctions monitoring team said in a May 2020 report published by Security Council Report that some of the attacks claimed by ISIS-K may have arisen via \u201ctactical accommodation\u201d with the Haqqani Network. The UN team also said that some countries noted that most ISIS-K attacks include \u201cinvolvement, facilitation, or the provision of technical assistance\u201d by the Haqqani Network. The UN team also said it had \u201cviewed communication intercepts in the wake of attacks that were claimed by ISIS-K that were traceable to known members of the Haqqani Network.\u201d\n\nOne UN member state said in June 2021 that Ghafari\u2019s ongoing relationship with the Haqqanis provided ISIS-K with \u201ckey expertise and access to [attack] networks.\u201d The UN team said that some attacks by ISIS-K may have been \u201cjoint ventures\u201d with the Haqqanis.\n\nNeither the FBI nor any of the involved governmental agencies have been able to fully answer the many unanswered questions raised by lawmakers about the attacks and withdrawal, but Sharifullah may very well provide answers \u2014 if they can be relied upon \u2014 as his case moves through the judicial system.",

        "full_text": "The FBI has handed over to Congress key documents related to Biden-era \u201cweaponization\u201d scandals at the Justice Department following a subpoena from House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan.\n\nFBI Assistant Director Marshall Yates sent a letter to Jordan on Friday vowing that \u201cunder Director Kash Patel's leadership, the FBI is dedicated to working with Congress towards transparency,\u201d according to a copy of the letter obtained by , with the FBI official providing the House with internal bureau records tied to former Attorney General Merrick Garland\u2019s divisive school board memorandum aimed at protesting parents.\n\nThe records also include the Richmond, Va., FBI field office\u2019s since-retracted memo targeting Catholics, and the bureau\u2019s controversial investigations enforcing the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act.\n\nJordan, who has long sought answers on \u201cthe weaponization of federal law enforcement against the American people\u201d under former President Joe Biden, filed a subpoena with Patel\u2019s FBI in late February, arguing that the bureau \u201crefused any real transparency or accountability for its actions\u201d during former Director Christopher Wray\u2019s tenure and arguing that Wray had ignored several subpoenas Jordan had issued.\n\nThe Ohio Republican argued to Patel last month that \u201cit is important that you succeed in restoring public confidence and creating much-needed transparency.\u201d The new documents the FBI handed over may be a step in that direction.\n\n\"We are thankful for Director Patel's work, and we will have more updates soon,\" Jordan's spokesman Russell Dye told .\n\nThe FBI said in its new letter that, in response to Jordan\u2019s subpoena related to Garland's school board memorandum, \u201cadditional documents\u201d from the bureau were being handed over, including \u201cthe FBI summaries of the outstanding \u2018EDUOFFICIALS\u2019-tagged Guardians not previously provided to Congress due to their then-ongoing investigative status or classification.\u201d\n\nThe FBI said that \u201cone of these additional, now closed Guardians is classified and we will arrange delivery of this information with Committee staff at their convenience\u201d but that \u201cwe have confirmed that there were no additional Guardians that have received the \u2018EDUOFFICIALS\u2019 threat tag since the FBI's prior productions to the Committee in August 2022.\u201d\n\nJordan\u2019s late February letter to Patel said that he \u201cstill has unanswered questions about how the FBI quickly operationalized\u201d Garland\u2019s October 2021 memo which had directed the Biden-era Justice Department and FBI to investigate alleged threats posed by outspoken parents.\n\nJordan also had remaining concerns about \u201cwhether the FBI objected to the civil liberties infringements inherent in the Attorney General\u2019s memorandum.\u201d\n\nJordan revealed whistleblower evidence in November 2021 which indicated that FBI counterterrorism assets were involved in the investigation of parents protesting school policies. He released an unclassified internal FBI email at the time showing that the bureau's counterterrorism chief sent instructions to FBI officials to use a \"threat tag\" to track any complaints involving parents and school officials.\n\nIn January, Attorney General Pam Bondi used a little-noticed footnote to rescind Garland\u2019s memo.\n\nIn last Friday\u2019s letter, the FBI said that it had also handed over a \u201cfurther response to the subpoena regarding the Richmond Field Office's Domain Perspective.\u201d\n\nJordan\u2019s letter to the FBI in late February that the bureau had refused for two years to provide adequate answers on the FBI\u2019s Richmond Field Office\u2019s January 2023 memo, which linked \u201cracially or ethnically motivated violent extremists\u201d (RMVEs) with a \u201cradical-traditionalist Catholic\u201d (RTC) ideology.\n\nThe Republican chairman argued that \u201cthe Richmond memorandum resulted in federal law enforcement agents being inserted into places of worship.\u201d Jordan said that the FBI under Wray \u201cfailed to produce information regarding open-sources, FBI case files, and liaison and local law enforcement reporting used to create the Richmond memorandum \u2013 all of which were responsive to the Committee\u2019s subpoena.\u201d\n\nThe FBI intelligence product released in January 2023 by the bureau\u2019s field office in Richmond contended that links between RMVEs and RTCs \u201calmost certainly presents opportunities for threat mitigation through the exploration of new avenues for tripwires and source development.\u201d\n\nBut the FBI\u2019s national press office admitted in February 2023 that \u201cthis particular field office product\u2026does not meet the exacting standards of the FBI\u201d and claimed that \u201cupon learning of the document, FBI Headquarters quickly began taking action to remove the document from FBI systems and conduct a review of the basis for the document.\u201d\n\nThe field office\u2019s intelligence product repeatedly cited the left-wing Southern Poverty Law Center, including an article on \u201cRadical Traditional Catholicism.\u201d\n\nThe Richmond field office also pointed to an Atlantic article on \u201cHow Extremist Gun Culture is Trying to Co-Opt the Rosary.\u201d And the local field office had also cited articles by Salon, including \u201cTraditional Catholics and White Nationalist \u2018Groypers\u2019 Forge a New Far-Right Youth Movement\u201d and \u201cWhite Nationalists Get Religion.\u201d\n\nDOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz wrote in 2024 that the FBI\u2019s Inspection Division concluded that \u201cthere was no evidence of malicious intent or improper purpose\u201d behind the local field office memo, but did note significant problems with it, including that it \"failed to adhere to analytic tradecraft standards and evinced errors in professional judgment, including that it lacked sufficient evidence or articulable support for a relationship between RMVEs and so-called RTC ideology; incorrectly conflated the subjects\u2019 religious views with their RMVE activities, creating the appearance that the FBI had inappropriately considered religious beliefs and affiliation as a basis for conducting investigative activity; and reflected a lack of training and awareness concerning proper domestic terrorism terminology.\u201d\n\nThe FBI also told Jordan on Friday that it was handing over \u201cinformation regarding investigations related to the FACE Act.\u201d\n\nThe bureau said that, since May 2022, \u201cthe FBI's counterterrorism and criminal divisions have investigated 55 acts that led to FACE Act-predicated investigations.\u201d The bureau said that one investigation \u201cinvolved a facility that provides abortion services, 31 involved a facility that provides pregnancy resources, and 23 involved a facility that provides both abortion services and pregnancy resources.\u201d\n\nJordan\u2019s late February letter had alleged that, under the Biden administration, \u201cthe FBI and the Justice Department implemented a double standard in enforcing the FACE Act in a way that protected anti-life activists and facilities while effectively ignoring attacks on pro-life advocates and facilities.\u201d\n\nHe also said Wray\u2019s FBI \u201cutilized aggressive law enforcement tactics to go after pro-life advocates that bordered on thuggish\u201d as he demanded more information from the bureau.\n\nThen-FBI Director Wray testified in August 2022 that the bureau had launched \u201cdomestic violent extremism investigations\u201d into pro-abortion rights threats and attacks that increasingly targeted anti-abortion groups in the wake of the May 2022 leak of a draft of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nPresident Donald Trump in January pardoned 23 pro-life activists who were convicted under the FACE Act.\n\nPatel and the FBI handed over an initial tranche of documents in response to Jordan\u2019s subpoena earlier in March, as first reported by , with those records reportedly relating to Garland\u2019s school board memo, the failed investigation into pipe bombs planted in the nation\u2019s capital the day before the January 6th riot, the bureau's interactions with social media companies, and the now-defunct Foreign Influence Task Force.\n\n\u201cKash Patel\u2019s FBI was given a mandate to open up the books and engage in transparency efforts at levels never before seen \u2013 and our Congressional Affairs team is stepping up to the plate,\u201d FBI spokesman Ben Williamson told . \u201cWe will continue to work diligently with Chairman Jordan and Chairman Grassley to ensure the American people get the information they deserve.\u201d",

        "full_text": "President Donald Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and bilateral negotiations with Russia have spurred European leaders to offer promises to take charge of their own security and step up their defense commitments as they seek to keep the new administration engaged on the continent.\n\nLast week, President Trump shocked many European leaders when he appeared to blame Ukraine for provoking the war with Russia and labeled President Zelensky a \u201cdictator\u201d amid tense negotiations over a proposed mineral deal the administration views as a way for Ukraine to pay the United States back for its assistance.\n\nOne of President Trump\u2019s chief negotiators, U.S. Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, echoed these sentiments later, telling \u2019s Jake Tapper last weekend that the war was provoked, \u201cand that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it was provoked by the Russians\u201d and suggested that talks with Ukraine to one day join the NATO alliance may have been responsible.\n\n\u201cThat didn\u2019t need to happen, it basically became a threat to the Russians,\u201d Witkoff.\n\nA larger role\n\nMany European leaders reacted negatively to the Trump administration\u2019s decision to meet with Russian negotiators last week in Saudi Arabia, warning that no lasting peace could be achieved by cutting the Europeans and Ukraine out of negotiations.\n\nOthers however tacked a different course. French President Emmanuel Macron, who traveled Washington, D.C. on Monday in an attempt to bridge the gap, is leading a European effort promising to take on a larger security role on the continent to convince the Americans to stay engaged in finding a lasting peace for the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nMacron visited the American capital on the heels of his own \u201cemergency\u201d European summit on how to end the three-year war in Ukraine. The meeting ended with no firm plans, but it helped forge a common message from European leaders. Macron brought assurances from the United States\u2019 European allies that they are willing to do more to answer President Trump\u2019s concerns, specifically about their own contribution to the continent\u2019s defense.\n\nMacron reassured President Trump that Europe, and specifically France, shares the ultimate goal of peace in the Russia-Ukraine war. He also reiterated his warning that security guarantees for Ukraine are necessary for a \u201csolid\u201d peace, one that would stop conflict from erupting again after any brief pause in fighting.\n\n\u201cI think our common objective\u2026is to build peace and a solid and longstanding peace, and this is what we will discuss, obviously, because I have great respect for bravery and the resistance of Ukrainian people, and we do share the objective of peace, because we are very aware of the necessity to to have guarantees and solid peace in order to stabilize the situation,\u201d Macron said after his meeting with Trump.\n\nMacron also said, on behalf of the European leaders, that Europe is willing to \u201cstep up to be a stronger partner, to do more in defense and security for this continent,\u201d which Trump has long demanded since his first term in office.\n\n\"indifferent to the fate of Europe\"\n\nGermany's Friedrich Merz who is slated to be the next chancellor following the country\u2019s elections on Sunday, said that it might be time for Europe to seek \u201cindependence\u201d from the United States on defense.\n\n\u201cAfter Donald Trump\u2019s statements last week, it is clear that the Americans, at least this part of the Americans, this administration, are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe,\u201d Merz said in an interview, according to Politico. In the past, Merz has proposed a new defense alliance, separate from NATO, as U.S. engagement in Europe declines.\n\n\u201cWe must prepare for the worst-case scenario,\u201d he said. \u201cOne in which American engagement in European security significantly declines.\u201d But Merz does not necessarily see this as an existential threat to Germany\u2019s alliance with the United States.\n\nIn fact, Merz has floated several policies for Germany that may give Trump exactly what he wants: NATO allies that spend more on their own defense and take on a greater role in European security. For example, Merz has proposed a European security alliance separate from NATO that would take on issues vital to the continent\u2019s security, but which are less important for the United States.\n\nMerz made clear that he does not believe that any European efforts should replace the longstanding alliance with the United States, however, stating in an interview that he believes a strong stand by a united Europe could keep the United States engaged.\n\n\u201cKeeping our alliance with the U.S. intact is vital,\u201d Merz said. \u201cNATO is not just a military pact, it\u2019s a political alliance built on shared values: democracy, open societies, and market economies. I sincerely hope we can continue to uphold these principles together.\u201d\n\nItaly\n\nItaly\u2019s leader Giorgia Meloni, a strong ideological ally of President Trump, invoked shared values in a virtual speech delivered directly to Trump\u2019s core supporters gathered at the Conservative Political Action Conference last weekend near Washington, D.C. in which she urged conservatives to continue supporting Ukraine and work to secure a long-lasting peace with the cooperation of Europe.\n\n\u201cYou cannot defend your freedom if you lack the means or the courage to do so. Happiness depends on freedom and freedom depends on courage. We proved this when we stopped invasions, won our independences, and overthrew dictators,\u201d Meloni said. \u201cAnd we have done it together the last three years in Ukraine, where a proud people fight for their freedom against the brutal aggression.\u201d\n\nMeloni said that achieving a \u201ca just and lasting peace\u201d requires it being \u201cbuilt with the contribution of all,\u201d emphasizing that peace cannot be achieved without European cooperation.\n\nHer remarks also appeared to include a veiled warning to her ally, comparing a potential abandonment of Ukraine to President Biden\u2019s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, from which his administration never fully recovered.\n\n\u201cAnd I know that with Donald Trump leading the United States we will never again see the disaster we saw in Afghanistan four years ago,\u201d Meloni said.\n\nPeacekeeping forces\n\nFrance\u2019s Macron and the United Kingdom\u2019s Prime Minister Kier Starmer reportedly have begun to develop a plan that would see 30,000 European peacekeepers deployed to Ukraine if a ceasefire is signed with Russia, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn his meeting with Macron, Trump said he approved of the idea, likely seeing it as a way to provide security guarantees that Ukraine seeks without using U.S. troops directly. Macron and Starmer, who is set to visit Washington himself on Thursday, both believe that a U.S. \u201cbackstop\u201d would be necessary to protect European troops in Ukraine and to deter Russia from violating a potential ceasefire.\n\nTrump gave no indication whether U.S. troops would be involved in the plan, but said he believed the European forces would be enough to secure the peace.\n\n\u201cAnd a lot of the European countries, I think I don't want to speak for France, but I know that the [French] president's talked about doing that also, I think that'll be a very good day when we can go in as peacekeepers, as opposed to what's going on right now with everybody being killed,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cAnd I don't think you're going to need much backing. I think that's not going to be a problem. Once an agreement is signed, Russia is going to get back to its business, and Ukraine and Europe are going to get back to their business. I don't think it's going to be a problem,\u201d he said.",

        "full_text": "Like a child custody battle in a throuple, U.S. tech companies are getting pulled in three directions as the Trump administration abandons its predecessor's tacit tolerance, if not always explicit approval, for official censorship in the European Union and Brazil.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission joined the Federal Communications Commission in pressuring Big Tech to back off content moderation that allegedly suppresses conservative speech and challenges to establishment narratives compared to other speech, an evolution of the agencies' history of turf wars on internet policy issues.\n\nPresident Trump issued another sweeping executive order Friday that includes investigating and countering U.K. and EU policies that may have \"the effect of requiring or incentivizing the use or development\" of U.S.-made products and services \"in ways that undermine freedom of speech and political engagement or otherwise moderate content.\"\n\nTrump Media and Technology Group, home of the president's Truth Social, and video platform Rumble also got a reprieve from a federal court in their lawsuit against Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes for his censorship orders.\n\nU.S. District Judge Mary Scriven, nominated by President George W. Bush, ruled that Moraes didn't follow the Hague Convention or the countries' Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty in issuing his orders, so the plaintiffs didn't need a temporary restraining order to stop him.\n\n\"Censorship by technology platforms is not just un-American, it is potentially illegal,\" the FTC said, issuing a request for information that seeks public comment on consumer harm from \"potentially unfair or deceptive acts or practices, or potentially unfair methods of competition,\" and specifically input from \"current and former employees of technology platforms.\"\n\nIt asks for circumstances under which platforms have shadowbanned and demonetized users based on their speech and affiliations, what their \"public-facing representations\" said about moderation and whether users could appeal sanctions, what influenced such adverse actions and how they may have been enabled by lack of competition or weakened competition.\n\n\"Tech firms should not be bullying their users\" into silencing themselves based on viewpoint, said FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson, who was first appointed to the commission by President Biden and confirmed by the Senate less than a year ago.\n\nRoughly 1,000 comments had already been filed by Wednesday afternoon in a proceeding that runs through May 21, many without real names and either critical of the proceeding or implying President Trump and X owner Elon Musk are the real threat to free speech.\n\n\"The Trumpsters are censoring our ability to say Gulf of Mexico, he//him, etc.,\" commenter \"Andrew Ferguson\" wrote, referring to Trump's tiff with the over the renamed \"Gulf of America\" and reported ban on federal employees listing their gender pronouns.\n\nIt appears to be the Trump FTC's first confirmed shot across the bow at Big Tech, arriving late to the party started by cell tower-climbing FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, dubbed a Trump \"sycophant\" by House Judiciary Committee Ranking Democrat Jamie Raskin for reinstating complaints against broadcast networks for their election coverage decisions including editing.\n\nLess than two weeks after the election, Trump-nominated Commissioner Carr said the \"censorship cartel\" that silenced Americans, with help from an \"Orwellian\" purported fact-checker, \"must be dismantled and destroyed.\"\n\nIn letters to Google and Facebook parent companies as well as Microsoft and Apple, Carr said their work with NewsGuard, a rating system for news and information websites, might not be in \"good faith,\" the condition for legal immunity under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.\n\nApple also has to fend off increasing attacks from conservative rabble-rousers.\n\nIt defeated four resolutions at its annual shareholder meeting this week including transparency on how it fights child sexual abuse material and its relationships with activists such as the Human Rights Campaign, which requires companies to pay for so-called gender affirming care for minors to perform well on its Corporate Equality Index.\n\nThe Alliance Defending Freedom, which helped lead the shareholder efforts, called it a win because \"this is the beginning of a conversation,\" in the words of Senior Vice President of corporate engagement Jeremy Tedesco.\n\n\"Apple has budged\" in response to their resolution against diversity, equity and inclusion \"and I think there's more budging to be done,\" Bowyer Research President Jerry Bowyer said, noting that Apple CEO Tim Cook suggested that legal changes may force it to recant DEI.\n\nThe FCC's Carr is a long-term skeptic of the breadth of Section 230 immunity as determined by courts, cheering President Biden's interest in \"removing Big Tech\u2019s special Section 230 protections\" in 2022 while suggesting ways to avoid \"encouraging even more censorship.\"\n\nNew York Post business columnist Charles Gasparino said investors should prepare for Big Tech stocks tanking if Carr's \"inchoate\" plan for Section 230 regulatory review gets fleshed out as an advisory opinion that weakens or eliminates the liability shield on the grounds that platforms are no longer \"blind arbiter[s] of information.\"\n\nGasparino sees a \"good chance\" many courts, especially with conservative jurists, will rely on FCC guidance in Section 230 cases, giving new life to defamation claims against Big Tech, granting expensive legal discovery and prompting settlements.\n\nThe columnist buttressed his take by pointing to Section 230 caselaw in Silicon Valley's 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which most recently stripped immunity from Facebook in a class-action lawsuit against its algorithm discerning users' protected characteristics and letting advertisers discriminate in whom they target with housing ads based on those characteristics.\n\nCarr confirmed Big Tech scrutiny will be a hallmark of his chairmanship by hiring law professor Adam Candeub, long a vocal critic of Section 230 as interpreted by courts, as general counsel of the agency, the position Carr held before his elevation to commissioner.\n\nCarr also praised Trump's nomination of ex-FTC lawyer Gail Slater, onetime policy chief for the since-disbanded Internet Association, as Justice Department antitrust division chief, who will \"help rein in Big Tech and put an end to their abusive and anticompetitive practices.\"\n\nThe FTC and DOJ have their own history of turf wars, and Ferguson told staff last week he wanted the two \"singing from the same song sheet\" when it comes to merger reviews. He said it's better to keep the Biden administration's joint 2023 guidelines rather than spark a \"recriminatory cycle of partisan rescissions\" that harm business and confuse courts.\n\nThe first-month moves by the Trump-appointed chairmen coincide with the president's Feb. 18 executive order to exert more control over the FTC, FCC and Securities and Exchange Commission, which the order calls \"so-called independent agencies\" whose economy-straining rules and regulations have long escaped direct presidential review.",

        "full_text": "Before the Trump administration closed USAID\u2019s doors, the agency regularly routed funding to causes aligned with George Soros\u2019 nonprofit empire, terrorists and drag queens.\n\nThe agency came under scrutiny from the new administration over failures to ensure transparency in its funding to organizations across the globe and concerns that the leadership was not responding to explicit policy directives from the State Department and the wider executive branch to align its programs with Trump policies and the U.S. national interest.\n\nIn recent days, the Trump administration identified USAID programs ranging from contraceptives for Afghanistan to LGBT diversity programs for European countries as clear evidence that foreign aid needed to be paused and reevaluated, a task that fell to the Rubio State Department.\n\nThe development agency for years also funneled money to several nonprofit groups that also received substantial backing from components of George Soros\u2019 empire. Some previously came under scrutiny during the Obama administration for \u201cdemocracy promotion\u201d and judicial reform efforts in European countries that critics claimed promoted leftist politics.\n\nFor example, U.S. government spending records show that the East-West Management Institute, which is in part backed by Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations, received more than $260 million over the years in grants from USAID to, among other things, promote the rule of law in Georgia, strengthen civil society in Uganda, and advance Serbia\u2019s accession talks with the European Union.\n\nThat same nonprofit group came under scrutiny during the Obama administration after Judicial Watch uncovered government records and communications showing that the East-West Management Institute\u2019s \u201cJustice for All\u201d campaign in Albania received $9 million in funding from USAID.\n\nThe assistance concerned several GOP Senators, who sent a letter to the newly appointed Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in 2017, alleging the campaign funded by the U.S. government helped craft an Albanian judicial reform proposal that may \u201cgive the Prime Minister and left-of-center government full control over the judiciary.\u201d\n\nThose same Senators also raised concerns about a similar Soros-backed program in neighboring Macedonia where they said a local affiliate called Foundation Open Society-Macedonia received backing from USAID through the Open Society Foundations and pushed \u201ca progressive agenda.\u201d\n\nOther Soros-backed organizations that received funding from both his Open Society Foundations network and USAID include the Anti-Corruption Action Center in Ukraine and Transparency International.\n\nAccording to the group's own records, the Anti-Corruption Action Center began receiving funding from USAID the same year the Maidan Revolution overthrew Ukraine\u2019s elected, Russian-friendly President Viktor Yanukovych. The group, by its own admission, was heavily critical of Yanukovych\u2019s government and ministers, which aligned with U.S. State Department policy at the time. During the 2014 Maidan Revolution, then-Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland visited Ukraine and was recorded on a leaked phone call discussing how the United States could influence the formation of a new government in Kyiv.\n\nGeorge Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAfter temporarily shutting down USAID operation, the Trump administration defended the move, citing other left-wing causes that received funding grants from the agency. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt highlighted several when speaking with reporters on Monday, including $1.5 million for diversity measures in Serbia, $32,000 for a \u201ctransgender comic book\u201d in Peru, and $70,000 for a DEI musical in Ireland.\n\nHouse Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Brian Mast, R-Fla., also flagged other examples of USAID funding, including $15 million for condoms sent to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and over $3 million for \u201cbeing LGBTQ in the Caribbean.\u201d\n\nThe government watchdog overseeing the agency also warned USAID\u2019s leadership in a stinging January memo that it had created serious \"vulnerabilities\" by doling out billions of tax dollars to overseas countries and groups without fulling vetting for terrorists. That inspector general\u2019s report also determined that USAID grants were being insufficiently monitored.\n\nIn one egregious example, a Syrian national was charged by the Justice Department last year for diverting more than $9 million worth of humanitarian aid paid for by USAID to a designated terrorist group affiliated with Al-Qaeda in Iraq.\n\nThe suspect, Mahmoud Al Hafyan, was the head of a Syrian nongovernmental organization that employed 160 individuals and was awarded $122 million by USAID between January 2015 and November 2018, according to the Justice Department. That money was designated to pay for food kits for Syrian refugees fleeing conflict zones.\n\nDuring this contract, the Justice Department alleges Al Hafyan worked with co-conspirators to funnel \u201cmillions\u201d in food kits on the black market to the Al-Nusra Front, a local Al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria that is also designated a terrorist organization by the United States.\n\nThe USAID inspector general warned about the limits on the agency\u2019s ability to monitor expenditures for programs in \u201cnonpermissive\u201d environments, like the conflict zones in Syria, meaning what happened there could happen in other places, like Ukraine or Gaza, where there are similar international or local organizations operating that are recipients of U.S. cash.",

        "full_text": "Congress is careening toward a government shutdown in just 11 days as the discord between the two parties over funding talks grows, with no clear path to reach a deal.\n\nThe government is set to run out of money at the end of next Friday, March 14. Republicans control the House and the Senate, but they need Democratic support to pass a funding bill as it is subject to the Senate's 60-vote threshold.\n\nHopes of a full funding deal have faded, so President Donald Trump and congressional leaders are falling back on a short-term bill to keep the government open on autopilot, most likely through the end of the fiscal year. But even that is running into obstacles.\n\n\"I'm not optimistic. I don't think we're going to have a budget,\" said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. \"My Democratic colleagues have been insistent that we include language limiting the involvement of the executive branch on spending decisions.\"\n\nDemocrats have pushed to include constraints on Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk's attempts to close down or slash agencies without congressional approval. But Republicans say that's a nonstarter as they support the Department of Government Efficiency-led budget cuts, which they say are about rooting out waste.\n\n\"Democrats have to help negotiate this, and they've to this point shown no interest in finding a reasonable solution for that,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Sunday on 's \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nJohnson called for a measure \"to freeze funding at current levels, to make sure that the government can stay open while we begin to incorporate all these savings that we're finding through the DOGE effort and these other sources of revenue that President Trump's policies are bringing to the table.\"\n\nIn a statement Sunday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Democrats are interested in a deal that \"promotes the economic well-being, health and safety of everyday Americans.\" But he added that \"there has been zero outreach from the Trump administration and House Republicans have walked away from the negotiating table.\"\n\nThe White House sent Congress a request for add-ons to the bill \u2014 or \"anomalies\" \u2014 that include $32 billion in transfer authority for the Defense Department, which some Democrats consider a slush fund. The request includes a $20 billion cut to IRS enforcement and an increase in funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation operations. The document was viewed by News and authenticated by two sources.\n\n\"I think the White House anomaly requests are completely inadequate,\" Sen. Patty Murray, of Washington, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said Monday when she was asked about the request. \"And again, the solution is in front of us: short-term CR, tell our committee to get to work. Democrats are at the table. We are ready to do that.\"\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the chair of the Appropriations Committee, told News on Monday that she's \"working on a two-track approach\" that includes a full-year continuing resolution and a short-term bill of \"maybe a month\" to give more time for a detailed agreement.\n\nFor Johnson, the first question is whether he can find enough votes to pass a stopgap bill in the House with a narrow GOP majority of 218-215. That may require Democratic votes as scores of conservative Republicans routinely vote against funding the government.\n\nOrdinarily, Democrats support short-term bills en masse. But this time, the GOP's insistence on protecting or codifying the cuts by DOGE has given Democrats a point of opposition to rally around \u2014 after they've seen grassroots anger from federal workers and veterans. Democrats see the Trump-Musk effort as trampling on Congress' power over spending, and some say they won't support a bill that would let it continue.\n\nIn addition, at least two moderate House Republicans have already blasted the idea of another continuing resolution.\n\nRep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, argued that Congress needs to pass regular appropriation bills rather than kick the can down the road with a CR.\n\n\"I am a NO on the CR. Congress needs to do its job and pass a conservative budget!\" he wrote on X. \"CR's are code for Continued Rubberstamp of fraud, waste, and abuse.\"\n\nRep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., an Afghanistan and Iraq war veteran, slammed the CR, saying it wouldn't allow for much-needed additional military funding.\n\n\"A continuing resolution (CR) is bad for our military and weakens our national security,\" Bacon wrote Sunday on X, without saying how he'd vote. \"A CR means new weapons programs cannot get started. A year-long CR means we are not serious about building a military that will deter China, Russia and Iran.\"\n\nBut Bacon said Monday that White House officials reached out to him after his post and acknowledged that \"anomalies\" were needed to \"plus-up\" military spending.\n\nJohnson huddled with his GOP leadership team as lawmakers returned to the Capitol on Monday evening and got support for the CR plan.\n\nRep. Andy Harris, R-Md., the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, said he was on board, even though the stopgap measure doesn't codify the DOGE cuts cheered by the ultraconservative group. All Freedom Caucus members voted last week to pass a budget resolution that calls for raising the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.\n\n\"I think we're charting new territory here with President Trump and his striving to get government efficiency going,\" Harris said as he left the speaker's office.\n\nAsked whether he's worried about a shutdown, Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., a Freedom Caucus member, replied: \"Nah.\"\n\n\"This town is very interesting. Deals seem to, like, fall out of the sky when they need to,\" Donalds told News while saying \"the Dems are being ridiculous\" by opposing DOGE cuts.\n\nRepublicans are seeking to juggle a funding bill with an unrelated effort to pass a huge party-line package to advance parts of Trump's agenda, which has drawn unified Democratic opposition.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said Democrats will continue \"telling the truth about what the Republicans are trying to do\" and said it's the majority party's job to make a serious offer.\n\n\"The Republicans have the majority,\" Warren told reporters Monday. \"They need to put forward a package that can pass the House and the Senate. That's their job.\"",

        "full_text": "Eli Lilly on Wednesday said it will invest at least $27 billion to build four new manufacturing sites in the U.S., as demand for its blockbuster weight loss and diabetes injections soars and the company develops new drugs for other conditions.\n\nIt comes as drugmakers and companies across different industries work to build goodwill with President Donald Trump, who has emphasized reshoring manufacturing to the U.S. and reducing reliance on foreign supply chains. He has threatened companies \u2014 and pharmaceutical businesses in particular \u2014 with tariffs if they do not manufacture products in the U.S.\n\nEli Lilly made the announcement at an event in Washington, D.C. \u2014 emphasizing the political undertones of the strategy. The event featured several speakers from the Trump administration, including Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who explicitly tied the announcement to Trump's policies.\n\nLutnick said the investment is \"exactly what the Trump administration is all about, which is building and manufacturing and reshoring in America, investing in America, building in America.\" He thanked Eli Lilly for \"doing exactly what the president was hoping would happen.\"\n\nLutnick added that \"if you want to understand the tariff policy\" of the U.S., \"I have just articulated it.\"\n\nThe move brings Eli Lilly's total U.S. manufacturing investments to more than $50 billion in recent years. The other $23 billion is from the company's investments in new plants and site expansions since 2020, which has helped ease supply shortages of its popular drugs.\n\n\"This represents the largest pharmaceutical expansion investment in U.S. history,\" Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said at the event. \"We're making these investments ... to prepare for the demand we anticipate for future pipeline medicines across our therapeutic areas.\"\n\nShares of the company closed more than 1% higher on Wednesday.\n\nThree of the future U.S. sites announced Wednesday will manufacture active ingredients in medications, such as tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly's obesity drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro. Ricks noted that there is a \"real gap in supply chain in the U.S. as it relates to active ingredient availability in our country.\"\n\nThe fourth site will extend the company's global manufacturing network for future injectable therapies, he added.\n\nEli Lilly has not decided on where the four new U.S. sites will be located, Ricks said. The company will be accepting location submissions through March 13 and will announce decisions on new sites in the coming months.\n\nEli Lilly said the four new sites will create more than 3,000 jobs for workers such as engineers and scientists, along with 10,000 construction jobs as the plants are built. The company's other U.S. plants include sites in North Carolina, Indiana and Wisconsin.\n\nThe new investments aren't solely dedicated to Eli Lilly's current and future obesity and diabetes treatments. The company is charting its future beyond Zepbound and Mounjaro, with hopes to deliver drugs from its broad pipeline of products for cancer, Alzheimer's disease and other conditions.\n\nRicks said the company is optimistic about its pipeline across therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic health, oncology, immunology and neuroscience.\n\nStill, the new investments build on the success of Zepbound and Mounjaro, which share dominance of the booming market for so-called GLP-1 drugs with Novo Nordisk 's weight loss drug Wegovy and diabetes treatment Ozempic. Some analysts expect the global obesity drug market to be worth more than $150 billion annually by the early 2030s, making it critical for both companies to maintain their share as other drugmakers scramble to join.\n\nDuring the event, Ricks took a shot at cheaper compounded versions of its injectable drugs, saying \"America faces a growing threat from an influx of counterfeit and compounded medications.\"\n\nEli Lilly's efforts to boost the supply of Zepbound and Mounjaro aim to ensure that eligible patients are safely accessing those branded treatments instead of cheaper compounded versions. Patients flocked to those unapproved copycats when the branded drugs were in short supply, or if they didn't have insurance coverage for the costly treatments.\n\nThe FDA has since declared the shortage of tirzepatide over, which will essentially bar many compounding pharmacies from making copycats.\n\nHassett said the issue also \"disturbs the White House\" because offshore producers of copycat drugs are \"threatening lives in the U.S.\"",

        "full_text": "watch now\n\nLONDON \u2014 The European Union is expected to announce \"concrete\" measures on boosting defense financing this week, sources told , as Europe and the United States clash over support for Ukraine.\n\nThe 27 EU leaders will gather in Brussels on Thursday for a meeting dedicated to defense and support for Ukraine. It follows two particularly tense moments in U.S.-Europe relations: Vice President JD Vance's speech in Munich in mid-February when he criticized European leaders; and the on-the-record clash between the U.S. administration and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on Friday.\n\nEuropean leaders are trying not to alienate President Donald Trump after he criticized Zelenskyy for \"gambling\" over a potential World War III. At the same time, Europeans know they have to take immediate action to ensure that Ukraine continues to receive the support it needs \u2014 and any further aggression from Russian President Vladimir Putin is prevented.\n\n\"There will be intense work in the coming days,\" an EU official, who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the discussions but is part of the preparations for Thursday's meeting, told Monday.\n\nThe same official said the aim is to announce \"concrete deliverables\" on the financing of defense.\n\nTraders will be watching the talks between EU officials closely. The European Stoxx Aerospace and Defense index has risen almost 23% in the year to date as investors bet on spending hikes, and was over 6% higher in Monday morning trade.\n\nwatch now\n\nTrump has often criticized European nations for failing to spend 2% of their GDP on defense, as stipulated by NATO rules. Since Trump's first term, several countries have increased their defense spending and the latest NATO figures indicate that 23 of the 32 members are expected to have achieved the 2% target in 2024.\n\nNow, many NATO members are looking to increase spending even more, with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte telling in February that the figure will have to be \"much more than than 2%.\" Trump, meanwhile, has called for 5% of GDP as the NATO contribution target.\n\nHow to spend more on defense\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced in February that EU fiscal rules will be updated to allow countries to spend more on defense without being constrained by specific debt and deficit targets.\n\nThe unnamed EU official told that the next announcement will go even further. \"We are looking at additional funding for defense at the EU level, including through flexibility in the use of structural funds and adaptation of the EIB mandate,\" the official said.\n\nThe European Investment Bank, which is targeting 95 billion euros ($99.26 billion) in investments in 2025, is currently constrained to only financing dual-use defense projects, which means they have to have both civil and military purposes.\n\nA second EU official, who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the talks, confirmed to Monday that Von der Leyen is expected to present \"concrete measures\" in terms of defense financing in the coming days. These will then be discussed by EU leaders on Thursday.\n\nRoman Pilipey | Afp | \n\n\"We urgently have to rearm Europe. And for that I will present a comprehensive plan to the leaders on how to rearm Europe on 6 March when we have our European Council,\" von der Leyen said at a summit in London on Sunday.\n\nIn a recent report called \"Defending Europe without the U.S.,\" Brussels-based think tank Bruegel calculated that Europe could need \"300,000 more troops and an annual defence spending hike of at least 250 billion euros in the short term to deter Russian aggression.\"\n\nGoldman Sachs, meanwhile, said in a note Sunday that \"in the absence of offsetting fiscal measures, the Euro area needs to fund an additional 0.6% of GDP annually to meet the defence spending target at 2.5%.\"\n\nOne key question is whether the EU will go so far as to agree to common borrowing for defense projects. The bloc decided to take that unprecedented step in 2020 in the wake of the pandemic (known as NextGenerationEU) and some member states believe this should be replicated for defense spending. However, more fiscally conservative nations want to exhaust other options before taking that step.\n\nAccording to Goldman Sachs, EU leaders could \"repurpose\" the outstanding financial capacity from the NextGenerationEU funds for defense. They could then look at a new program, which \"could provide stable funding shielding defence spending from idiosyncratic national factors,\" the analysts added.",

There were no abstentions.\n\nMore than two thirds of parliament were needed to support the package in order for it to pass. The law also needs to be approved by the Bundesrat, a body representing the country's states, on Friday to become enshrined in Germany's constitution.\n\nUnder the proposed new laws, defense and certain security expenditures above a certain threshold would no longer be subject to the debt brake, which limits how much debt the government can take on and dictates the size of the federal government's structural budget deficit.\n\nLoans taken on as part of the infrastructure fund would also be exempt from the debt brake, while Germany's states would also have greater flexibility around debt.\n\nCarsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, on Tuesday said the vote meant the debt brake rule is now \"not officially dead but buried alive.\"\n\n\"Germany has given up on leading the group of fiscal frugals in Europe for the sake of boosting its economy,\" he added.\n\nThe Christian Democratic Union, alongside its sister party the Christian Social Union, which jointly won the largest share of votes in Germany's national election in February, proposed the fiscal shift in collaboration with the Social Democratic Party. The factions appear likely to form the incoming coalition government, with the fiscal reform package a by-product of talks about a potential governing partnership between them.\n\nA tight vote\n\nTime pressure to pass the reforms is high as they require changes to the constitution and need the support of two thirds of both parliament and the Bundesrat.\n\nThis was likely only going to be possible before the newly elected parliament comes together for the first time next week, as parties opposing the fiscal package will then have a larger share of the vote and could potentially block the plans.\n\nSeveral of the parties that oppose the reforms have also unsuccessfully launched legal challenges to hinder the vote.\n\nLiesa Johannssen | \n\nIn the lead-up to the Tuesday vote, the CDU-CSU and SPD also had to negotiate for the backing of Germany's Green Party, ultimately agreeing on a compromise that includes 100 billion euros of the infrastructure fund being allocated to climate and economic transformation efforts and a broadening of the security-related issues exempted from the debt brake.\n\nA boost to the economy?\n\nAnalysts and economists have broadly reacted positively to the reform plans, viewing them as a potentially major boost for Germany's struggling economy.\n\nRobin Winkler, chief German economist at Deutsche Bank Research, urged caution, however, suggesting there was still work to be done for the incoming government.\n\n\"This is a historic fiscal regime shift, arguably the largest since German reunification,\" he said Tuesday after the vote. \"Yet, as with reunification, a fiscal expansion does not guarantee success: the next government will need to deliver structural reforms to turn this fiscal package into sustainable growth.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nThe German economy narrowly skirted a technical recession \u2014 or two consecutive quarters of economic contraction \u2014 throughout 2023 and 2024, but has been effectively stagnant.\n\nThe OECD on Monday said it was now projecting Germany's gross domestic product to grow by an annual 0.4% this year, down from the previously forecast 0.7% expansion. German economic institute Ifo, meanwhile, said it was cutting its outlook for the country's economy to 0.2% growth year-on-year.\n\nIt comes as Germany is facing sustained infrastructure problems, as well as issues in key industries such as housebuilding and autos. The country is also battling the threat of potential tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump on imports to the U.S. from Europe \u2014 which could be especially difficult for Germany due to its high levels of trade with the U.S.",

And the high court is likely to have the final say on whether Trump has the power to dismiss the special counsel.\n\n has requested comment from Dellinger and his attorneys.\n\nDellinger, who had a five-year term, was appointed as special counsel in March 2024 by then-President Joe Biden, and later confirmed by the Senate.\n\nTrump fired Dellinger by email last month as part of a wide-ranging effort to reduce the number of federal workers.\n\nDellinger's office is responsible for protecting federal employees who act as whistleblowers about illegal or unethical conduct.\n\nDellinger sued the Trump administration in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., over his termination.\n\nHe argued his dismissal was illegal because of a federal law that says special counsels can only be removed by the president \"for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance of office.\"\n\nDistrict Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson on Feb. 10 issued an order barring Dellinger's removal as the case continued.\n\nThe Trump administration then appealed to the Court of Appeals, which in a 2-1 ruling declined to overturn Berman's order.\n\nThe Department of Justice then asked the Supreme Court to rule that Trump had the power to fire Dellinger. But the Supreme Court declined to do so, for now, letting the case wind its way through lower federal courts.\n\nBerman then ruled on Saturday that Trump's firing was unlawful.\n\n\"The Special Counsel's job is to look into and expose unethical or unlawful practices directed at federal civil servants, and to help ensure that whistleblowers who disclose fraud, waste, and abuse on the part of government agencies can do so without suffering reprisals,\" Jackson wrote in her ruling.\n\n\"It would be ironic, to say the least, and inimical to the ends furthered by the statute if the Special Counsel himself could be chilled in his work by fear of arbitrary or partisan removal,\" Jackson wrote.\n\nThe DOJ immediately asked the Court of Appeals in an emergency motion to stay Jackson's ruling pending the outcome of its appeal of that decision.\n\nIn its order Wednesday, the three judges on the appeals court panel said the Trump administration had \"satisfied the stringent requirements for a stay pending appeal.\"\n\n\"This order gives effect to the removal of appellee [Dellinger] from his position as Special Counsel of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel,\" the order noted.\n\nIn the weeks since Trump first tried to fire Dellinger, the special counsel had opposed the president's efforts to fire probationary employees across several federal agencies.",

        "full_text": "In almost every way, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will walk into the White House on Thursday as an alien in President Donald Trump\u2019s MAGA universe: a former human rights lawyer, a onetime top prosecutor and, after vanquishing Conservatives in elections last summer, the United Kingdom\u2019s most liberal leader in more than a decade.\n\nStarmer arrives already in the crosshairs of Trump adviser Elon Musk, who has derided him on social media as a warrior of wokeism leading Britain toward inevitable civil war (not to mention being \u201ccomplicit\u201d in mass pedophilia).\n\nBut Starmer is betting the future of U.S.-U.K. relations on milder first words from Trump himself. The president said last month that he had a good relationship with Starmer and, while they differed on \u201cphilosophy,\u201d that the Labour Party leader who took office in July had done \u201ca very good job so far.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich reception he finds, as Trump continues to upend transatlantic relations, will help determine how Britain \u2014 and Europe \u2014 navigates the insurgent president\u2019s upheavals in trade, disparagement of NATO and abrupt lurch toward Russia in the three-year-old war in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty defining moment, which Trump he meets and how it goes down,\u201d said a British official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to publicly discuss internal deliberations. \u201cWhat happens over the next few weeks will determine how Keir is viewed as a world leader and how the relationship evolves.\u201d\n\nStarmer will be battling not just for Britain\u2019s standing in Trump\u2019s Washington, but Europe\u2019s, as well. The prime minister has offered himself as a bridge between the White House and Continental capitals reeling from the president\u2019s threats to unwind four generations of American security backing to such a degree that Germany\u2019s presumptive next chancellor said NATO could be finished in its current form by the summer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike other leaders, Starmer approaches the mercurial Trump by trying to walk a line between agreeable and acquiescent, flattery and fealty.\n\nStarmer told Parliament on Tuesday that his government would fast-track a hike in defense spending to reach 2.5 percent of GDP by 2027 \u2014 an additional 13.4 billion pounds, or $17 billion a year, that would put Britain on a path to 3 percent in the coming years, the prime minister said. The spike is in line with Trump\u2019s demand that NATO members spend more on their own defense and rely less on Washington\u2019s military might.\n\nAnd in cutting Britain\u2019s modest foreign aid budget to help fund the military boost, Starmer echoed priorities set by Trump, who spent his first weeks in office dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nOn Ukraine, the prime minister praised the president\u2019s head-spinning about-face in favor of Russia for shaking up the conversation and creating new opportunities for ending the war. He pledged British troops as part of a potential international force sent to help secure a negotiated peace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Starmer shows flashes of defiance. He has insisted that Ukraine and Europe must not be sidelined in talks with Russia and that U.S. backing will be \u201cvital\u201d for any multinational security force. Starmer insists that Ukraine remain a candidate for NATO membership, a possibility ruled off-the-table by Trump\u2019s defense secretary.\n\nAnd Starmer rejected outright Trump\u2019s depiction of Ukraine as the aggressor and President Volodymyr Zelensky as a \u201cdictator,\u201d leading a chorus of support for Zelensky that stretched across Britain\u2019s political spectrum. On Monday, Britain announced more than 100 new sanctions against Russia, its largest wave of injunctions since the early days of the invasion.\n\nStarmer will file into the Oval Office three days after French President Emmanuel Macron. Starmer and Macron, who is driving the push for European countries to commit troops to a Ukraine security force, are coordinating their Trump strategies, aides said.\n\n\u201cOur efforts are convergent, concordant and complementary,\u201d said an Elys\u00e9e official, speaking on the condition of anonymity in line with French government protocol.\n\nIn Britain, the question is whether Starmer, with a personality more technocratic than colorful, will be able to show flashes of the bro-bonhomie that have enlivened Macron\u2019s up-and-down relations with Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStarmer is known for his methodical, some would say ruthless, rise through the ranks of Labour. Without much in the way of oratory or ideology, he deposed his more liberal boss Jeremy Corbyn and dragged the party to the center. Last year, he ended 14 years of Conservative rule with a relentless focus on delivering competent government and \u201cchange.\u201d\n\nRarely does he show strong reactions to the inevitable personal attacks that come with politics, a flatness that may serve him well in dealings with Team Trump.\n\nHe initially waved away Musk\u2019s charge last month that he was \u201ccomplicit in the rape of Britain\u201d for allegedly failing as a crown prosecutor to investigate immigrant gangs accused of grooming and assaulting girls. Only after the story continued to build did Starmer publicly condemn the charges as \u201clies\u201d and detail his successful prosecutions against the gangs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cKeir is absolutely unflappable, he\u2019s levelheaded,\u201d said Josh Simons, a Labour member of Parliament. \u201cThat makes him unusually well suited in terms of his temperament to be a bridge between Trump and Europe.\u201d\n\nThere is a long history of Britain trying \u2014 with varying success \u2014 to be a conduit between the United States and Europe. Some American and British leaders have hit it off; others less so.\n\nMargaret Thatcher once said that Ronald Reagan was \u201cthe second-most important man\u201d in her life after her husband. Barack Obama looked to the continent for his \u201cclosest ally,\u201d which is how he described German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nStill, it\u2019s hard to imagine Starmer and Trump sharing the personal chemistry of Tony Blair and Bill Clinton, said Rob Ford, a politics expert at the University of Manchester.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t going to ever be golfing buddies,\u201d Ford said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what\u2019s being asked of him. Starmer is the kind of politician who will do whatever it takes in order to win, and winning in this case means having influence with the U.S. and being a bridge with Europe.\u201d\n\nOther transatlantic experts said it would be a mistake to rely on outdated nostalgia for past heydays of a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with Washington.\n\nTrump may have more of a soft spot for Britain than Musk does, with the golf courses he owns in Scotland and a known fondness for royal family pomp (an invitation to visit King Charles at Balmoral Castle is already in the works, according to British media reports).\n\nBut Trump\u2019s early actions suggest he is less likely than ever to be flattered off his drive to remake Western alliances, said Tim Bale, a politics professor at Queen Mary University of London. Trump \u201cis going to do what he wants to do, whether Starmer sucks up to him or not.\u201d\n\nEllen Francis in Brussels contributed to this report.",

        "full_text": "The U.S. Justice Department told Congress in November that there were no major disputes with the United Kingdom over how the two allies seek data from each other\u2019s communication companies.\n\nBut at that time, officials knew British authorities were preparing a demand that Apple build a back door to its users\u2019 encrypted data, according to people familiar with the process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal department matters.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on Tuesday called that British demand an \u201cegregious\u201d violation of American rights, and on Wednesday lawmakers asked the Justice Department to investigate.\n\nNovember\u2019s report to Congress was required by law to renew an agreement that lets the U.K. obtain electronic data from U.S. providers without going through U.S. courts. In it, the Biden Justice Department certified that U.K. laws and procedures provided \u201crobust substantive and procedural protections for privacy and civil liberties.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSen. Alex Padilla and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, both California Democrats, asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to reexamine that finding, saying Britain\u2019s threat to compromise encryption violated the information-sharing deal between the two countries under the 2018 Cloud Act.\n\n\u201cNo entity, foreign or domestic, should be able to make Americans\u2019 data more susceptible to breaches,\u201d Padilla said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are demanding accountability, not just from other countries, but from the Department of Justice, which has the responsibility to keep Americans\u2019 data safe \u2014 we must not set this terrible precedent.\u201d\n\nThe U.K. ordered Apple in January to create a way for British authorities to obtain content that Apple users store in iCloud with Advanced Data Protection, an encryption option rolled out worldwide two years ago. That content is end-to-end encrypted, meaning only the user, and not Apple, can access it. Apple withdrew the encryption option in the U.K. on Friday rather than comply, an action that would have left its users with less security than they had been promised.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s 10-page report to the Foreign Relations and Judiciary committees of the House and Senate noted that unnamed U.S. companies had complained that the U.K. Investigatory Powers Act required advance notice if they wanted to enhance privacy or security in their services and that Britain could then block those offerings globally.\n\nThe department said it reminded its British counterpart of the Cloud Act\u2019s \u201crequirement that the terms of the Agreement shall not create any obligation that providers be capable of decrypting data.\u201d The report did not mention the looming order, and said any demands for reduced security would come under Britain\u2019s Investigatory Powers Act, and so were not within the scope of the Cloud Act.\n\nThe Justice Department official who conveyed that document to Congress referred questions Wednesday to a department spokeswoman, who said she had nothing to add to the report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Wednesday, Padilla and Lofgren faulted the November certification, saying \u201cit splits the finest of hairs\u201d by suggesting that the Cloud Act didn\u2019t apply to any decryption order. The two lawmakers, who sit on the Judiciary committees in their respective chambers of Congress, asked Bondi to reconsider whether Britain was violating the Cloud Act by ordering a break to Apple\u2019s encryption.\n\nTwo of the people familiar with the certification process said the FBI has pursued backdoor capabilities unsuccessfully in the United States and would have been in a stronger legal position to win that if Apple had already had to create such a mechanism for another government.\n\nThe FBI did not respond to a request for a comment. The U.K. Home Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment and has previously said it does not comment on \u201coperational matters.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGabbard on Tuesday wrote to Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Arizona) saying she had directed a legal review of the order and had not known of it before it was reported by The and confirmed by other publications. The legislators had urged her to act just after her confirmation as the top U.S. intelligence leader.\n\n\u201cI share your grave concern about the serious implications of the United Kingdom, or any foreign country, requiring Apple or any company to create a \u2018backdoor\u2019 that would allow access to Americans\u2019 personal encrypted data,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis would be a clear and egregious violation of Americans\u2019 privacy and civil liberties, and open up a serious vulnerability for cyber exploitation by adversarial actors.\u201d\n\nApple was prohibited from disclosing the order to Congress or U.S. regulators under the Investigatory Powers Act, which allows British officials to compel communications and technology providers to assist in government inquiries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile not addressing the existence of the order, when Apple said it was pulling the secure storage from U.K. customers it added that it had never built a back door into its products and never would.\n\nEven the U.K. pullout would not be enough to end the U.K. demand that the tech giant create the back door for spying on those in other countries. Gabbard\u2019s complaints might do that, and she pledged to keep Congress apprised.\n\nThe Cloud Act cooperative agreement bars the British from deliberately seeking information on Americans, but forcing the creation of a universal back door would create a new target not just for law enforcement officials, but also for hackers and spies.\n\n\u201cAny information sharing between a government \u2014 any government \u2014 and private companies must be done in a manner that respects and protects the U.S. law and the Constitutional rights of U.S. citizens,\u201d Gabbard wrote. \u201cI look forward to ensuring the UK government has taken necessary actions to protect the privacy of American citizens, consistent with the CLOUD Act and other applicable laws.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nU.K. officials and the FBI have complained that the increasing use of end-to-end encryption has stymied investigations into terrorism, child abuse and other serious crimes. Such communications can only be seen by the sending and receiving devices. Apple\u2019s Advanced Data Protection, iMessages and FaceTime are end-to-end encrypted, as are Google Android backups and some chats, Meta\u2019s Messenger and WhatsApp texts, and content sent over Signal.\n\nWhile acknowledging that strong encryption is used by criminals, the vast majority of security professionals and government cyber defenders have endorsed increased adoption as hackers win access to regular emails, text and voice calls.\n\n\u201cDirector Gabbard is right to raise alarm over the UK\u2019s demand for backdoor access to Apple users\u2019 encrypted data,\u201d said Kia Hamadanchy, senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cWhile this might be a British government demand, it will have huge consequences for anyone in the U.S. with an iPhone.\u201d",

        "full_text": "MADISON, Wis. \u2014 President Donald Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk are going all-in on flipping control of Wisconsin\u2019s top court, with Trump endorsing the conservative in the race and Musk\u2019s PAC hunting for votes by offering state residents cash for their contact details.\n\nThe burst of support comes as Trump faces his first test with swing-state voters in the April 1 election since winning a second term in November. The court is expected to decide the future of abortion in the state and could redraw a congressional map that has given Republicans six of the state\u2019s eight seats.\n\nTrump on Friday said on his Truth Social platform that he was backing Brad Schimel, a Waukesha County judge and former Republican state attorney general who is seeking a seat on Wisconsin\u2019s high court. He excoriated the liberal in the race, Dane County Judge Susan Crawford, writing \u201cif she wins, the Movement to restore our Nation will bypass Wisconsin.\u201d\n\nGroups affiliated with Musk have poured more than $13 million into Wisconsin in recent weeks in what is already the most expensive court race in U.S. history. Musk, ranked by Forbes as the world\u2019s richest person, has put a spotlight on the race as he assists Trump with firing government workers and shuttering federal agencies through his U.S. DOGE Service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk dialed up his focus on Wisconsin on Thursday when his America PAC offered registered voters in the state $100 if they provided contact information and signed a petition opposing activist judges. The PAC also offered them $100 for each registered Wisconsin voter they referred to sign the petition \u2014 but the fine print of the offer said the PAC would determine whom to pay and noted payments may not be made for months.\n\nThe payment-for-data arrangement will give Musk\u2019s team an easy way to reach a pool of voters it can bombard with messages urging them to support Schimel in the election. Turnout in Wisconsin court elections is much lower than in presidential elections, and liberals have had a large turnout advantage in recent court races. Political observers for both sides say Schimel\u2019s best chance of success is to get voters who backed Trump in November to the polls.\n\nOn Saturday, Musk hosted Schimel on an audio live stream on X, the social media site owned by Musk. \u201cIf you look at the early voting data so far, Democrats are winning, which is not good,\u201d Musk said.\n\nCrawford\u2019s campaign called Trump and Musk\u2019s support unsurprising and contended Schimel would do their bidding. Crawford and her allies for weeks have decried Musk\u2019s role in the race, with the state Democratic Party holding town-hall-style meetings about the race dubbed \u201cThe People v. Musk.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSchimel has spent his entire career on bent knee to right-wing special interests,\u201d Crawford spokesman Derrick Honeyman said in a statement. \u201cWe assumed he had this endorsement locked up months ago.\u201d\n\nCandidates and independent groups have spent $76 million on the race so far, according to a tally by news site Wispolitics.com. That beats the national record for a court race set two years ago, when liberals gained control of Wisconsin\u2019s top court.\n\nOn the audio live stream, Musk said he got involved in the race because the court\u2019s liberal 4-3 majority may eventually redraw the state\u2019s congressional districts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt could cause the House to switch to Democrat if that redrawing takes place, and then we wouldn\u2019t be able to get through the changes that the American people want,\u201d Musk said.\n\nThere is no pending lawsuit over Wisconsin\u2019s congressional districts, but liberal groups may file one if the court keeps its ideological makeup. Two years ago, liberal voters filed a lawsuit over state legislative districts after the liberals won a majority of the court, and the justices soon struck down maps that had given Republicans large majorities in the state legislature. Under new maps, Democrats made large gains last year.\n\nCrawford met by video in January with a liberal group that billed the race as a chance to redraw the state\u2019s House districts. Crawford has said she didn\u2019t discuss redistricting during the call, but Schimel and Republicans have said the meeting shows what\u2019s at stake if she wins.\n\nMusk and Schimel\u2019s audio live stream included some technical glitches and featured Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin), who contended the court\u2019s liberals could reverse the state\u2019s voter ID law and its restrictions on collective bargaining for most public workers in the state.\n\nThe group did not discuss the two biggest cases on the court\u2019s docket, which together will determine whether abortion will remain legal in the state. The cases are expected to be decided before August when a new justice is sworn in, but they will shape what kind of future abortion litigation could come to the high court. Crawford supports abortion rights; Schimel has long opposed abortion but during the campaign has said he would respect the will of voters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWisconsin clinics stopped offering abortions in 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and ended that ruling\u2019s guarantee of access to abortion. They feared an 1849 state law would prevent them from providing abortions, but they resumed offering them in 2023 after a lower court ruled the law did not apply to them.\n\nThe state Supreme Court is now considering that case along with one that asks whether the state constitution guarantees a right to abortion. Abortion is now allowed for up to 20 weeks in the state.\n\nSchimel, Musk and Johnson also did not mention that Musk\u2019s electric car company, Tesla, sued the state in January after Wisconsin officials barred it from opening dealerships because of a state law that bars car manufacturers from owning dealerships. That case could eventually make it to the state Supreme Court.\n\nMusk called the race important but made light of its timing.\n\n\u201cSuch a fateful election,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s on April Fools\u2019 Day.\u201d",

        "full_text": "The Trump administration on Tuesday re-designated the Houthi militant group in Yemen as a foreign terrorist organization, reversing a decision made by President Joe Biden in 2021, after more than a year of attacks on U.S. Navy and commercial vessels at sea.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement that he was fulfilling one of President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign promises after hundreds of Houthi attacks on vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The Houthis have described their campaign of violence as an act of solidarity with Hamas, the militant group whose attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, triggered a war in Gaza that has upended security across the region.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s action taken by the State Department demonstrates the Trump Administration\u2019s commitment to protecting our national security interests, the safety of the American people, and the security of the United States,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cTerrorist designations play a critical role in our fight against terrorism and are an effective way to curtail support for terrorist activities.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRubio also warned China and other countries that may seek to maintain ties with the Houthis, noting that a recent attack \u201cspared Chinese-flagged ships while targeting American and allied vessels.\u201d The United States, Rubio declared, \u201cwill not tolerate any country engaging with terrorist organizations like the Houthis in the name of practicing legitimate international business.\u201d\n\nThe group, formally known as Ansar Allah, was already the subject of earlier U.S. sanctions and other punitive measures, but the foreign terrorist designation makes it a crime for people or entities such as banks to offer \u201cmaterial support or resources\u201d to the Houthis and bars its members from the United States.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Justice Department said it is offering up to $15 million for information leading to the disruption of the Houthis\u2019 finances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Houthis, a rebel group that seized the Yemeni capital of Sanaa in 2014, function as the de facto government across a wide swath of Yemen, including in many of its most populous areas. Relying heavily on weapons provided by Iran, the Houthis have aligned themselves with other regional militant groups and positioned themselves as a leader of the armed opposition to Israel and the United States.\n\nShortly before departing office in January 2021, the first Trump administration designated the Houthis a foreign terrorist organization, citing cross-border violence into Saudi Arabia and an attack on an airport in Aden, a southern Yemeni city. The Biden administration undid that designation the following month, citing the limitations it placed on delivering humanitarian aid to Yemen, where a decade of civil conflict has fueled severe poverty and malnutrition.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Hamas attack in October 2023, Houthi leaders said they would attack ships associated with Israel. The campaign that followed was often indiscriminate, however, with vessels from a variety of countries targeted and at least a couple that were sunk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Biden administration responded by recruiting partners and allies to join a multinational naval task force to protect shipping and eventually launching airstrikes at the Houthis. Biden administration officials also sought to curtail weapons smuggling from Iran to Yemen, but officials familiar with the issue said that effort was difficult.\n\nThe U.S. military increased its tempo of strikes on Houthi targets in the final weeks of the Biden administration in response to what former U.S. officials said was an increasingly aggressive campaign to strike both Israeli and U.S. assets in the region.\n\nOn Tuesday, Houthi authorities announced they had shot down an American MQ-9 Reaper drone over Yemeni airspace in Hodeida governate, in what they said was the 15th downing of enemy aircraft since Hamas\u2019s October 2023 attack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA U.S. defense official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said the U.S. military had lost contact with an MQ-9 over the Red Sea on Monday. \u201cWe are actively assessing the incident to determine the cause and follow-on actions,\u201d the official said.\n\nFormer officials said the Biden administration developed a proposal that would have re-designated the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization late last year, but officials ultimately decided to leave that decision to the incoming Trump administration.\n\nU.S. officials have said that while Iran has provided significant support to the Houthis, they see the group as an independent actor that might not necessarily respond to Tehran\u2019s instructions to stand down its maritime attacks. The Houthis have also established their own substantial, independent weapons production capability.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMohammed Al-Basha, a Yemen analyst, said the designation may result in additional U.S. steps to isolate the Houthis financially and logistically, such as cutting off the access of Yemeni banks from the global banking system. But he also noted that the group could attempt to evade the measures by working with Russia or other actors to obtain fuel or other imports.\n\nThe Houthis have largely halted their attacks on commercial and naval vessels following Israel\u2019s ceasefire with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Al-Basha said, but Houthi officials have warned they will resume drone and missile strikes should the deal break down.\n\nAid groups have warned about the humanitarian impact of a re-designation. In a January statement following the Trump administration\u2019s announcement that it intended to target the Houthis, Oxfam America said that Trump\u2019s previous designation had damaging impacts on imports and commerce even before it took effect.\n\n\u201cWe know that humanitarian exemptions weren\u2019t enough to stop the immediate impacts,\u201d Scott Paul, the group\u2019s peace and security director, said in January. \u201cEven with those caveats, exporters canceled contracts, banks prepared to scale back, and humanitarian organizations began to plan for a dramatic escalation with even fewer resources and more constraints.\u201d",

        "full_text": "The White House provided an answer to a question Tuesday that had been swirling around Elon Musk\u2019s U.S. DOGE Service for days: Who, officially, is in charge?\n\nA White House official said the DOGE administrator is Amy Gleason, a former health-care executive who worked for the agency in a previous iteration. Now Gleason is positioned, at least on paper, to oversee a massive effort to reshape the federal government that has become synonymous with Musk.\n\nThe disclosure comes just days after the director of the White House Office of Administration sparked confusion by declaring in a court filing that Musk, the special government employee whom President Donald Trump said in November would lead the cost-cutting group, has \u201cno actual or formal authority\u201d over government decisions. Moreover, the filing said Musk \u201cis not the U.S. DOGE Service Administrator,\u201d the position outlined in the executive order establishing the U.S. DOGE Service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGleason is former chief product officer at Russell Street Ventures, the firm founded by health-care entrepreneur and DOGE adviser Brad Smith, according to her LinkedIn profile. Before that she worked for the U.S. Digital Service, the U.S. DOGE Service\u2019s predecessor agency, during Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nAt the USDS \u201cshe led the creation of the national covid database and products that used that data to drive the federal response,\u201d an online bio for a speaking opportunity reads.\n\nFriends and former colleagues of Gleason described her as a trained nurse who worked to design electronic medical records, motivated in part by her daughter\u2019s struggle with an autoimmune disease. The Obama administration in 2015 honored those efforts, calling her a \u201cchampion of change.\u201d She later joined the U.S. Digital Service during the Trump administration, where she worked on the nation\u2019s coronavirus response. Smith, the health-care entrepreneur who helped oversee the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to fight the pandemic, then hired Gleason in senior roles at his firms. Smith is now helping oversee DOGE\u2019s operations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAmy is a world-class talent, inspired by her personal journey with the health system to make it better for everyone,\u201d said Aneesh Chopra, who served as the Obama administration\u2019s chief technology officer and has worked with Gleason on several health-care initiatives, such as an effort called \u201cBlue Button\u201d to make Medicare data available to patients.\n\n\u201cIn product terms, she knows how to \u2018ship\u2019 digital services and was quickly tapped to manage the seemingly insurmountable challenge of building a real time map of health capacity during the pandemic,\u201d said Chopra in a written message. \u201cWhatever Amy\u2019s role is at DOGE (USDS), leaders like her should instill greater confidence that the work will benefit the American people. I remain in the camp that more effective and efficient government is \u2014 and should remain \u2014 a bipartisan endeavor.\u201d\n\nGleason has spoken about her family\u2019s challenges of trying to navigate the complexities of the U.S. health system, arguing that the federal government has the power to cut through bureaucracy and red tape. \u201cOne thing that I\u2019ve learned about joining the government is you get to work on really cool problems that affect all of Americans,\u201d Gleason said in a YouTube video posted in 2020, touting her efforts to increase access to Medicare data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed knowing her professionally,\u201d said Laurie Smith, a longtime health-care executive who worked with Gleason years ago on a proposal for a government health-care innovation effort. \u201cShe is action-oriented and practical.\u201d\n\nGleason\u2019s appointment is unlikely to change any perception that Musk is in charge of DOGE, but it answers a key question as to its organizational structure.\n\nStaffers at the U.S. DOGE Service said Gleason addressed them this month, as part of an effort to bring the former U.S. Digital Service staff into the fold at DOGE, though they were unaware of her title at the time.",

        "full_text": "The women behind The Conservateur. \n\nThe Conservateur \u2014 a D.C.-based lifestyle site that positions itself as the Vogue for conservatives \u2014\u00a0is part of a new wave of young women carving out their own lanes in right-wing media.\n\nWhy it matters: The conservative media world has traditionally been dominated by the Roger Aileses and Rush Limbaughs of the world \u2014 or, simply put, older dudes. And now that's changing.\n\nThe big picture: Young people are veering further right, a trend that helped get President Trump back into the Executive Manse and is being fueled in part by Gen Z-coded, conservative-leaning influencers and platforms.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump performed slightly better with women in this election than he did in 2020.\n\nState of play: The Conserveatur gained over 40,000 Instagram followers in the three days following Trump's election, says Jayme Franklin, a and Trump White House alum who co-founded the site and runs it alongside three other women.\n\nThe site bills itself as a lifestyle platform, not a news outlet: Articles include tips on how to decorate for Christmas like a First Lady, a piece on Lara Trump's new fitness line, profiles of White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and host Ainsley Earhardt, and a behind-the-scenes look at Cooper's Nashville wedding.\n\nBy the numbers: The Conservateur saw 1.7 million page views last year, says Franklin, and the women fund it themselves, bringing in revenue from subscriptions and by selling merch.\n\nAnd, of course, there's a little lib-owning: One meme shared on the platform's Instagram shows Barron Trump holding his hand up to his ear with overlaid text reading, \"When I refresh ICE's live deportation tracker.\"\n\nHow it started: Franklin and her co-founder, Isabelle Redfield, launched the Conservateur in 2020 as an antidote to what they saw as the overt wokeism within traditional mags like Marie Claire or Cosmopolitan.\n\nWhat they're saying: After Trump claimed the popular vote last year, it's now no longer \"taboo\" to be considered a conservative, says Downey: \"You couldn't really question the fact that more than half the country is now on board with this, and you can't say they're all crazy.\"\n\nThe intrigue: Franklin tells several things have led to this vibe shift.\n\nFirst, libs lost cachet with former President Biden: \"The left had an opportunity in 2020 to really take advantage of culture, because [there] was a lot of energy there, especially with BLM and all that stuff,\" Franklin tells . \"And then they put in this, to be quite frank, old man who just didn't inspire anyone.\"\n\nSecond, young people started to chafe against \"the progressive culture of policing everything,\" says Franklin. \"You're not allowed to say this, you can't make a joke, you'll be canceled.\"\n\nThird, some women got fed up with feminism. \"Growing up, you were sold this [narrative of] 'men are bad. Don't get married. Be your own woman. Be a career woman,''\" says Franklin.\n\nFourth, many wellness-loving women have found a gateway to the right through the MAHA movement, particularly moms concerned with their kids' food ingredients or vaccines.\n\nBetween the lines: The Conservateur's audience tends to be women ages 20-40 in left-ish metro areas who lean Christian and conservative, Franklin tells . Sororities love them, too.\n\nZoom in: Things are already changing in largely liberal D.C. since Trump came back to town, says Franklin.\n\nWhat we're watching: A Conservateur podcast is in the works, say Downey and Franklin, and they'd love to feature women of the Trump administration who they believe won't get their due in mainstream media: Names floated include Kristi Noem, Pam Bondi and Linda McMahon.\n\nThe bottom line: \"We're a capitalist country at the end of the day, and capitalism caters to consumers,\" says Franklin of the tide shift. \"If Trump's the popular candidate, a lot of these brands are going to have to start catering.\"",

When President [Donald] Trump was saying about 4% support of Zelenskyy, which is not correct at all, based on all information which we currently have, President Zelenskyy has more than 55% support in Ukraine and, in fact, all different parties, despite opposition or coalition, has consensus that during this stage of the war, it's simply impossible to conduct elections in Ukraine,\" he added.\n\n\"I would be happy to see elections in Ukraine as in the Parliament, as presidential elections.

Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., said, because \"Ukraine is still in a precarious position\" before potential talks to end Russia's war on Ukraine.\n\n\"This ultimately, obviously, there needs to be a negotiated settlement,\" Lawler told NPR. \"I think what President Trump is trying to do is get Vladimir Putin to the table for a negotiation.\n\n\"In order to have the strongest possible hand in that negotiation, I think the objective is to have an economic cooperation agreement with Ukraine and the United States, which will strengthen that ability to negotiate.\n\n\"And in order to negotiate a settlement, you need to get both sides to the table. Joe Biden's administration did not engage with Putin for over three years. That obviously complicates the ability to get someone to the table to have an initial discussion.\"\n\nZelenskyy balked at the minerals deal because it did not come with security guarantees, but Lawler noted economic cooperation with Trump's America is de facto security against further Putin aggression.\n\n\"In order for Ukraine to have a very strong hand in the negotiation, the greater the economic cooperation with the U.S. moving forward, the more investment guarantees from the U.S., the easier it will be long term to have security guarantees, and that's important,\" Lawler said.\n\nTrump is playing chess, while Zelenskyy was sticking to his old war-aid talking points he had used during the Biden administration, and Lawler rejected the NPR interviewer's suggestion Trump was scoring an economic prize out of Ukraine.\n\n\"It's not about giving to the U.S.: They're going to need significant economic investment to rebuild when this conflict is over like the rest of Europe during World War II in the aftermath,\" Lawler said.\n\n\"So, having this economic cooperation agreement is critical for the rebuilding efforts moving forward.\n\n\"And by having that level of U.S. investment and engagement, when there is a final agreement, it's going to be a lot harder for Vladimir Putin to renege on it and invade Ukraine again with U.S. investment on the ground.\n\n\"The only winner the other day was Vladimir Putin, that this deal did not happen.\"\n\nBut it just might be the moment that lures Putin to talk a settlement of his war on Ukraine.",

        "full_text": "A federal judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked the U.S. military from enforcing President Donald Trump's executive order barring transgender people from military service while a lawsuit by 20 current and would-be service members challenging the measure goes forward.\n\nU.S. District Judge Ana Reyes in Washington found that Trump's January 27 order, one of a several issued by the Republican president impacting legal rights for transgender Americans, likely violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition on sex discrimination.\n\nReyes was appointed by President Joe Biden, Trump's Democrat predecessor.\n\nIn response to Trump's order, the military said on Feb. 11 that it would no longer allow transgender individuals to join the military and would stop performing or facilitating procedures associated with gender transition for service members. Later that month, the military said it would begin expelling transgender members.\n\nTrump said in his order that \"adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual's sex conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life.\"\n\nTrump issued a similar order during his first term, during which already-serving transgender members were allowed to remain.\n\nPlaintiffs in the lawsuit argued that the order was illegal, pointing to a 2020 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that employment discrimination against transgender people is a form of illegal sex discrimination.\n\nLawyers for the government have argued in court that the military is entitled to bar people with certain conditions that make them unsuitable for service, also including bipolar disorder and eating disorders. At a March 12 hearing, they told Reyes that she should defer to the judgment of the current administration that transgender people are not fit for service.\n\nThe judge repeatedly pressed them to justify their stance with evidence, and at times expressed open outrage at the order's language denigrating the character of transgender people.\n\nThe military has about 1.3 million active-duty personnel, Department of Defense data shows. While transgender rights advocates say there are as many as 15,000 transgender service members, officials say the number is in the low thousands.",

        "full_text": "\u2018He\u2019ll Do the Hard Thing\u2019\n\n\u201cEverybody has that voice in their head,\u201d John Thune once told a reporter from the Rapid City Journal. He was talking about his father. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of that voice inside my head,\u201d he said, \u201cthe one that knows where the lines and the boundaries are.\u201d\n\nHarold Thune was born in Mitchell, South Dakota, on Dec. 28, 1919. The son of an immigrant from Norway \u2014 Nikolai Gjelsvik became Nick Thune when he arrived at Ellis Island in 1906 \u2014 he grew up on the high plains in Murdo, a small, sparse, windswept spot in which earlier settlers had sought shelter in huts made of sod. He was a basketball standout, first leading Murdo to the state championship game, then becoming at the University of Minnesota the most valuable player on the team. At a Minneapolis soda shop he met a Canadian-born clerk who\u2019d lost her railroad-worker father in accident when she was not yet 3. Harold Thune and Yvonne Patricia Bodine got married after he\u2019d enlisted in the Navy after Pearl Harbor, and he was sent to the Pacific after that. He flew more than 60 missions off the USS Intrepid. In his Grumman Hellcat he downed four Japanese Mitsubishi \u201cZeros\u201d and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. \u201cYou always wanted to keep the enemy off your tail,\u201d he once said. The Japanese military\u2019s \u201c\u2018Zero\u2019 was a lighter plane and could outturn the planes that we flew.\u201d One way to win a fight, he learned, was to rely on experience and nerve. Another way, he came to believe, was to try to not have one in the first place.\n\nOn many mornings Thune\u2019s mother sang in the house in her soprano. The sun is a-rising to welcome the day. High-ho! Come to the fair! \u201cShe had a way,\u201d Thune would say, in the Murdo Coyote newspaper, \u201cof making you like the day, whether you wanted to or not.\u201d She had her kids read, even in the summer, an hour every day. She saw to it that they took piano lessons before school. Thune\u2019s father saw to it that they did the lessons right. He sat with them to make sure. His father, Thune once said, didn\u2019t like \u201cball hogs.\u201d He didn\u2019t like people who prized \u201cpersonal glory.\u201d The best members of a team, his father stressed, did what they did for \u201cthe good of the team.\u201d The best members of a team, he believed, made the other members better.\n\nThune as a basketball star missed the last shot he took. It was the end of a one-point loss to the archrival in the championship of the district. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like it was a cupcake shot. It was a long ways away,\u201d Brian O\u2019Reilly, one of his teammates, told me. \u201cEverybody in the gym knew John was going to get the ball, and of course they double- and triple-teamed him, and he tried his best,\u201d Chris Venard, another one of his teammates, told me. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody blamed him,\u201d he said. \u201cHe blamed himself.\u201d He sat alone in the locker room until his coach and his mentor tapped him on the shoulder. \u201cJohn,\u201d Jerry Applebee said, \u201cit\u2019s time to get on the bus.\u201d\n\nThe motto of Jones County High School\u2019s Class of 1979: \u201cToday, we follow; tomorrow, we lead.\u201d\n\n\u201cJohn has always wanted to serve and to do what\u2019s right,\u201d his father once told a reporter. \u201cHe told me if the hard thing is the right thing to do,\u201d he said, \u201che\u2019ll do the hard thing.\u201d\n\n\u2018John\u2019s a Follower\u2019\n\nHe conceded.\n\nThe real beginning of Thune\u2019s long electoral career could have been the end. He was already better than a decade deep in his political life. From the mid-\u201980s to the mid-\u201990s, he\u2019d been an eager aide to Republican Sen. James Abdnor, a special assistant for the U.S. Small Business Administration, the executive director for the South Dakota Republican Party and the South Dakota Municipal League, the state railroad director.\n\nIn 1996, he\u2019d run for Congress and won. \u201cThere\u2019s an old saying that organizational change comes from gentle pressure relentlessly applied,\u201d he told NPR. \u201cYou do things incrementally. And you do it in a fashion that promotes,\u201d he said, \u201ca spirit of cooperation, and that\u2019s really the only way you can get things accomplished.\u201d\n\nAnd in 2002, in his third term in Congress, he\u2019d thought about running for governor, but President George W. Bush helped sell him on a run for the Senate \u2014 a potential pivotal vote in an evenly cleaved chamber. But in the end, he\u2019d lost to Tim Johnson, the incumbent Democrat \u2014 by 524 votes. Some whispered of rumors of fraud on the Native American reservations in the state. Thune spurned calls to challenge the results. He did not, he said, want to put South Dakota \u201cthrough a lengthy recount which would not guarantee my victory or fix any irregularities\u201d and \u201cwould be painful for the state and unlikely to change the outcome.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe competes. I mean, he competes,\u201d Karl Adam, a lobbyist in Pierre who\u2019s a longtime Thune friend, told me. \u201cBut John\u2019s not a disruptor.\u201d\n\nAlso, though, Thune \u201cset himself up\u201d for a run to come, \u2019 Michael Barone said at the time, \u201cby not being a poor loser.\u201d\n\nAnd so two years later, he decided to run again \u2014 this time, though, against Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader who had been the Senate majority leader, the top Democrat in Washington. It was seen as a very tall task, and at stake was his political career \u2014 lose for the Senate for the second time in three years and he was probably done. But it was \u201ca race that needed to be run,\u201d Thune said at the time. \u201cHe just felt,\u201d Dick Wadhams, his campaign manager, told me, \u201cit was the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nBush was running against John Kerry for president, but the New York Times dubbed Thune-Daschle \u201cthe other big race of 2004.\u201d The thrust of Thune\u2019s case: After 26 years in Congress, Daschle had lost touch with South Dakota and become too Washington-enmeshed. \u201cThere is negativity and partisanship going on in Washington, and Daschle has become a symbol of why things don\u2019t get done,\u201d Thune said in a fundraising letter. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be a member of my party,\u201d he said in an ad, pitching himself as a more independent option. \u201cBut \u2026 no party is right all the time.\u201d\n\nDaschle countered by saying Thune had had a chance to oppose Bush a couple years before during a flap about a dearth of federal drought relief for South Dakota. In a debate on \u2019s Meet the Press, host Tim Russert asked Thune why he hadn\u2019t more forcefully called that out. He had, Thune replied, shared his concerns \u2014 in private. Daschle suggested that wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cJohn\u2019s a follower, and I think there\u2019s something to be said for following, but you\u2019ve got to be more than a follower in the United States Senate,\u201d Daschle said.\n\nThune won. He beat Daschle by 4,508 votes \u2014 a little more than a percentage point \u2014 the first time in 52 years a sitting Senate leader had lost. It marked a lasting shift in the political makeup of South Dakota \u2014 a resolutely conservative state that throughout the latter half of the 20th century nonetheless had sent its fair share of Democrats to Congress. Not anymore. \u201cThat was kind of it for the Democrats in South Dakota,\u201d Tony Venhuizen, the current lieutenant governor, told me. Time magazine labeled Thune a \u201cGiant Killer,\u201d and the Sunday after the election, he was on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d as the Republican counterpart to the Democrats\u2019 new leading light \u2014 Senator-elect Barack Obama.\n\nIn Washington, in his first term in the Senate, Thune carried on with an approach he\u2019d established in his six years in the House, according to staffers, allies and watchers of Congress from both parties. He scheduled with fellow members dinners or Bible studies. He had an uncanny capacity to remember names \u2014 aides, colleagues, spouses and kids. He was known as a good boss, conspicuously minimal churn on his staff, people who worked for him often working for him for an unusually long time. He was reliably ready in the halls of the Hill to banter with reporters to make and maintain rapport. He listened more than he spoke. He waited and he watched. Seldom was he a first mover. \u201cHe\u2019s a skilled hunter,\u201d Kyle Downey, his top communications adviser early in his Senate tenure, told me, \u201cso he\u2019d often say, \u2018Let\u2019s just keep our powder dry.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn 2008, he not only endorsed John McCain for president but campaigned for him. There was more than political admiration. There was something of a personal connection. His father had received his Distinguished Flying Cross Award from McCain\u2019s grandfather. And Thune was on the list for the vice-presidential nod \u2014 the one that went instead to Sarah Palin. In 2010, he was reelected without opposition. And he thought hard about running for president heading toward 2012. \u201cIf he wins the nomination, it will be because he is an exceptionally skilled retail politician who can communicate a kind of midwestern, common sense conservatism that is ascendant in reaction to liberal profligacy,\u201d Stephen F. Hayes wrote in The Weekly Standard. Mitch McConnell was a fan. \u201cI think he\u2019s the complete package and is the kind of person who could conceivably go the distance in a race for the presidency,\u201d McConnell, then the Senate minority leader, told Hayes. The GOP field was open. Obama, seeking his second term, seemed vulnerable.\n\n\u2018A Very Challenging Time To Be In Public Life\u2019\n\nAnd then down the escalator came Trump.\n\nThune at first didn\u2019t think much of Trump\u2019s run. He didn\u2019t think it would last. \u201cA short-term phenomenon,\u201d he said that summer of 2015. \u201cHe\u2019s someone who grabs attention,\u201d he said, \u201cbut does he have the potential to go the distance?\u201d\n\nAs Trump, though, started to surge, Thune started to shift \u2014 even if the shift was slight. \u201cThere is no denying that Donald Trump has struck a chord with voters throughout the country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been the summer of Trump for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cBut,\u201d he said, \u201cI think there will be other people who will emerge.\u201d\n\nThey did not. And by December, when Trump floated the notion of banning Muslims from entry into the country, National Journal asked the question: Is there a line Trump can\u2019t cross with Republicans? Thune in effect was inclined to leave it to the voters. Trump\u2019s comments about Muslims were \u201cnot consistent with the values and beliefs that we hold as a nation,\u201d he said. \u201cI think in the end,\u201d he also said, \u201cwe will nominate a candidate that can lead our party in the general election.\u201d\n\nThat, in 2016, is what happened \u2014 just not how Thune thought it would. He didn\u2019t go to the Republican National Convention. He spoke up when Trump attacked Gold Star parents who spoke out against Trump at the Democratic National Convention. \u201cDonald Trump,\u201d Thune said, \u201chas to develop a thicker skin, realize that these campaigns and elections are not about him. It\u2019s about the future of this country.\u201d\n\nAnd in early October, in the wake of the shock of the Access Hollywood tape, Thune was the seniormost Republican to finally in essence answer that National Journal question. Here was the line. Trump, he thought, should leave the race \u2014 \u201cshould withdraw,\u201d Thune said in a tweet, \u201cand Mike Pence should be our nominee effective immediately.\u201d Thune said the recording was \u201cmore offensive than anything I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d But even this answer came with a clause: If, he said, the top-of-the-ticket GOP option remained Trump, Thune would vote for Trump.\n\nSo he did, and so, of course, did nearly 63 million others, and so in 2017 Thune established a certain template to the way he dealt with and talked about Trump. Trump\u2019s baseless insistence that he\u2019d won the popular vote and desire for an investigation into fraud? Thune \u201chad not seen any evidence\u201d of that, but \u201cwe\u2019ve moved on,\u201d he said in January. Trump\u2019s eye-opening and unsubstantiated charge that former President Barack Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower? \u201cBoy, I have no idea,\u201d Thune told in March. Trump\u2019s quest to quash Obamacare? \u201cWe are proceeding according to plan,\u201d Thune said in May. \u201cBut,\u201d he said, \u201cless drama on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue would be a good thing.\u201d And so it went \u2014 Thune backing Trump in his health care-repeal and tax-cut initiatives while lamenting his inveterate feud-picking and wanly wishing he would stop tweeting, eventually settling on a sort of Pavlovian posture that was pragmatic, or acquiescent, or both. The man from Murdo didn\u2019t not push back against the man from Manhattan \u2014 he just didn\u2019t call him out. Thune was no sycophant \u2014 nor, though, was he some stance-taking crusader.\n\nThune\u2019s M.O. was a dependable level of trying to find the thinnest of middle grounds that some found measured and others found milquetoast. It wasn\u2019t always outright equivocation. But it was also never downright condemnation. Once at a concession stand at a basketball game in South Dakota a man told him he wasn\u2019t sufficiently pro-Trump and he turned around and another man said he wasn\u2019t suitably anti-Trump. \u201cI know a lot of people are unhappy with him, and they vent a lot to me on a regular basis, too, but what they have to understand is he was elected by a big majority in South Dakota,\u201d Thune said that summer at the Brown County Fair. \u201cTo me,\u201d he told a reporter from the Aberdeen American News, \u201cit\u2019s about being a realist, and to be a realist about my work. I know what it takes to get things done in Congress, and I know that it takes a president to sign legislation into law, and we\u2019ve got to be able to function together to do that.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t change in 2019, and neither, really, did Thune \u2014 now the GOP whip. \u201cI wish he wouldn\u2019t tweet as much,\u201d he said in January. \u201cThere are concerns, and our members are conveying those,\u201d he said in February. \u201cA bridge too far,\u201d Thune said in March of Trump\u2019s proposal to declare a national emergency to get money to build more border wall. He tried to get Trump to back off of tariffs. He expressed disapproval of Trump\u2019s conduct that led to his first impeachment but also the Democrat-led impeachment itself. He voted to acquit. \u201cThere is a real concern out there that the behavior of the president \u2026 obviously isn\u2019t what some of our members would condone, but at the same time it didn\u2019t reach that threshold that would allow him to be removed from office,\u201d he said on the PBS NewsHour. But was what the president did, he was asked, wrong? \u201cAt this point,\u201d Thune said, \u201cit\u2019s kind of a discussion that is past us.\u201d\n\nAnd as the first Trump administration careened toward its chaotic conclusion \u2014 the pandemic, the murder of George Floyd and the fallout, the president\u2019s increasingly manic comportment \u2014 Thune urged him to listen to health professionals and to strike a tone that was more \u201ccalm,\u201d more \u201creassuring,\u201d more \u201cempathetic.\u201d When Trump wouldn\u2019t commit to a peaceful transition of power? Thune said that couldn\u2019t happen. \u201cRepublicans believe in the rule of law,\u201d he said in September. \u201cWe believe in the Constitution.\u201d And in November, after Trump lost, Thune balked at helping him challenge the certification of his defeat. \u201cIt\u2019s just not going anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, in the Senate, it would go down like a shot dog.\u201d Trump responded on Twitter as if Thune were a declared enemy: \u201cHe will be primaried in 2022, political career over!!!\u201d Trump said \u2014 at which point Thune shifted some. \u201cWe are letting people vote their conscience,\u201d he told reporters at the Capitol. \u201cThis is an issue that\u2019s incredibly consequential, incredibly rare historically and very precedent-setting,\u201d he said. But then Jan. 6, 2021, happened. It seemed for a moment that Trump indeed was done and done for good, and Thune, in turn, seemed to rediscover his resolve.\n\n\u201cToday,\u201d Thune said on Jan. 6, \u201chas been a sad day for America. The violent behavior at the Capitol is inexcusable and disgusting, but we won\u2019t be deterred from our Constitutional duty. We need to work together to protect our democracy. Please pray for our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur identity for the past several years now has been built around an individual. You got to get back to where it\u2019s built around a set of ideals and principles and policies,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people \u2014 including the president and others around him and other voices and in media circles and social-media platforms \u2014 have been putting out false facts and then getting people to believe those things now for weeks,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s just time for it to stop.\u201d\n\nAnd yet in the subsequent and second impeachment Thune voted again to acquit. \u201cWhat former President Trump did to undermine faith in our election system and disrupt the peaceful transfer of power is inexcusable,\u201d he said. But impeachment, Thune explained, was meant for removal from office, and Trump was already out of office, and impeaching him after his ouster, he argued, would take the power out of the hands of the voters.\n\nIt had been a long four years. \u201cThere was just kind of a shift in 2016 where everything just kind of changed,\u201d a former Thune staffer told me. \u201cJust all the things \u2026 got harder.\u201d Thune thought hard about not running for reelection in 2022. One reason was the chance to spend more time with his wife, his daughters and his grandkids \u2014 but another was Trump, the durability of his political viability, the looming possibility or even probability of his return.\n\nHe made his choice. He ran again.\n\n\u201cHe saw,\u201d Mike Rounds, his fellow senator from South Dakota, told me, \u201cthere was a possibility of becoming the leader \u2026\u201d\n\nHow long had Thune wanted to be leader?\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d Rounds said, \u201che\u2019s wanted to be a leader since he got here.\u201d\n\nBut he wanted to be the Senate majority leader working with a Republican president who wasn\u2019t Donald Trump. In the 2024 primary \u2014 after Rounds did the same \u2014 Thune endorsed Tim Scott.\n\nBut Trump won the South Carolina primary on Feb. 24 and with it for all intents and purposes the GOP nomination. Thune called him that night. He endorsed him the next day. And he announced his candidacy for leader a week later. He made a trip to Mar-a-Lago shortly thereafter. He said he\u2019d worked with him before. He said he could work with him again.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re more animated these days by the personality of Donald Trump, and that\u2019s the reality we live with and deal with if you want to be involved in public life,\u201d Thune said after he announced his bid to succeed McConnell. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of where our voters are,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you have to listen to your voters.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod wants us to be out there being salt and light in the culture,\u201d he said when he won. \u201cI want to be a hopeful, optimistic leader,\u201d he said, \u201ca leader who\u2019s willing to do hard things, make hard decisions.\u201d\n\n\u2018My Guess Is That He\u2019s at Least Somewhat Tortured\u2019\n\nThe fire in the fireplace in the office of the leader on the Senate side of the Capitol was smoking. The eyes of the wall-mounted head of a bison named Murdo were watching. The other day, toward the tail end of 10 straight weeks of the Senate in session, going on two months into the second Trump term and with the specter of a government shutdown in the air, the trim Thune wore a blue suit and sat down to talk.\n\nI asked him about that voice in his head of his dad. The one that knows where the lines and the boundaries are. \u201cPeople I\u2019ve talked to, Democrats, too, admire you for knowing where the line is,\u201d I said. \u201cWhere in this moment,\u201d I asked, \u201cis that line?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI mean, I think that you have to pick and choose your battles. And obviously right now I think this is an adjustment phase that we\u2019re in. We\u2019ve got an administration that\u2019s incredibly aggressive, that\u2019s moving quickly and decisively, and to the Democrats\u2019 displeasure \u2014 in their view, too quickly, too decisively \u2014 but I think at the end of the day it\u2019s defending the prerogatives of the institution. I mean, I think the Senate, as an institution and the Article I branch of the government, constitutionally has a role to play, and I think it\u2019s important that the leader understand and be willing to defend the institution and preserve its unique role in our democracy \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIn what ways in the last two months,\u201d I said, \u201chave you as leader defended the prerogatives of the institution?\u201d\n\n\u201cA willingness to adhere to the rules. Everything we\u2019ve done so far with regard to nominees, notwithstanding a lot of pressure to break the rules and do things differently and all kind of recess appointments \u2014 there are lots of ideas being thrown around out there \u2014 we\u2019ve done it the old-fashioned way, and we have just ground things out, pounded away at getting the job done. And I think there\u2019s always a lot of pressure from \u2014 and there was in the first time around, in the first Trump term, to get rid of the filibuster \u2014 and we resist that because we understand the unique role that the founders had for the Senate,\u201d Thune said. \u201cThere are constantly threats to and efforts to undermine the Senate\u2019s role.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you,\u201d I said, \u201csaid to the president at any point, That\u2019s our job, not yours?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve said it exactly that way,\u201d Thune said with a laugh. \u201cIt might\u2019ve been a little bit more diplomatic \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve said a version of that, privately, diplomatically?\u201d\n\n\u201cOr when asked by people \u2014 whether it\u2019s the president or people around him or people who share some of his views on how we should do things around here \u2014 I think,\u201d Thune said, \u201cI\u2019ve been very clear.\u201d\n\nPeople who know him well these days sometimes watch him and worry about the toll this job is taking. The people who raised him are gone. His mother and Abdnor died in 2012. His father died, at 100 years old, in 2020. Coach Jerry Applebee died just this January. Now his older brother. \u201cMy prayer for him,\u201d his younger brother Tim told me, \u201cis don\u2019t let Washington corrupt you. You\u2019re John Thune. You\u2019re the kid from Murdo. Stay the kid from Murdo. Don\u2019t let Washington corrupt you.\u201d\n\nHe has to this point as leader of the Senate in this country\u2019s 119th Congress compiled a record of what some see as accomplishment and what others consider accommodation. He toasted Trump at his inauguration. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking backwards, we\u2019re looking forward,\u201d he said of the Jan. 6 pardons. \u201cThis is not unusual for an administration to pause funding,\u201d he said of the aid freeze. \u201cThe president is somebody who sees great value in the use of tariffs as a tool, and we\u2019ll have, I\u2019m sure, lots of conversations,\u201d Thune said of Trump\u2019s tariffs that could have massive consequences for among many others his own farming constituents in South Dakota. He\u2019s \u201cput some ideas out there,\u201d he said of Trump\u2019s musing about taking over Gaza and making it a seaside resort. \u201cAnything that DOGE does will be factored into what we do here,\u201d he said of the activities of Elon Musk. \u201cThe American people handed him a decisive mandate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important we honor that mandate by confirming his nominees as quickly as possible,\u201d he said. He\u2019s praised Trump\u2019s picks for his Cabinet. \u201cWe\u2019re trending in the right direction,\u201d he said. And in the aftermath of the Oval Office blowup between Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, even as some fellow Senate Republicans reacted with great consternation \u2014 \u201cI am sick to my stomach as the administration appears to be walking away from our allies and embracing Putin, a threat to democracy and U.S. values,\u201d said Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski \u2014 Thune did what he does. \u201cNo question in my mind that Russia is the aggressor,\u201d he told South Dakota\u2019s Mitchell Republic. But he didn\u2019t clearly criticize the interaction or Trump\u2019s part, calling the meeting \u201cspirited\u201d and pointing to the future. \u201cObviously,\u201d he said, \u201cthere will have to be some subsequent follow-up meetings that occur, but hopefully they got some of that out of their system \u2026\u201d Thune aides say his relationship with Trump has never been better.\n\n\u201cTalk about the right person being in the right place at the right time,\u201d Scott Howell, the longtime Thune consultant, told me. \u201cThe years of his service have culminated in this moment,\u201d Steve Daines, the Montana senator and Thune confidant, told me. \u201cHe\u2019s smart enough,\u201d Larry Rhoden, the South Dakota governor, told me, \u201cto get behind Trump, lock, stock and barrel,\u201d\n\nBut Thune\u2019s role, which is to say the role of the Senate, is not exclusively or even primarily to work with the president and enact the agenda of the executive, according to his critics. The Senate, in the words of James Madison, is supposed to \u201cprotect the people against the transient impressions in which they themselves might be led.\u201d The Senate, in the words of Mike Mansfield, history\u2019s longest-serving Senate majority leader, is \u201cone of the foundations of the Constitution\u201d \u2014 \u201cone of the rocks of the Republic.\u201d\n\nAnd the current majority leader? \u201cYou are in an extraordinary position now to curb this presidency and keep it in bounds,\u201d Ken Kemp said this month in his latest open letter to Thune. \u201cI was trying to appeal to the better angels of his nature, because they\u2019re there,\u201d Kemp told me. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting to see you take your stand,\u201d Kemp wrote. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting and hoping.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe next year or two will tell a lot about what matters to him and how much it matters,\u201d longtime Tom Daschle adviser Pete Stavrianos told me. \u201cOn one side you have his ambition, and on the other side you have what he believes in about our system, and democracy and the prerogatives of the Senate,\u201d he said. \u201cMy guess he\u2019s at least somewhat tortured on the inside.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an overstatement, it really isn\u2019t, to say the fate of our democracy and our country may be determined by a single decision that he makes,\u201d Drey Samuelson, the former Tim Johnson chief of staff, told me.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a damn shame,\u201d Mark Salter, the longtime John McCain adviser, told me. \u201cGod,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not worth it. Your time is so finite. It\u2019s so brief. Your life is brief. But your time in public life is briefer. And when you\u2019re gone,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re gone.\u201d\n\nThis week in his office Thune brought up David Brooks without me having to ask. \u201cDavid Brooks talks about resume virtues and eulogy virtues,\u201d he told me. \u201cI went to my brother\u2019s funeral in California here not long ago,\u201d he said. \u201cI was reminded of the importance of eulogy virtues.\u201d\n\nIn what ways, I wondered, is what he\u2019s doing right now and how he\u2019s doing it \u201cresume\u201d work, and in what ways is it \u201ceulogy\u201d work?\n\n\u201cI think sometimes what you do might be considered resume work,\u201d he said. \u201cI think how you do it is considered more eulogy work.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou listened to what people said about your brother,\u201d I said to Thune. \u201cWhat do you think people will say about you at your service?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cthat chapter\u2019s probably still being written.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you think they will say about this particular moment in time, this role that you\u2019re playing right now?\u201d",

        "full_text": "Newsom is hardly the first politician to have his own podcast platform. But in an interview with Tuesday, he pointed to aspects he believes differentiate it from the typical gabfest: He\u2019s an officeholder booking guests he vehemently disagrees with \u2014 occasionally to spar, but with the goal of building out a forum that illuminates their respective positions.\n\n\u201cWe already know what our disagreements are with the MAGA movement. I want to understand what the motivations are, the legitimacy of those motivations, and just really understand where people are coming from,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cThey are influential \u2014 they are. They explain more things in more ways on more days about what\u2019s going on and if we\u2019re not trying to understand their motivations, we will be victims of their motivations.\u201d\n\nNewsom, a student of the right-wing ecosystem who is both fascinated and distressed by its ability to elevate subjects into the mainstream, mentioned his regular appearances on , Newsmax and other conservative outlets. He debated Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in late 2023, moderated by Fox\u2019s Sean Hannity, who remains in regular touch with Newsom. He ran a series of TV ads in red states over the last two years calling attention to their anti-abortion laws.\n\nBut his show, premiering in the coming weeks, won\u2019t be confined to crashing the ascendent right-wing.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, I want Democrats to come on and sort of challenge where we are on a lot of these issues,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cAnd so I\u2019m asking the same questions you\u2019re asking of me: Where the hell is the Democratic Party? What are we doing? Who are we? Where are we going? What\u2019s the path back? I\u2019m having the exact same conversations, and I just thought it\u2019d be a hell of a lot more interesting to do it publicly and to do it as honestly as I can.\u201d\n\nReferring to his podcast host persona as \u201cpractitioner, not pundit,\u201d Newsom said he wants to give conversations from the show immediate relevance by taking some from concept to action, including new policy approaches and ways he can try to better connect with Californians.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to stress test positions, including my own, in a more transparent manner,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not a place everyone comes for therapy. I\u2019m not looking to just give the orthodoxy \u2014 progressive and liberal talking points. There are so many outstanding people doing that, like our gifted professionals. I add no value in that space. I\u2019m a redundant voice \u2026 But what I think I can offer is as a practitioner \u2014 not an ideologue, not a pundit: I\u2019m in it as much or more than most elected officials in this country, because I\u2019m in the largest state. I\u2019m in a state that\u2019s deeply on the mind of the administration. I\u2019m in a state that is profoundly critical to the fate and future as it relates to some of the most critical industries like artificial intelligence, and obviously in this remarkable moment as it relates to geopolitical re-calibration.\u201d\n\nNewsom has largely resisted offering a fulsome postmortem after his party\u2019s miserable 2024 election, though he said the notebook he\u2019s jotted ideas in has grown from eight handwritten pages to 28 as more numerical and anecdotal data emerges. His approach on the podcast recalls the Newsom of early 2022, who grew increasingly exasperated about the lack of aggressiveness to confront resurgent Republicans in the national culture wars. Ultimately, he rallied behind the party\u2019s leaders and became a top surrogate for former President Joe Biden.\n\nNewsom said his goal isn\u2019t to circumvent the news media but to take advantage of his position and deep contact list \u201cto engage, promote and explore dialogue.\u201d He counts comedian Bill Maher\u2019s HBO program and podcast as creative inspiration for his new program, contending the host finds common ground with adversaries while taking frequent aim at Democratic dogma.\n\n\u201cI watch him because I appreciate how he calls balls and strikes \u2014 takes shots at both parties,\u201d said Newsom, a regular guest of Maher\u2019s \u201cReal Time.\u201d \u201cHe has a broader value set that is more aligned with mine, but he doesn\u2019t have a problem in suffering fools on either side of the aisle.\u201d\n\nSam Griffel, who has worked closely with Newsom as a producer on the iHeart podcasts, said his latest effort has an underlying imperative: make sure it\u2019s digestible and authentic, not inaccessible and canned.\n\n\u201cWe as a society are good at sniffing out that type of BS,\u201d he said. \u201cSo for me, the more we\u2019re willing to be pushing into areas of discomfort for our guests and hosts the more real it will be.\u201d\n\nAsked if guests \u2014 particularly Democrats who see the world similarly to him \u2014 will be as candid on the podcast as they are in private texts and calls with him, Newsom conceded, \u201cthat ultimately will be determinative if this is interesting or not.\u201d\n\nNewsom declined to name the half-dozen guests he said have privately agreed to come on with him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose these folks by letting their names out there,\u201d he said. But he gave a big hint: \u201dLook at the lineup at CPAC.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that crew. These are the guys right now who are enjoying their status, they\u2019re enjoying their moment, and they\u2019re having not just a moment here, but around the world. And we want to explore that,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Conservative Political Action Conference\u2019s recent straw poll identified Newsom and Sen. Adam Schiff as the two Democrats who pose the greatest threat to the U.S. and the GOP.\n\nNewsom is no stranger to his own broadcasts. As lieutenant governor, he hosted the weekly \u201cGavin Newsom Show,\u201d which briefly ran on San Francisco-based Current TV and featured interviews with guests from Hollywood and Silicon Valley including the then lesser-known tech entrepreneur Elon Musk. A literary memoir he wrote was scheduled for release on May 13, but has been delayed until at least the fall.\n\nNewsom starts his new venture at the top of a crowded two years in his final term. He\u2019s facing state budget pressures, a hostile federal government and an immense rebuilding effort after the most expensive disaster in U.S. history.\n\nWhile he didn\u2019t spend time focusing his remarks about the new podcast on specific challenges he faces in his last months in office, it will broaden his platform to push back on misinformation he encountered during the wildfires that tore through Los Angeles last month.\n\nThe governor, a natural political pugilist, has largely been reluctant of late to take shots at Trump as he works to appeal to the president for federal disaster aid. Newsom believes that Democrats like himself can have more of an impact by zeroing in on key actions he finds especially detestable like deep cuts to Medicaid.\n\n\u201cThose become the dominant moments, from my perspective, where we need to align and be more aggressive,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are pushing back. Republicans are now starting to wake up. I think we\u2019ve moved from resignation to now more and more resistance. I think that\u2019s very positive. The question then becomes, how do you strategically do that?\u201d\n\nHis word of the year to describe the Trump administration, as he put it, is \u201cbetrayal.\u201d\n\n\u201cFire and fury. What does it signify? Something or nothing?\u201d Newsom asked about the early actions from Washington, allowing that the Musk-led government cuts have added to peoples\u2019 anxiety. \u201cIf it signifies something, you got to call that out. And that\u2019s the \u2018betrayal.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut equally on his radar is Democrats not being overly reactive and instead taking matters into their own hands.\n\n\u201cHow do we break through? Are we just reacting to noise with more noise? Are we more strategic this time, and are we going to pierce the consciousness, not just of our base, they\u2019re already with us, but those that we need to bring back?\u201d he asked, describing those and the other questions he posed in the interview as central themes of the podcast project.\n\nDespite constant criticism from the right, Newsom said he\u2019s not overly worried about giving certain MAGA personalities a platform, though when asked about the conspiracist Alex Jones, he said some characters were likely a bridge too far.\n\nInstead, if anything, he said Democrats have avoided or outright ignored the right at their own peril, and praised former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg\u2019s \u201cgo-everywhere, talk-to-everyone\u201d strategy that calls for calmly confronting opponents on their own turf.\n\n\u201cI think the biggest mistake we\u2019ve made is staying in the warm embrace of our ideological lane. And it didn\u2019t work out for us. We are sitting here on the sidelines right now trying to figure out how to get back in the game,\u201d Newsom said.",

        "full_text": "Fulfillment of these lofty ambitions obliged America to support democracies and oppose dictatorships. As a global superpower with responsibilities no other nation was either able \u2014 or willing \u2014 to undertake, it could not afford to have the impeccably moral foreign policy of Sweden. Idealism inevitably clashed with realism, with the latter often triumphing over the former. This was especially true during the Cold War, when Washington helped engineer the overthrow of democratically elected leaders and supported authoritarian regimes. And it continues today with American backing of repressive governments in the Middle East. But even while employing immoral means, American leaders did so in the pursuit of what they considered moral ends, whether fighting communism, halting the spread of weapons of mass destruction, or resisting radical Islam.\n\nOpponents of the American-led liberal international order harp endlessly upon its faults while taking its virtues \u2014 free and open sea lanes, the spread of liberal democracy, values-based alliances, the protection of human rights \u2014 for granted. Eager to lambaste the order for its many faults, they prefer not to grapple with the international system rapidly taking its place, a dog-eats-dog world where America has abdicated its role as global policeman and authoritarian states gain spheres of influence in which less powerful countries must bend to their will. Even the most vociferous critics of American global power may come to miss it once Russia, China and Iran gain dominance over Europe, Asia and the Middle East.\n\nThe centurieslong record of at least rhetorical support for right over wrong is what made last month\u2019s Oval Office meeting so unsettling. In a display that ought to shame every American, the country\u2019s top two constitutional officers acted like a king and his regent, demanding obeisance from a feudal supplicant. Within days, Trump suspended military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, and while both were later restored, the message he sent was unmistakable: Not even an ally under military attack can depend upon Washington for support. Having abandoned Ukraine out of personal pique, Trump then returned to taking on the world\u2019s other villains: Canada, Denmark and Panama.\n\nIn addition to abandoning our democratic allies abroad, Trump is gutting America\u2019s democracy-promotion apparatus at home. During the Cold War, Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (the latter my former employer) broadcasted news and information beyond the Iron Curtain and continue this mission in regions of the world that remain unfree. (Many nations once subject to Soviet domination \u2014 including Poland, Czechia and the Baltic states \u2014 can credit VOA and RFE/RL, at least in part, for their freedom). The United States Agency for International Development was founded during the administration of Kennedy to alleviate the social and economic conditions in which authoritarianism and terrorism thrive. And the National Endowment for Democracy, created under Reagan, provides grants to democratic activists around the globe. Trump has halted funding for all of these organizations, which represent the best of American values, to cheers from Moscow, Beijing and Tehran.\n\nIn place of the idealism that animated American leadership of the Free World, Trump has unleashed the atavistic cynicism of the Old World. In this new dispensation where might makes right, any appeal to moral considerations in the practice of American foreign policy is ridiculed as a deficiency of the weak while the amoral exercise of power is venerated as a virtue of the strong. Instinctive American sympathy for the underdog is supplanted by admiration for the strongman. An embattled democracy is accused of provoking the invasion of its own territory \u2014 the geopolitical equivalent of blaming a rape victim for her own assault \u2014 and for the first time in history America votes with the world\u2019s rogues against its traditional democratic allies at the United Nations. The occupant of the office once synonymous with \u201cleader of the Free World\u201d slanders the president of a country fighting for its very existence as a \u201cdictator\u201d while lauding a despotic war criminal as \u201ca great guy\u201d and a \u201cterrific person.\u201d At least when Franklin Roosevelt (allegedly) said that Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza \u201cmay be a son of a bitch, but he\u2019s our son of a bitch,\u201d he had the moral clarity to identify the caudillo for what he was, and the tact to do so behind closed doors.\n\nWhile Trump borrows from the Andrew Jackson school of American foreign policy, notable for its strident nationalism and distrust of international institutions, the historical figure whose ideas (and slogans) he leans most heavily on is Pat Buchanan. Once a marginal figure on the American right, the former Nixon speechwriter and Republican presidential candidate stood for the same \u201cAmerica First\u201d trifecta \u2014 anti-immigration, anti-intervention and protectionism \u2014 as Trump does today. In the brave new world of America First, no longer does America stand for the belief that democracies make better allies than dictatorships, that territorial aggression should be punished rather than rewarded, and that alliances are an asset, not a burden. In his Munich speech, Vance endorsed the inclusion of far-right parties in European governments, which he accused of posing a greater threat to their own people than either Russia or China. All of this is the result of a foreign policy utterly lacking in moral scruples.\n\nThe abandonment of morality as a factor in foreign affairs also marks a turning point for the Republican Party. Next month marks the 50th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War. American conservatives once pointed to that event \u2014 the chaotic scenes of desperate Vietnamese fleeing the approaching communist onslaught, the 2 million boat people who managed to escape, the horrific repression that followed for those who did not \u2014 as a shameful example of what happens when the U.S. abandons an ally. Whatever the merits of American involvement in that conflict, the dire consequences of the American withdrawal reverberated across the region. Within months, Laos and Cambodia fell to communist insurgencies, vindicating the much derided \u201cdomino theory.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s abandonment of Ukraine has the potential to dwarf these events in geopolitical magnitude and human suffering. If Ukraine is made to sign a peace deal that doesn\u2019t provide clear-cut security guarantees it will only be a matter of time before Russian President Vladimir Putin attempts another Anschluss. Absent American leadership of the Free World, such an incursion could succeed in toppling the Kyiv government, leading to tens of millions of refugees and a massive Russian military presence on the border of several NATO member states. With the alliance\u2019s guarantee of collective security in tatters thanks to Trump\u2019s extortionist threats not to uphold it, NATO \u2014 the most successful military alliance in history \u2014 will for all intents and purposes be dead, opening the door for further Russian predation in Europe and elsewhere.\n\nLooking for silver linings, some nostalgic for the recently departed era of American global leadership cling to the hope that everything will return to normal once a Democrat or traditional Republican moves into the Oval Office. While the fight over the future of conservative foreign policy is ongoing, there is no turning back. No longer confident of their place under the American security umbrella, alarmed allies like Poland and South Korea are exploring the possibility of acquiring nuclear weapons. The once-ridiculed French idea of \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d \u2014 a pole of European military power independent of the United States \u2014 is now the top agenda item across the continent. The \u201cFive Eyes\u201d intelligence-sharing alliance composed of the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand may shrink to \u201cFour Eyes\u201d due to the unreliability of its most powerful member.\n\nWhat transpired during the last two weeks of February cannot be undone in the minds of America\u2019s allies or its adversaries. And in a world where every man is for himself, what\u2019s the difference between the two?",

        "full_text": "Yet nearly every key decision remains unsettled. They include how deep to cut into social safety-net spending, how to placate swing-seat lawmakers over a key tax break, how to account for the cost of extending existing tax cuts and how many more breaks they can pile on top.\n\n\u201cHow can we be moving quickly when some of those foundational questions haven\u2019t been settled?\u201d North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis said about the rising pressure from the House GOP.\n\nTo help break the deadlock, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and top Trump economic adviser Kevin Hassett are set to huddle again Tuesday with GOP leaders and tax writers as they try to reconcile the two chambers\u2019 diverging plans. On several fronts, the Senate is looking for cues on how to proceed from the House and vice versa, creating a chicken-and-egg situation that has resulted in a quiet standoff between the two chambers.\n\nUnderscoring the firm views on either side, Johnson and other top House GOP leaders issued a joint statement Monday calling on the Senate to \u201ctake up the House budget resolution\u201d upon their return to the Capitol. \u201cThe American people gave us a mandate and we must act on it,\u201d they said.\n\nThat has many Republicans viewing Johnson\u2019s budget goal \u2014 already a retreat from his prior ambition of getting a final bill through the House before Easter \u2014 as deeply aspirational. Senate Republicans want to have something to show for all their private deliberations before they leave again in April. Though their leadership has been careful not to offer any public deadlines, a person granted anonymity to discuss internal deliberations said the goal is to adopt a modified budget resolution before the Senate leaves again in three weeks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to have done it yesterday, but really I just don\u2019t find it helpful to set timelines,\u201d said Senate Finance Chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), who is tasked with negotiating the tax portion of the package.\n\nDriving the caution on the Senate side is widespread skepticism among GOP senators that the House can deliver on a bill that meets the budget it adopted last month \u2014 particularly its goal of $2 trillion in spending cuts. While House Republicans are prodding their Senate counterparts to just adopt what they sent over, senators have made clear they will make changes.\n\nThey are also wary of going through another marathon voting slog \u2014 especially on a framework that will likely require politically perilous Medicaid cuts \u2014 without proof that it can result in a passable bill, according to three Republicans involved in the talks who were granted anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\n\nBut there\u2019s a Catch-22: House Republicans, including Johnson\u2019s tax writers on the Ways and Means Committee, don\u2019t intend to draft a bill before the Senate agrees on a fiscal outline.\n\n\u201cHow can we do that without knowing the Senate number?\u201d said one House GOP lawmaker granted anonymity to speak candidly.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how this works,\u201d a senior House GOP aide concurred.\n\nMeanwhile, the two top leaders are working through unique headaches. Johnson is facing off with conservative hard-liners who not only want the Senate to swallow the House budget whole but are now pushing for a doomed and messy impeachment fight with judges who have ruled against Trump.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, meanwhile, needs to hammer out complex tax disputes among his own members. Republicans are checking in with the nonpartisan parliamentarian \u2014 the Capitol Hill official who referees budget policy \u2014 on whether they can use a controversial accounting tactic that would allow them to effectively zero out the roughly $4 trillion cost of extending Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts. That\u2019s not to mention the widespread heartburn Thune is dealing with inside his conference over the impact of potential Medicaid cuts.\n\nThune and Johnson are in frequent contact, with Johnson publicly floating holding a \u201clittle conference\u201d to hammer out the differences between the two chambers. Thune is meeting with small groups of senators to take their temperature, including with members of the tax-writing Finance Committee.\n\nBut frustrations are rising amid what\u2019s likely to be several more months of complex tax discussions.\n\n\u201cTalk, talk, talk, talk,\u201d Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said upon returning to the Capitol from a March 13 White House meeting with Trump and Senate Finance Republicans. \u201cJust like the last 10 weeks.\u201d\n\nWhile many Republicans insist they will eventually get on the same page, there\u2019s no clear plan for how or when that will happen \u2014 and plenty of finger-pointing over who is ultimately responsible for doing so.\n\nAdding to the complications is the fact that many rank-and-file House Republicans want senators to rein in their own chamber\u2019s budget plan, despite the calls from their leadership for the Senate to do the opposite.\n\nVulnerable House members said they received assurances from GOP leaders that the level of Medicaid cuts required under the House budget framework wouldn\u2019t make it through the Senate. They made similar assurances regarding the $230 billion in potential cuts to the country\u2019s largest anti-hunger program.\n\nHouse Energy and Commerce Chair Brett Guthrie, whose panel has been tasked with making $880 billion of cuts, said he\u2019s waiting to see what the Senate will do before proposing specific changes to Medicaid or other programs under his jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cWe have to have instructions before we can do anything,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just the system.\u201d\n\nTrump green-lit changes to Medicaid during a meeting with Senate Finance Committee members earlier this month, including mandating work requirements and going after \u201cwaste,\u201d according to Republican senators who attended the meeting. But any perceived cuts to benefits stands to spark backlash inside the GOP, and the size of the Energy and Commerce instruction \u2014 calibrated to placate House hard-liners \u2014 has many doubting those cuts are avoidable.\n\nOn the revenue side, many House tax writers privately acknowledge they need the Senate to modify the House budget blueprint to allow for more priorities that the president continues to push, including income tax exemptions for tips, overtime and Social Security benefits.\n\nGOP members of the House Ways and Means Committee met for two days of meetings to discuss those and a slew of other potential tax provisions before leaving for recess. The group worked through various proposals, using red, yellow and green cards to express their opinions on each one, according to three people granted anonymity to discuss the private meetings.\n\nAmong the longest-running and thorniest issues yet to be resolved: how to placate key blue-state Republicans who want an expansion of the income tax deduction for state and local taxes.\n\nThe array of unsettled disputes has contributed to a sense of bemused frustration among many lawmakers, many of whom are waiting on their leaders \u2014 and Trump \u2014 to get more aggressive about resolving them.\n\n\u201cProbably what we are going to do is talk each other to death, stare at each other and then eventually, you know, confuse the issue so much that it takes two months to unravel what we agree to,\u201d said GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky.",

        "full_text": "Given the many global challenges it is tackling, \u201cnobody wants the State Department to be in a position where USAID was, where it had difficulty operating,\u201d the official insisted. (I granted the official and others interviewed anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue.)\n\nFor Rubio, though, the fight over the future structure of the State Department isn\u2019t just about protecting America\u2019s ability to engage in diplomacy. It\u2019s about protecting what power he has in the Trump administration.\n\nThis is, after all, a team of many rivals. Rubio is the chief U.S. diplomat, but an array of other Trump appointees are competing to shape the administration\u2019s foreign policy, from Musk to multiple special envoys. As Musk eyes his department, Rubio has realized he needs to both draw lines and walk some very fine ones.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that Rubio\u2019s past foreign policy views have frequently clashed with Trump\u2019s vision. It means Rubio is now taking stances at odds with his reputation, such as slamming the foreign minister of Poland this week.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s in this awkward situation,\u201d said Gerald Feierstein, a former career diplomat who served as U.S. ambassador to Yemen. \u201cHe\u2019s doing things that he fundamentally believes are bad policy and bad steps. He\u2019s got to go along with it because Musk and Trump are standing between him and his higher ambition of being president.\u201d\n\nI did not expect to write this often about Rubio (this is my third column on him in two months), and he is far from the only Cabinet member dealing with blowback from moves made by Musk and his aides. But Rubio is drawing unusual interest because USAID\u2019s brutal takedown was so early in Trump\u2019s term, because of the national security implications of slashing the State Department and because he\u2019s already seen as one of the weaker Trump appointees.\n\nTo remedy the last perception, Rubio has taken advantage of what the secretary of State\u2019s perch offers \u2014 not the least of which is access to a ready press pool \u2014 to show he can score wins for Trump.\n\nHe\u2019s deeply involved in talks about ending Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine; he has pushed, with some success, Panama to distance itself from China amid Trump\u2019s threats of a Panama Canal takeover; and he has helped enforce Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown. Already, he\u2019s spent a significant amount of time on the road, carrying the Trump banner everywhere from the Munich Security Conference to Israel.\n\nAt times, Rubio has seemed out of place.\n\nHis couch-sinking silence as Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy helped inspire a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d parody. Still, Rubio has tried to dispel suspicions that he disagrees with Trump, going on television repeatedly to defend positions he would never have taken when he was a senator.\n\nRubio has even publicly supported dismantling USAID. But he didn\u2019t have much say in it. By the time Rubio was named USAID\u2019s acting administrator, Musk, DOGE and Trump political appointee Pete Marocco had largely unraveled the institution.\n\nIt was Rubio, though, who took much of the resulting heat from Capitol Hill, the courts and his own workforce, even as he never gained control of the USAID situation. (He did, however, protect some programs, saving about 400 that DOGE wanted to cut.)\n\nThe State Department is different \u2014 and Rubio is less willing to sacrifice it the way he did USAID.\n\nRubio agrees, in principle, with major changes, including staff reductions and closing some diplomatic facilities. But he wants to restructure the department in a way that satisfies Trump and keeps Musk at bay but safeguards his main base of power. If he lets Musk and DOGE eliminate huge chunks of State without a serious strategy, he will only weaken the department and himself. Foreign officials trying to understand Trump administration dynamics are among those watching closely and asking people like myself if Rubio is the best point of contact.\n\n\u201cRubio wants to be a diplomat,\u201d the person familiar with the situation said. \u201cEverything DOGE does creates problems for him in terms of diplomacy.\u201d\n\nAlthough lists of consulates to close and staffers to fire have been circulating for weeks, Rubio still hasn\u2019t acted, frustrating Musk.\n\nSome Rubio aides and people at the National Security Council tried last week to push out Marocco, who is not in DOGE but is a lead figure in dismantling USAID. Rubio, however, sided with other senior administration officials who wanted to keep Marocco, according to the person familiar with the situation.\n\nThe official close to Rubio denied there was any such attempt. Marocco\u2019s team emailed me a statement from him in which he called Trump and Rubio \u201chistoric patriots\u201d and said it was the \u201chonor of a lifetime\u201d to serve the pair to \u201creform and realign foreign assistance,\u201d but he did not address questions about his job.\n\nThe official further urged patience \u2014 a hard ask of U.S. diplomats who fear for their jobs and livelihoods.\n\n\u201cGood, substantive reforms take time,\u201d the official said. \u201cThe president\u2019s been pretty clear that there need to be significant changes in the way that the federal government is organized. I think every Cabinet secretary is going about that in their own specific way to make sure those changes are smart, they stick and that core capabilities and functions are retained.\u201d\n\nThe State Department declined to comment, but a senior official there stressed that Musk and Rubio have a \u201cgreat relationship\u201d and are working together \u201cto correct the failures of the last administration.\u201d\n\nMusk did not respond to my request for comment.\n\nTrump is trying to appease all sides. During last week\u2019s meeting, he told Cabinet members they get to run their agencies but also said Musk would serve as an enforcer to ensure cuts take place.\n\nThe president also has insisted that Rubio and Musk get along just fine. \u201cELON AND MARCO HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP. ANY STATEMENT OTHER THAN THAT IS FAKE NEWS!!!\u201d Trump posted this weekend on Truth Social.\n\nRubio and Musk are now trying to publicly show that\u2019s true.\n\nRubio used social media to thank DOGE for slashing USAID\u2019s programs, to which Musk replied that it was \u201cgood\u201d working with Rubio. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt noted to reporters that the pair attended dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Saturday.\n\nAnd Rubio and Musk took to social media this weekend to gang up on Rados\u0142aw Sikorski, the foreign minister of Poland, a U.S. ally.\n\nAfter Musk said that Ukraine\u2019s front line could collapse if he turned off his Starlink satellite services, Sikorski noted that his country was paying for those services and might have to find other providers if they were turned off.\n\nRubio dismissed Sikorski as \u201cmaking up\u201d the threat and told him to \u201csay thank you\u201d for Starlink. Musk piled on: \u201cBe quiet, small man.\u201d\n\nPerhaps beating up on common enemies \u2014 a group that these days includes U.S. allies \u2014 is the glue that will bond Rubio and Musk together going forward.\n\nThat said, the secretary of State has some tough choices ahead as he restructures his department. He has managed to slow-roll Musk on that front for now, but we\u2019ll see how long the forced bonhomie lasts.",

        "full_text": "\u201cOur caucus is unified\u201d on such a measure to \u201ckeep the government open and give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan legislation that can pass,\u201d Mr. Schumer said in a brief statement from the floor.\n\nThe announcement left congressional leaders without a clear path to avert a shutdown that would begin at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday should Congress fail to act by then to extend federal funding. Senate Republicans would need the support of at least eight Democrats to overcome procedural hurdles and bring a spending measure to a final vote. Just one, Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, has so far declared he would vote to break any filibuster.\n\nThe standoff puts Senate Democrats at risk of being blamed for any shutdown even as they complain about Trump administration disruptions to federal agencies. But they are under pressure from House Democrats and activists to stand against Mr. Trump and Elon Musk as they lead an effort to dismantle broad swaths of the federal bureaucracy, in some cases in direct defiance of Congress, which holds the power of the purse.\n\nWith two days left before the shutdown deadline, there is still time for a reversal by Democrats. But most of them have heaped criticism on Republicans\u2019 stopgap spending measure, arguing that it would give Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk too much leeway to continue their unilateral efforts to slash government employees and programs.\n\nRepublicans, who control both chambers, have shown no willingness to compromise with Democrats on the spending measure. And even if they agreed to, changing the House bill or approving a different one would require the House to return and vote again, which is highly unlikely. Republican leaders deliberately adjourned the chamber on Tuesday night and left town after passing the spending legislation, known as a continuing resolution, to effectively force the Senate to accept it.\n\nThe private meetings this week have laid bare a major dilemma for Democrats as they wrestle with how to respond to the Republican legislation. Senators said they had two unappealing alternatives. They could oppose the G.O.P. plan and potentially take the blame for a damaging federal shutdown or surrender to Mr. Trump and incite the wrath of Democrats demanding that their representatives thwart the White House at every turn.\n\n\u201cThere are really only two options,\u201d said Senator Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats. \u201cOne is to vote for a pretty bad C.R., or the other is to vote for a potentially even worse shutdown. It is a very tough choice.\u201d\n\nEven as Mr. Schumer declared his party\u2019s opposition, Democrats privately continued to deliberate over a way to avoid a shutdown without appearing to capitulate to Mr. Trump. Some suggested allowing the stopgap spending bill to move forward as long as Republicans agreed to give them a chance to revise it on the Senate floor. That would afford Democrats the chance to make their political case against the measure and show that they were fighting it, even if their proposals for changes ultimately failed.\n\nBut as House Democratic leaders gathered for a retreat in Virginia on Wednesday, they pleaded with their Senate counterparts to follow their lead and oppose the government funding bill outright.\n\nRepresentative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, called the measure \u201ca power grab that further unleashes and entrenches Elon Musk\u2019s efforts.\u201d He applauded his caucus for sticking together on Tuesday in voting against it and sending a clear message of repudiation for its policies on the House floor. All but one Democrat opposed the measure in the House.\n\nIn the Senate, virtually all Democrats are opposed to the stopgap bill, which cleared the House largely along party lines on Tuesday. They view it as an abdication of congressional power and a woefully inefficient way of funding the government while providing Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk more opportunity to slice into federal agencies. They also noted that it broke from an earlier bipartisan deal on both domestic and military spending.\n\n\u201cInstead of writing a bill that gives our communities what they need, they wrote a bill that turns many of our accounts into slush funds,\u201d said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. The bill, she added, \u201cgives the final say over what gets funding to two billionaires who don\u2019t know the first thing about the needs of our working families.\u201d\n\nShe and her fellow Senate Democrats would much prefer to pass the individual spending bills that have been negotiated between the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Appropriations Committees. But House Republicans pulled back from those talks in favor of the decision to freeze most funding through Sept. 30, leaving only two remaining possibilities: blocking the spending bill or approving it.\n\nSenator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, said Democrats should not give in \u201cjust because the House decided to leave town on a Tuesday night.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean the Senate shouldn\u2019t be a deliberative body,\u201d he added.\n\nDespite their opposition to the spending plan, top Democrats are leery of forcing the government into a shutdown, fearing the political blowback after years of castigating Republicans for shutdowns.\n\nIn addition, Democrats worried that a shutdown would play into the hands of Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk, empowering them to keep hollowing out federal agencies. Democrats also argued that it remained unclear how any shutdown would end once it began. And they conceded that it could undercut their criticism of the Department of Government Efficiency as an out-of-control buzz saw shredding the government, if they were the ones refusing to extend funding for federal agencies.\n\nRepublicans were already trying to take advantage of their predicament.\n\n\u201cIf I listen to our colleagues across the aisle, they claim to have a lot of concern for the federal workers that depend on government funding,\u201d said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas. \u201cSo I find interesting that so many of them in the House cast a vote that would put thousands, even hundreds of thousands, of federal workers out of work.\u201d\n\nRelenting to Republicans was certain to inflame House Democrats and advocacy groups who were demanding that Senate Democrats remain united against the legislation.\n\nMore than 150 progressive and environmental groups on Wednesday sent Senate Democratic leaders a letter urging them to \u201cstand strong until Musk and Trump stop their illegal actions to dismantle key federal programs.\u201d\n\nAt least one Democrat said causing a shutdown would clear the way for additional harm.\n\n\u201cIf any of those groups want to shut the government down, I would disagree with them,\u201d Mr. Fetterman said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that long ago that we were lecturing Republicans who were threatening to shut the government down. Now I think we are in the same situation.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have excoriated Republicans, saying they acted irresponsibly in shuttering federal agencies in past funding fights.\n\nMr. Schumer and his fellow Democrats did prompt a shutdown in 2018 as they sought to win protections for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children. But they capitulated after a brief weekend closure, when lawmakers concluded that the strategy was backfiring and angering the public.\n\nThey have sought to make certain they were not blamed in any government funding lapses since then.\n\nAnnie Karni contributed reporting from Leesburg, Va.\n\nThe suit accused employees of Southwest Key, which has worked with the federal government for more than two decades, of exploiting \u201cchildren\u2019s vulnerabilities, language barriers and distance from family and loved ones\u201d from 2015 through at least 2023, including President Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi, in the statement, blamed the Biden administration\u2019s immigration policies for enabling the abuses.\n\n\u201cUnder the border policies of the previous administration, bad actors were incentivized to exploit children and break our laws: this ends now,\u201d Ms. Bondi said, adding, \u201csecuring our border and protecting children from abuse are among the most critical missions of the Department of Justice and the Trump administration.\u201d\n\nAnais Biera Miracle, a spokeswoman for Southwest Key, maintained the nonprofit denied the claims of abuse. She said it was \u201cpleased\u201d that the Justice Department had dropped the case in its entirety, and that charges cannot be refiled.\n\n\u201cThere is no settlement or payment required,\u201d Ms. Miracle said in an email. \u201cWe are glad this matter is now concluded.\u201d\n\nAbuse and harassment were also alleged to have taken place during President Trump\u2019s first term, including during his policy of family separation, which forced thousands of additional minors into federal custody. In a complaint filed in July, federal prosecutors reported that Southwest Key employees subjected minors to threats of violence to prevent them from reporting rape, solicitations of sex and entreaties for nude photographs, among other inappropriate conduct and abuse for at least eight years, across three presidential administrations.\n\nAt the time the complaint was filed, the H.H.S., which assumes responsibility for housing children who arrive at the southern border unaccompanied by parents or legal guardians, continued to place minors at shelters run by Southwest Key even as prosecutors asked that the nonprofit face penalties and that it pay damages to the victims.\n\nThe decision appears to conclude a gradual reversal of fortune for Southwest Key, which has worked with the federal government for more than two decades, operating more than 25 shelters across Texas, Arizona and California. It has been awarded more than $6 billion in federal funds since 2007. After the H.H.S. announced that it would review its grants to Southwest Key, Ms. Miracle, the spokeswoman, said that the government had frozen funding and put in place a stop placement order on Southwest Key shelters, forcing the nonprofit to furlough about 5,000 employees.\n\nHousing underage migrants for the federal government has been a financial boon for contractors like Southwest Key, whose award money more than doubled during the family separation policy overseen by Mr. Trump in 2017 and 2018. It was one of several providers that cashed in as the administration scrambled to find shelter for more than 5,000 children forced into federal custody, turning the care of migrant children into a billion-dollar business with little transparency.\n\nThe New York Times revealed in 2018 that Southwest Key had funneled government money through a web of for-profit companies to convert public funds into private money for the organization and pay top executives millions of dollars. Shortly after, the Justice Department opened an investigation into possible financial improprieties. Southwest Key also began an internal inquiry, and high-level executives, including its founder and chief financial officer, eventually resigned.\n\nThe complaint filed by the Justice Department last year disclosed that Southwest Key had documented dozens of cases of abuse reported by children, the majority of whom were 13 to 17 and came from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. But Southwest Key\u2019s employees did not report abuse they had observed or knew of, or any violations of policies intended to protect minors.\n\nBy one account, a worker who sexually abused three girls ages 5, 8 and 11 threatened to kill their families if they told. In another case documented by Southwest Key, a supervisor deliberately changed shifts to be alone with a teenage girl he repeatedly raped, abused and threatened. At night, he would enter her bedroom and those of others in violation of Southwest Key\u2019s policies. The girl was transferred to a different shelter after she reported the abuse.\n\nAt the time, a spokeswoman for Southwest Key said that the complaint did not \u201cpresent the accurate picture of the care and commitment our employees provide to the youth and children,\u201d and that the company remained focused on \u201cthe safety, health and well-being\u201d of the children at its shelters.\n\nThe subpoena requested testimony and evidence from the hotel related to \u201can alleged violation\u201d of federal immigration law. It asked the hotel for the names of entities and individuals responsible for the \u201cfunding and management of the illegal immigrant/migrant shelter program,\u201d as well as any contracts or agreements related to it.\n\nIt was unclear why prosecutors sent a subpoena to the Chandler, a hotel on East 31st Street that was converted into a homeless shelter years ago but does not operate as a shelter for migrants.\n\nThe investigation appears focused at least in part on the management and funding of hotels acting as shelters, but its full scope was unclear as of Wednesday, as was whether other hotels had received subpoenas.\n\nThe grand jury subpoena was issued by the office of the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. A spokesman for the office, Nicholas Biase, referred questions to the Department of Justice in Washington. A spokesman there declined to comment on what he said was \u201can ongoing criminal investigation,\u201d adding that he could not discuss the scope or contours of the inquiry.\n\nNew York City, which is housing about 43,000 migrants in shelters across the city, including dozens of converted hotels, had not received a subpoena as of Wednesday, according to an official briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter.\n\nLiz Garcia, a spokeswoman for Mayor Eric Adams, declined to comment, saying, \u201cWe cannot comment on any type of federal investigation.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian first reported on Wednesday that a Manhattan hotel, which they did not name, had received a subpoena.\n\nThe city\u2019s migrant shelters have been criticized and scrutinized by the Trump administration, which has made New York City, the country\u2019s largest sanctuary jurisdiction, a target of its immigration crackdown.\n\nThe city entered into multimillion-dollar contracts with more than 100 hotels as it struggled to house the more than 230,000 migrants who have arrived in the city seeking shelter since early 2022. Republicans have long decried the use of hotels as shelters to house migrants as wasteful spending of taxpayer funding.\n\nLast month, the Trump administration abruptly clawed back $80 million in federal funds from the city\u2019s bank accounts that was meant to cover some expenses associated with paying hotels to shelter migrants.\n\nIn doing so, the federal government singled out the Roosevelt Hotel in Midtown, which the city had converted into its main processing center for migrants. The Trump administration depicted it as a safe haven for migrant gangs. Shortly after, the city announced it would shut down the Roosevelt Hotel by June, citing a sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in the city.\n\nWilliam K. Rashbaum contributed reporting, and Sheelagh McNeill contributed research.\n\nThe spokeswoman, McLaurine Pinover, is not the only member of the Trump administration to have used her federal office to promote outside business interests, but former agency officials and ethics watchdogs say that the timing and content of the videos were both unlawful and especially tone-deaf.\n\nGovernment watchdogs say the videos, coming from the spokeswoman of the agency driving the layoffs of thousands of federal workers, exemplify a widespread disregard for government ethics across the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s illegal for a public employee to promote a private company in their government office,\u201d said Donald Sherman, the executive director and chief counsel for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government watchdog group.\n\n\u201cOn its own, maybe it would qualify as small potatoes, but context matters,\u201d Mr. Sherman added. \u201cIn the context of a president and an administration that are routinely engaged in profiteering and using the office of the presidency for financial gain, in the context of someone who owns a private company, Elon Musk, coming into the administration and dismantling the government as he has, and in the context of O.P.M. being central to the administration\u2019s attack on civil servants who actually want to be there to work for the American public, an O.P.M. political appointee engaging in this conduct is egregious.\u201d\n\nThough presidents are legally exempt from certain conflict of interest laws, President Trump has not divested from many business interests, some of which involve real estate deals with foreign governments that could influence his diplomatic decisions. Mr. Musk, the tech billionaire whom Mr. Trump deputized to slash the federal government, continues to pursue federal contracts for his private businesses.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, the day news of Ms. Pinover\u2019s Instagram account broke, Mr. Trump made a show of purchasing a red Model S from Tesla, of which Mr. Musk is chief executive, on the White House grounds, just a day after the company\u2019s stock crashed.\n\nMs. Pinover\u2019s short videos, each four to nine seconds, featured her in her office, lightheartedly modeling her clothes, applying makeup, working at her desk and occasionally blowing a kiss to the camera. They also included links to the clothes that would give her a commission from fans\u2019 purchases.\n\nThe existence of Ms. Pinover\u2019s accounts was first reported by . The Instagram account has since been deleted, while the account that would supply commissions, ShopMy, has been wiped clean, save for Ms. Pinover\u2019s name and picture and an invitation to \u201cShop my looks!\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Ms. Pinover said she never made any money from the fashion videos.\n\n\u201cWhile I was battling breast cancer as a new mom, I felt so unlike myself. I turned to social media shortly after as a personal outlet,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI never made any income and with only about 800 followers, I\u2019m surprised the so-called \u2018newspaper of record\u2019 finds this newsworthy. My focus remains on serving the American people at O.P.M.\u201d\n\nWhether she actually profited off the enterprise is irrelevant, Mr. Sherman said. The purpose of the account was to promote the clothing.\n\nMs. Pinover took on her role in the Trump administration in January, but her Instagram account \u2014 and the start of her fashion influencer videos \u2014 predated that job. Before she joined the Trump administration, she worked as a senior director for the Herald Group, a communications and advocacy firm, starting in August 2023. Before that, Ms. Pinover was a spokeswoman for Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nFormer O.P.M. employees said that Ms. Pinover should have been warned against pursuing supplementary income streams, particularly on government property, as part of a standard ethics briefing employees receive when joining the agency.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Ms. Pinover had been explicitly warned against such activity when she started the job. White House representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cUse of public property to film one\u2019s \u2018fashion influencer\u2019 videos should raise lots of ethical questions about how seriously the Trump administration is taking their oaths,\u201d said Viet Tran, the deputy communications director of O.P.M. during the Biden administration, a political appointment. \u201cWhether it\u2019s Trump hawking Teslas on the South Lawn, SpaceX employees meddling in competitor contracts at F.A.A., or using your government offices for personal enrichment, it looks awful all around.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the campaign trail to Day 1 and beyond, President Trump has delivered on his promise to unleash energy dominance and lower the cost of living,\u201d Mr. Zeldin said. \u201cWe at E.P.A. will do our part to power the great American comeback.\u201d\n\nNowhere in the video did he refer to protecting the environment or public health, twin tenets that have guided the agency since its founding in 1970.\n\nThe E.P.A. has \u201cno obligation to promote agriculture or commerce; only the critical obligation to protect and enhance the environment,\u201d the first administrator, William D. Ruckelshaus, said as he explained its mission to the country weeks after the E.P.A. was created by President Richard M. Nixon. He said the agency would be focused on research, standards and enforcement in five areas: air pollution, water pollution, waste disposal, radiation and pesticides.\n\nMr. Zeldin said the E.P.A. would unwind more than two dozen protections against air and water pollution. It would overturn limits on soot from smokestacks that have been linked to respiratory problems in humans and premature deaths as well as restrictions on emissions of mercury, a neurotoxin. It would get rid of the \u201cgood neighbor rule\u201d that requires states to address their own pollution when it\u2019s carried by winds into neighboring states. And it would eliminate enforcement efforts that prioritize the protection of poor and minority communities.\n\nIn addition, when the agency creates environmental policy, it would no longer consider the costs to society from wildfires, droughts, storms and other disasters that might be made worse by pollution connected to that policy, Mr. Zeldin said.\n\nIn perhaps its most consequential act, the agency said it would work to erase the E.P.A.\u2019s legal authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by reconsidering decades of science that show global warming is endangering humanity. In his video, Mr. Zeldin derisively referred to that legal underpinning as \u201cthe holy grail of the climate change religion.\u201d\n\nMr. Zeldin called Wednesday\u2019s actions \u201cthe largest deregulatory announcement in U.S. history.\u201d He added, \u201ctoday the green new scam ends, as the E.P.A. does its part to usher in a golden age of American success.\u201d\n\nThe announcements do not carry the force of law. In almost every case, the E.P.A. would have to undergo a lengthy process of public comment and develop environmental and economic justifications for the change.\n\nPresident Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, campaigned on a promise to \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d and ease regulations on fossil fuel companies. Since returning to the White House, he has degraded the government\u2019s capacity to fight global warming by freezing funds for climate programs authorized by Congress, firing scientists working on weather and climate forecasts, and cutting federal support for the transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nThe United States is the world\u2019s largest historic emitter of carbon dioxide, a planet-warming greenhouse gas that scientists agree is driving climate change and intensifying hurricanes, floods, wildfires and droughts, as well as species extinction. Last year was the hottest in recorded history, and the United States experienced 27 disasters that each cost at least $1 billion, compared to three in 1980, adjusted for inflation.\n\nDemocrats and environmental activists decried Mr. Zeldin\u2019s moves and accused him of abandoning the E.P.A.\u2019s responsibility to protect human health and the environment.\n\n\u201cToday is the day Trump\u2019s Big Oil megadonors paid for,\u201d Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, said. He called the E.P.A. moves a series of attacks on clean air, clean water and affordable energy. \u201cAdministrator Zeldin clearly lied when he told us that he would respect the science and listen to the experts,\u201d Mr. Whitehouse said, referring to Mr. Zeldin\u2019s confirmation hearing.\n\nGina McCarthy, who served as E.P.A. administrator in the Obama administration, said it was \u201cthe most disastrous day in EPA history. Rolling these rules back is not just a disgrace, it\u2019s a threat to all of us. The agency has fully abdicated its mission to protect Americans\u2019 health and well being.\u201d\n\nJackie Wong, senior vice president for climate change and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said repealing or weakening regulations on automobiles, power plants and more would lead to increases in asthma, heart attacks and other health problems. \u201cAt a time when millions of Americans are trying to rebuild after horrific wildfires and climate-fueled hurricanes, it\u2019s nonsensical to try to deny that climate change harms our health and welfare,\u201d said Ms. Wong, whose organization successfully sued the first Trump administration repeatedly over environmental rollbacks.\n\nThe Trump administration had been signaling for months that it would reverse many of the climate regulations enacted during the Biden administration. But the cascade of announcements, timed with an op-ed by Mr. Zeldin in The Wall Street Journal and the online video, was designed to attract attention before he is expected to address oil, gas and other energy providers at an annual gathering in Houston.\n\nBy midafternoon, the agency had counted 31 pronouncements that were designed, Mr. Zeldin said, to \u201cunleash American energy.\u201d\n\nThe top lobbying groups for the automobile, oil, gas and chemical industries, among others, applauded Mr. Zeldin\u2019s plans.\n\nAnne Bradbury, the chief executive of the American Exploration & Production Council, a lobbying group representing oil and gas companies, called the announcements \u201ccommon sense.\u201d John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the auto lobby, said the changes would keep the industry \u201cglobally competitive.\u201d\n\nMarty Durbin, a senior vice president at the United States Chamber of Commerce, said, \u201cAmerican businesses were crippled with an unprecedented regulatory onslaught during the previous Administration that contributed to higher costs felt by families around the country.\u201d He said \u201cThe Chamber supports a more balanced regulatory approach that will protect the environment and support greater economic growth.\u201d\n\nGroups that deny the established science of climate change also cheered Mr. Zeldin\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cThe Biden E.P.A. ignored the will of Congress, infringed on individual freedom, trampled on property rights and tried to force the country to use unreliable sources of electricity, such as wind and solar,\u201d said a statement from Daren Bakst, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a think tank allied with the fossil fuel industry that believes global warming has been minimal and is good for humanity and the biosphere.\n\nSome of the most significant policy changes Mr. Zeldin said he planned include:\n\nRolling back restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. Currently the E.P.A. requires existing coal-burning power plants and new gas plants built in the United States to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions by 90 percent by 2039.\n\nRewriting tailpipe pollution standards that were designed to ensure that the majority of new passenger cars and light trucks sold in the United States are all-electric or hybrids by 2032.\n\nEasing limits on mercury emissions from power plants, as well as restrictions on soot and haze from burning coal. A Biden-era rule had aimed to slash by 70 percent emissions from coal-burning power plants of mercury, which has been linked to developmental damage in children.\n\nGreatly reducing the \u201csocial cost\u201d of carbon, an economic estimate of the damage caused by each additional ton of carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere. That figure plays a significant role in weighing the costs and benefits of regulating industries.\n\nPerhaps the most significant move, though, is an effort to revise a 2009 legal opinion known as the E.P.A. \u201cendangerment finding\u201d which concluded that rising greenhouse gas emissions are a danger to public health. The finding gives the agency the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Eliminating it would make it virtually impossible for the E.P.A. to curb climate pollution from automobiles, factories, power plants or oil and gas wells.\n\nReversing the rule has long been the white whale for climate deniers. But doing so would require Mr. Trump\u2019s E.P.A. to make and substantiate the argument that greenhouse gas emissions pose no foreseeable threats to public health, when decades of science says otherwise.\n\nJonathan H. Adler, a conservative legal expert and professor of environmental law at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, said he did not believe the Trump administration would succeed. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to explain away decades of statements by every administration that there are negative consequences of climate change that can be reasonably anticipated,\u201d Mr. Adler said.\n\nHe called the effort to unravel the endangerment finding \u201ca good way to waste years of time and effort and accomplish nothing.\u201d\n\nA correction was made on\n\nMarch 13, 2025\n\n:\n\nAn earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the views of the Climate Enterprise Institute. The group believes global warming has been minimal and good for humanity and the biosphere; it does not promote \u201cclimate denial.\u201d\n\nWhen we learn of a mistake, we acknowledge it with a correction. If you spot an error, please let us know at [email removed] more\n\nMr. Ezell had been ordered to appear before a San Francisco judge as part of a lawsuit brought against the Office of Personnel Management by unions representing some of the fired workers.\n\nAs the office\u2019s acting chief, Mr. Ezell began issuing guidance in January that agencies interpreted as orders to fire federal employees, particularly those with probationary status. That guidance is at the heart of multiple legal challenges, with the once-obscure agency assuming a lead role in President Trump\u2019s government-gutting initiative.\n\nAccording to a legal complaint from the employee unions, Mr. Ezell held a meeting on Feb. 13 with the heads of many federal agencies in which he ordered them to fire tens of thousands of employees. The next day, O.P.M. provided a template to agencies to use for the termination letters, stating that employees were being fired for performance reasons, according to the plaintiffs.\n\nThe unions argued that O.P.M. does not have the authority to make such personnel decisions and asked the court to rule that the office\u2019s orders were illegal and force the government to stop firing people at their direction.\n\nMr. Ezell filed a declaration on Feb. 26 asserting that he did not order the agencies to fire anyone, and that the memos from his office were intended only as \u201cguidance.\u201d The same day, lawyers for the unions filed examples of correspondence from O.P.M. that they argue show that the memos were indeed orders.\n\nA day later, the judge presiding over the case, William Alsup of the Northern District of California, heard arguments from both sides about O.P.M.\u2019s role in the mass firings at the agencies involved in the lawsuit, including the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management and the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nJudge Alsup concluded that O.P.M. has no legal authority to order the agencies to fire anyone, ordered that the government retract the memos and said the government should put a stop to unlawful personnel moves. He also scheduled a hearing for Thursday, March 13, making clear he wanted Mr. Ezell to appear.\n\nO.P.M. responded to his order by retracting the original memos, but the government disputed the need for Mr. Ezell\u2019s testimony. Judge Alsup disagreed, ordering on Monday that Mr. Ezell come before the court.\n\n\u201cThe problem here is that Acting Director Ezell submitted a sworn declaration in support of defendants\u2019 position, but now refuses to appear to be cross-examined, or to be deposed,\u201d Judge Alsup wrote Monday.\n\nOn Tuesday, the government confirmed that Mr. Ezell would not comply. Government lawyers said his testimony is not necessary \u201cbecause existing documentary evidence and briefing demonstrates that O.P.M. is not directing agencies to terminate probationary employees.\u201d\n\nSince the lawsuit was filed, the unions have drastically expanded its scope, including fired employees from 28 agencies, up from the five in the initial complaint.\n\nThe broader scope reflects the extraordinary personnel actions that have been taken since Mr. Trump\u2019s return to office and the opacity surrounding who is responsible for orchestrating the wholesale changes that have been ordered by O.P.M. \u2014 Mr. Trump or his government downsizing guru, the tech billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nDuring his address to a joint session of Congress on March 4, Mr. Trump said Mr. Musk is the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, which is overseeing the culling of the federal government. Two days later, Mr. Trump told members of his cabinet that they are the ones in charge of reducing the number of employees at their agencies, not Mr. Musk.\n\nYet members of Mr. Musk\u2019s team continue to show up at federal agencies demanding data and documents and operating with outsized importance.\n\nMr. Ezell\u2019s testimony on Thursday would have given lawyers representing the unions the opportunity to press him on O.P.M.\u2019s role in how Mr. Trump\u2019s government overhaul is being carried out. According to a court filing after the government\u2019s notice informing the judge that Mr. Ezell would not testify, the court clerk said Thursday\u2019s hearing would go on as planned.\n\nMr. Ezell took over as leader of O.P.M. on Inauguration Day. Before that, he was a lower-level official at the agency, overseeing data analytics. He also previously served as a consultant to the agency, according to his LinkedIn page.\n\nZach Montague and Devlin Barrett contributed reporting.\n\nIt remains unclear if the department plans to farm out cases to U.S. attorney\u2019s offices around the country, as has been discussed internally; use the shift to drastically cut the number of investigations; or both.\n\nThe move, like the forced transfers or firings of career nonpolitical prosecutors in recent weeks, is part of an effort to reduce the power of divisions that Trump appointees claim were politically \u201cweaponized\u201d or otherwise overused under the Biden administration.\n\nChad Gilmartin, a department spokesman, would not comment on specific plans but said the department\u2019s leadership was \u201cmaking sure our resources are being utilized in a way that assures the mission to make America safe again is successful.\u201d\n\nThe changes being considered would affect prosecutors inside the Justice Department\u2019s public integrity division, along with units that prosecute foreign corruption cases and conduct investigations focused on money laundering and asset recovery, the people said.\n\nThe public integrity unit, which focuses on criminal cases against elected officials, has already been particularly hard hit. Several of its prosecutors resigned last month after top officials pushed to drop a bribery case against New York\u2019s mayor, Eric Adams.\n\nOne of the few anti-fraud units inside the department\u2019s main office likely to be spared from the changes is a division that focuses on health care cases.\n\nThis week, senior Justice Department officials consulted with members of the public integrity team and urged them to find positions in other parts of the department, according to a person with knowledge of the exchange. The unit was once run by Jack Smith, the former special counsel who investigated Donald J. Trump.\n\nDepartment officials signaled that the corruption and fraud units inside headquarters, known as Main Justice, could be reduced from an original complement of two dozen to three dozen prosecutors to as few as 10 each, the people familiar with the changes said.\n\nJust as important, the units could be stripped of their ability to file indictments on their own, diminishing them more or less to an advisory role with no real law enforcement powers, they added.\n\nOfficials have long discussed moving fraud and corruption cases from Washington to some of the Justice Department\u2019s 93 U.S. attorney\u2019s offices. That is in keeping with the administration\u2019s overarching belief that federal law enforcement embedded in the states is better suited to investigate corruption and fraud in its own jurisdiction, one of those familiar with the planning effort said.\n\nThe move comes at a time of intense turmoil inside the department, which has experienced a flurry of firings, demotions and personnel changes in the past two months. And the restructuring of the units was only the latest effort by the administration to alter the way that fraud and corruption cases are handled.\n\nLast month, Mr. Trump signed an executive order halting all investigations and prosecutions of corporate corruption in foreign countries under a law known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. He argued that pursuing such cases hurt the United States\u2019 competitive edge.\n\nAdministration officials have also ordered the shutdown of a Justice Department initiative to seize assets owned by foreign kleptocrats.\n\nThat action came after he revoked security clearances held by any lawyers at the firm Covington & Burling who were helping provide legal advice to Jack Smith, the special counsel who brought two federal indictments against Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s actions, and open threats of more to come, have shaken law firms across Washington and beyond, leaving them looking at their client lists and wondering whether their representation could put them in the president\u2019s cross hairs and endanger their business. Perkins Coie has acknowledged that in just the few days since Mr. Trump signed the executive order it \u201chas already lost significant revenue\u201d because of clients who have severed their relationship with the firm.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly the biggest affront to the legal profession in my lifetime,\u201d said Samuel W. Buell, who is a longtime professor of law at Duke University and a former federal prosecutor.\n\nA federal judge on Wednesday sided with Perkins Coie in an initial courtroom skirmish with the White House, temporarily barring a major portion of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order against the firm from taking effect.\n\n\u201cI am sure that many in the profession are watching in horror at what Perkins Coie is going through,\u201d said Judge Beryl A. Howell of the Federal District Court in Washington. She added, \u201cIt sends little chills down my spine\u201d to hear arguments that a president can punish individuals and companies like this.\n\nHer reaction mirrored those of other legal experts who said the issues at stake go far beyond whether or not Mr. Trump will make life difficult for elite law firms and well-paid lawyers.\n\nThe experts say Mr. Trump\u2019s actions could create a trickle-down effect in which those who find themselves under scrutiny from Mr. Trump and his administration struggle to find lawyers who are willing to defend them in the face of the vast powers of the federal government. Those facing scrutiny could be forced to turn to less skilled lawyers or firms that enjoy access or good ties to the White House, the experts say.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a political enemy, you really need the best representation when the government comes after you for who you are,\u201d said Daniel C. Richman, a professor of law at Columbia University and former federal prosecutor. \u201cChilling the lawyers who represent those people hurts the rule of law because when the government can\u2019t be legally opposed, the law provides no protections to anyone and you start to live in an autocracy.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s attack on Big Law comes as his administration has also gone after law schools, the American Bar Association and even lawyers inside the government itself who might question or hinder his agenda.\n\nLast week, the top federal prosecutor in Washington threatened to stop hiring graduates from Georgetown Law School if its dean, William Treanor, failed to abolish the school\u2019s diversity programs. Mr. Treanor all but dared the prosecutor, Ed Martin, to make good on his threats, saying that the First Amendment would forbid them.\n\nMr. Trump has often relied on pliant lawyers to do his bidding, and last month he fired the three top lawyers in the armed forces who are supposed to advise military leaders on the legality of various policies and operations. The lawyers, known as judge advocates general, were fired without reference to their professional performance, raising concerns that the administration wanted replacements who would be more amenable to Mr. Trump\u2019s orders.\n\nOne of the first big tests of this new era arose late last week, setting off maneuvering that shows how big firms in Washington are rushing to adapt to the new challenges they face, according to interviews with people involved in or briefed on those discussions.\n\nIn his executive order targeting Perkins Coie, Mr. Trump was going after a firm that represented Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign and repeatedly won election law cases in 2020 against Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. Mr. Trump singled out Perkins Coie\u2019s involvement in a dossier complied during the 2016 campaign by a former British spy about Mr. Trump\u2019s potential ties to Russia.\n\nAmid concerns in the legal community about a chilling effect, few, if any, major firms issued statements condemning Mr. Trump\u2019s action. And amid that silence there was a question about whether any firm would take the even bigger step of agreeing to represent Perkins Coie in its effort to challenge Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order in court.\n\nPerkins Coie reached out to Derek L. Shaffer, a lawyer at the firm Quinn Emanuel. Mr. Shaffer had a long history of bringing civil actions against federal and state governments, and had argued before the Supreme Court three times. Perkins Coie wanted to see if he could take on the firm as a client and quickly go to court to file a suit against the Trump administration to stop the executive order.\n\nConvincing Mr. Shaffer to take the case would come with a major potential bonus: close links to Mr. Trump and his allies.\n\nLawyers at Quinn Emanuel represent Elon Musk and provide ethics advice to the Trump Organization. The firm has also represented Mayor Eric Adams of New York as the Trump Justice Department has moved swiftly to drop corruption charges against Mr. Adams, a Democrat.\n\nBut Perkins Coie was rebuffed. Quinn Emanuel decided against taking the case. Its top leaders concluded that this was not an issue they wanted to jump into at this stage as they continue to build themselves into a power center in Mr. Trump\u2019s Washington.\n\nOther major law firms expressed concerns that if they represented Perkins Coie, they, too, could face Mr. Trump\u2019s ire. Leaders of top firms asked: How would their own clients react if Mr. Trump cut off their access to the government?\n\nIn response, the elite Washington firm Williams and Connolly decided it would take on Perkins Coie as a client.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why Williams and Connolly was willing to take a risk that other firms were not. But lawyers at Williams and Connolly have long taken pride in their role as an adversary and check against the government, including by highlighting the firm\u2019s role in protecting high-profile defendants against prosecutorial misconduct. The firm was founded by the well-known defense lawyer Edward Bennett Williams, who built his career on vigorously representing an array of clients before the government, including those out of political favor.\n\nOn Tuesday, Williams and Connolly, on behalf of Perkins Coie, filed suit against the Trump administration in Washington. That suit led to Judge Howell\u2019s ruling on Wednesday imposing a temporary restraining order to block for now the section of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order that essentially barred Perkins Coie from dealing with federal officials and prevented it from entering government buildings. She said the executive order was most likely unconstitutional.\n\nOther law firms have been discussing whether to file a joint amicus brief on behalf of Perkins Coie. While some major firms have signaled they are willing to sign onto it, others have said they are reluctant. On Wednesday, 21 state attorneys general filed their own amicus brief supporting Perkins Coie.\n\nCovington & Burling, which had the security clearance stripped from a lawyer at the firm who was assisting Mr. Smith, has taken a different approach from that of Perkins Coie.\n\nCovington has declined to fight Mr. Trump in court. Instead, the firm, concerned about a perception among its clients that it was falling out of favor with Mr. Trump, has begun discussions with other prominent law firms with fewer ties to Mr. Trump\u2019s perceived enemies about becoming the face of some of their most important cases before the Justice Department.\n\nBut beyond what Mr. Trump has done to law firms, the political appointees he has placed at departments, agencies and commissions are taking on the legal profession in other ways.\n\nOne of Mr. Trump\u2019s political appointees has ordered government officials under him to not renew their memberships to the American Bar Association, hold a position with the association or attend its events.\n\nAt the Justice Department, the attorney general has sent a letter to the American Bar Association questioning its diversity practices.\n\nAnd last week, at an annual conference on white-collar crime for the association, a slew of top officials from the Justice Department \u2014 who regularly attend the event \u2014 canceled at the last minute. That meant that a conference designed to bring together the industry about an important topic was devoid of senior department officials in charge of enforcing the law.\n\nAbbie VanSickle and Alan Feuer contributed reporting.\n\nA correction was made on\n\nMarch 12, 2025\n\n:\n\nAn earlier version of this story referred imprecisely to an element of the executive order President Trump issued about the law firm Covington & Burling. The order stripped security clearances from any lawyers at the firm who assisted the former special counsel Jack Smith. It did not strip security clearances from the firm.\n\nWhen we learn of a mistake, we acknowledge it with a correction. If you spot an error, please let us know at [email removed] more\n\nBut news of the proposed appointment generated blowback on the right. A senior administration official said Ms. Gabbard reconsidered her choice given the criticism, and other officials confirmed the decision.\n\nMr. Davis is a senior fellow at Defense Priorities, a think tank with funding from Charles Koch that has a number of alumni in key positions in the Trump administration. Defense Priorities has taken a skeptical view of U.S. military involvement in the Middle East and has supported Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to reach an immediate cease-fire in the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe abandoned appointment has highlighted an emerging foreign policy fault line in the new administration. The Trump administration has appointed both more hawkish Republicans, like Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Michael Waltz, the national security adviser, and officials far more skeptical of American intervention, including Ms. Gabbard.\n\nThe tug of war over Mr. Davis\u2019s appointment also highlighted the strain among supporters of Mr. Trump\u2019s over U.S. support of Israel.\n\nBefore Mr. Davis\u2019s appointment was pulled, the Anti-Defamation League said on Wednesday that the appointment would be \u201cextremely dangerous.\u201d In a social media post, the group accused Mr. Davis of minimizing Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7, 2023, attack and undermining American support for Israel.\n\nConsideration of Mr. Davis had also upset some hawkish conservatives in Congress who began quietly trying to get the administration to rethink it. These officials believed Mr. Davis\u2019s skepticism of the war in Gaza could weaken the Trump administration\u2019s support for Israel.\n\nFormer intelligence officials were also critical of the pick. Marc Polymeropoulos, a former C.I.A. operations officer and a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said Mr. Davis\u2019s positions were outside the ideological mainstream of the Republican Party.\n\n\u201cHis overt criticism of Israel and total opposition to any military action against Iran seems to run counter to current administration policy,\u201d Mr. Polymeropoulos said.\n\nAllies of Mr. Davis had defended him and said there was no hint of antisemitism or opposition to Israel in his work. He is skeptical of military action when it does not directly align with American interests, they say, and troubled by the use of proxies when the United States is unwilling to put its own troops in harm\u2019s way.\n\nWhile some of Mr. Davis\u2019s criticisms of Israel are well outside the mainstream of the Republican Party, they are similar to certain critiques by liberal Democrats. He has spoken frequently about the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump has repeatedly called for Palestinians to be removed from Gaza to allow it to be redeveloped into a beach resort, Mr. Davis has said the removal of people from the territory would be \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201d\n\nIn January, he wrote on social media that U.S. support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza was a \u201cstain on our character as a nation, as a culture, that will not soon go away.\u201d\n\nConsideration of Mr. Davis for the intelligence post was reported earlier by Jewish Insider.\n\nMs. Gabbard has said little about the war in Gaza recently. But many of Mr. Davis\u2019s other positions, including a skepticism of American support for Ukraine\u2019s war effort and his worries about the consequences of the fall of the Syrian government, match her views. And Mr. Davis\u2019s social media feed has been supportive of Ms. Gabbard\u2019s foreign policy positions.\n\nDuring the Biden administration, the head of mission integration conducted many intelligence briefings at the White House. Beth Sanner, who was deputy director of mission integration through much of the first Trump administration, was the primary presidential briefer. Another intelligence official has had that responsibility in the current Trump administration, according to former officials.\n\nIn recent years, senior C.I.A. analysts with decades of experience have had the briefing responsibility. Robert Cardillo, who was the first person ever to hold the job, had been a senior official at the Defense Intelligence Agency.\n\nThe grants were issued to a total of eight nonprofit organizations through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which received $27 billion in funding from Congress through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nBut since taking office, Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A.\u2019s administrator, has tried to claw back the money, saying they were part of a \u201cscheme\u201d and citing as evidence a hidden-camera video from Project Veritas, a conservative group known for using covert recordings to embarrass its political opponents.\n\nThe E.P.A. can cancel the grant contracts if it can document examples of waste, fraud, and abuse by the grantees. But that hasn\u2019t happened at this point.\n\nYesterday, Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee launched an investigation into the E.P.A,\u2019s freezing of the funds and what they said were Mr. Zeldin\u2019s \u201cfalse and misleading statements.\u201d\n\nTwo of the nonprofit grant recipients, Climate United and the Coalition for Green Capital, said they will fight the cancellation. A court hearing on a related case is scheduled for Wednesday.\n\nHere is what we know about the $20 billion in funding and how it became a target of the E.P.A.\n\nHow the controversy started\n\nIn February, Mr. Zeldin announced that he had found billions of dollars of \u201cgold bars\u201d of grant funding at Citibank, calling the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (or \u201cgreen bank\u201d) grant program a \u201cscheme\u201d and a \u201crush job with no oversight.\u201d\n\nMr. Zeldin has embraced the Trump administration\u2019s emphasis on spending cuts, touting his work with the Department of Government Efficiency. He has canceled scores of other E.P.A. contracts, totaling what the agency said is around $2 billion across more than 400 initiatives.\n\nThe \u201cgold bars\u201d comment was a reference to a video released in December by Project Veritas in which Brent Efron, then an E.P.A. employee, likened his agency\u2019s efforts to spend federal funds on climate programs before leaving office to throwing \u201cgold bars\u201d off the Titanic.\n\nMr. Efron\u2019s lawyer has denied his client was referring to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.\n\nAfter Mr. Zeldin\u2019s statement, Ed Martin, the interim U.S. attorney for Washington D.C., asked Denise Cheung, a top federal prosecutor, to freeze the $20 billion held by Citibank. But she abruptly resigned after determining there was not enough evidence to order the funds frozen. The F.B.I. and the Justice Department continued their investigations.\n\nLast week, Mr. Zeldin also referred the matter to his agency\u2019s acting inspector general for a third, concurrent investigation.\n\nThe nonprofit grant recipients began executing their legal defense this past weekend, when Climate United sued E.P.A. and Citibank, claiming they were illegally withholding the money. Two other recipients filed suits against Citibank in the following days.\n\nA hearing on Climate United\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order to release the funds was scheduled for Wednesday in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.\n\nWhat the nonprofits are saying\n\nThe cancellations surprised Climate United, a nonprofit organization that was awarded nearly $7 billion, said Beth Bafford, the group\u2019s chief executive officer. She said she received an official termination letter a half-hour before the agency issued a public statement.\n\nThe nonprofits have been unable to access the funds in their Citibank accounts since mid-February. The funds have been held there under an agreement between the E.P.A. and the bank.\n\nWithout the promised funds, some groups said they are struggling to pay staff.\n\nIn a termination letter viewed by The New York Times, the E.P.A. said it had identified \u201cmaterial deficiencies\u201d in the program, including the absence of adequate oversight and improper or speculative allocation of funds. It did not provide any evidence.\n\nThe Coalition for Green Capital, one of the largest recipients, called the E.P.A.\u2019s decision \u201cunauthorized and unlawful,\u201d and said it was considering legal options.\n\nWhat we know about the $20 billion program\n\nThe $20 billion program was designed to offer low-cost loans to businesses and developers for climate initiatives, which include things like installing solar panels and retrofitting homes to make them more energy efficient.\n\nThe E.P.A. distributed the money to eight nonprofits, which planned to distribute the money as loans as well as grants to local \u201cgreen banks\u2019\u201d or credit unions, which would in turn make their own loans.\n\nThe idea was that the commitment of federal dollars would attract private investments to green projects.\n\nMr. Zeldin has made much of the fact that $20 billion in grant money was held at Citibank, portraying the E.P.A.\u2019s decision to use an outside financial institution as an intermediary as an attempt to subvert oversight.\n\nGrant recipients and former E.P.A. officials have disputed this characterization, and said that the agency has full visibility into transactions through the Citibank accounts for the nonprofit organizations and their sub-recipients\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how much of the $20 billion was spent before the freeze was put in place.\n\nA spokeswoman for the E.P.A. said it could not answer how much of the money has been loaned out by the nonprofits because the funds were spent under the Biden administration.\n\nCitibank did not respond to request for comment.",

        "full_text": "Dalvin Modore walked as if there were broken glass beneath his feet, stepping gingerly, his frail shoulders hunched against the anticipation of pain. His trousers had become so loose that he had to hold them up as he inched around his small farm in western Kenya.\n\nMr. Modore has tuberculosis. He is 40, a tall man whose weight has dropped to 110 pounds. He has a wracking cough and sometimes vomits blood. He fears the disease will kill him and has been desperate to be on medication to treat it.\n\nMr. Modore is one of thousands of Kenyans, and hundreds of thousands of people worldwide, with TB who have lost access to treatments and testing in the weeks since the Trump administration slashed foreign aid and withdrew funding for health programs around the globe.\n\nMany, like Mr. Modore, have grown significantly sicker. As they go about their lives, waiting and hoping, they are spreading the disease, to others in their own families, communities and beyond.\n\nThe whole system of finding, diagnosing and treating tuberculosis \u2014 which kills more people worldwide than any other infectious disease \u2014 has collapsed in dozens of countries across Africa and Asia since President Trump ordered the aid freeze on Jan. 20, Inauguration Day.\n\nThe United States contributed about half of international donor funding to TB last year and here in Kenya paid for an array of essentials. Trump administration officials have said that other countries should contribute a greater share to global health programs. They say the administration is evaluating foreign aid contracts to determine whether they are in the national interest of the United States.\n\nWhile some of the TB programs may ultimately survive, none have received any money for months.\n\nFamily members of infected people are not being put on preventive therapy. Infected adults are sharing rooms in crowded Nairobi tenements, and infected children are sleeping four to a bed with their siblings. Parents who took their sick children to get tested the day before Mr. Trump was inaugurated are still waiting to hear if their children have tuberculosis. And people who have the near-totally drug-resistant form of tuberculosis are not being treated.\n\nDespite being fully treatable, tuberculosis claimed 1.25 million lives in 2023, the last year for which data is available. If TB begins to spread unchecked, people throughout the world could become at risk.\n\nThe main TB research effort, testing new diagnostics and therapies, has been terminated. The global procurement agency for TB medications lost its funds, then was told it might regain them, but still has not. Stop TB, the global consortium of government and patient groups that coordinates tuberculosis tracking and treatment, was terminated, had the termination rescinded, but still has received no funds.\n\nThe United States did not pay for all the TB care in Kenya, but it funded critical pieces. And when those were frozen, it was enough to bring the entire system to a halt.\n\nThe United States paid for motorbike drivers, who earned about $1 for transporting a sample taken from a person with a presumptive infection to a lab to test it for TB. The drivers were fired on the first day of the funding cut \u2014 so the transportation of samples stopped.\n\nThe United States paid for some laboratory equipment used to process tests. In many places, processing stopped.\n\nThe United States paid for the internet connectivity that allowed many testing sites to send results back to far-off patients via local community advocates known as TB Champions. So even when patients found a way to send samples to a working lab, notification of results stopped.\n\nWithout testing that confirms whether a person is infected and what type of TB they have, family members cannot start on preventive therapy.\n\nThe United States paid for the half-dozen tests that patients need before beginning treatment for multi-drug-resistant TB, to make sure their bodies will be able to tolerate the harsh drugs. These tests can cost $80 or more, beyond the reach of many patients. Without the tests, clinicians don\u2019t know what drugs to prescribe very sick patients. Prescriptions stopped.\n\nThe United States paid for the ships and trucks that moved drugs to ports and on to warehouses and clinics. Shipments stopped.\n\nEvaline Kibuchi, the national coordinator for the Stop TB Partnership in Kenya, predicted that it would take only three months before infections and deaths from TB increased. \u201cBut we won\u2019t even know about the new deaths, because all the data collection was supported by U.S.A.I.D.,\u201d she said.\n\nThe United States also paid the stipends \u2014 about $35 a month \u2014 of community health workers, and TB Champions, who lost the tiny salaries that belie their vital role. Research has shown that because TB treatment involves taking drugs for many months, often with miserable side effects, patients are much more likely to finish a course of medication and be cured when someone is checking on them regularly, cheering them on and watching for lapses.\n\nBut across Kenya, the community advocates have kept working, unpaid, covering the costs of trying to reach patients and delivering diagnoses out of their own pockets.\n\nMr. Modore\u2019s constant cough drew neighborhood attention in January. Doreen Kikuyu, the TB Champion in his area, came and collected a sputum sample from him and used the motorbike system to send it for diagnosis.\n\nBy the time his results came back, the Trump administration had frozen the system. Ms. Kikuyu could not get funds for a motorbike to take her to his home to inform him. \u201cBut I could not leave him without knowing the answer,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I set out walking.\u201d\n\nShe also explained that the lab analysis did not provide information on whether he had a drug-resistant form, so he would need further testing before he could start the proper medication. But he would have to pay 1,000 Kenyan shillings \u2014 about $8 \u2014 to send a sample to the regional laboratory that could do this test. To pay for it, they might need to sell a chicken, one of their few assets. They debated what to do as the days ticked by.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really hoping to start on medication but I\u2019m just left wondering what will happen,\u201d Mr. Modore said one recent afternoon, sitting hunched in the shade of a stand of trees outside his house.\n\nEventually, the intrepid Ms. Kikuyu managed to scrape together the money, by gathering contributions from other now-fired community health workers and neighbors. She sent the sample to the lab. Good news came back: Mr. Modore did not have drug resistance and could take the standard medications.\n\nBut there was no one to prescribe them. The staff members at the clinic were paid by the United States, and they were now fired. Ms. Kikuyu was at her wit\u2019s end, knowing Mr. Modore was desperately ill.\n\nWorking her phone, using airtime she bought herself, she badgered a local government TB official who is a clinician to meet her at the hospital and to prescribe and issue the drugs from the shuttered clinic storeroom. She scraped together more money to bring Mr. Modore to the clinic on a motorbike. As she watched him grin and take his first pills, she felt a flood of relief.\n\nBut immediately, she faced a new worry: His family and close neighbors, about a dozen people, needed to start preventive therapy to protect them from getting sick too. The clinic is closed. If she can find a clinician to prescribe drugs for the adults, at least, she could deliver them. (TB drugs for children are complex and require a doctor\u2019s supervision.) But she\u2019s out of money to get back to the Modore home. She has worn herself out walking to the homes of other patients who are waiting for tests, waiting for results, waiting for drugs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a problem,\u201d she said wearily. \u201cBut we have to get to that family.\u201d\n\nFor TB treatment to work, patients must take their drugs every day, without interruption, for months.\n\nBarack Odima, a 38-year-old mechanic in Nairobi, has the most deadly form of the disease, one that is resistant to most treatments. Last fall he started on a rare drug combination, but when he went to pick up his medication two weeks ago, the clinic staff told him that one of the drugs had not been restocked and that they had nothing for him.\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t get this drug that is missing, how will I be cured?\u201d Mr. Odima said.\n\nAfter another week, the clinic received a small batch of medications. The clinician and the pharmacist had been laid off, so a TB Champion gave him the medication \u2014 but could not tell him how many more pills he might receive.\n\nWhile he is on the drugs, Mr. Odima is supposed to have monthly testing of his blood, liver and kidneys to make sure his body is tolerating them. That costs about $80, previously covered by the U.S. grant, and he has not had a test since the funding freeze. Mr. Odima\u2019s wife and five children are supposed to be rechecked for the disease this month; it will take all his savings to pay for X-rays.\n\nIn an interview in a clinic treatment room plastered with stickers and posters advertising U.S.A.I.D. support, Mr. Odima said he was grateful to the United States for assisting with his treatment, but was baffled that the country had cut off help. Of course his own government should provide such care, he said. \u201cBut we are a dependent country,\u201d he said, \u201cand Kenya is not able to support the programs so that all the people with these diseases can get cured.\u201d\n\nIn truth, the TB treatment system in Kenya was none too sturdy before the United States yanked its support \u2014 the country had nearly 90,000 new infections last year. Labs ran short of supplies to do molecular tests, and people were often misdiagnosed.\n\nThe TB Champions, who drop in to check in on anyone they hear about with a persistent cough, were intended as a low-budget, high-impact strategy to change that. Since the aid freeze, they have taken on outsize importance. In the scruffy western Kenyan town of Busia, a Champion named Agnes Okose is using the money she earns from her snack stall to fund trips to outlying villages. Since late January, she has been delivering diagnoses and collecting sputum samples in plastic sample jars she buys herself, toting them in a small lunch cooler to a laboratory in town.\n\nBut because all the TB and H.I.V. cases have gone to the separate clinics for years, clinicians in the main facilities don\u2019t know about drug protocols, side effects or signs of treatment failure.\n\n\u201cYou will have health care workers who have never seen a TB case; there will be quality-of-care issues,\u201d said Dr. Timothy Malika, who oversees the TB program of Kisumu County, which has one of the highest rates of TB infection in Kenya.\n\nAbigael Wanga, who lives in a village in Busia County, has five children; two have taken TB treatment for a year. But the two children, Philemon, 8, who hopes to be a pilot one day, and his headstrong sister Desma, 3, still have chest pain and coughs, and no appetite.\n\nMs. Okose fears they are drug-resistant. She collected sputum samples from them and their three siblings the day before the inauguration. The testing is frozen, and all five children continue to sleep under one blanket at night.",

        "full_text": "President Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum went into effect on Wednesday, inviting immediate retaliation from the European Union and escalating tensions with other trading partners reeling from his on-and-off approach to steep trade penalties.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s tariffs of 25 percent hit metal imports from every country that sells steel and aluminum to the United States. Many domestic steel and aluminum makers support the move, saying it will help protect their industry against foreign competitors. But the tariffs are expected to raise costs for American businesses that use foreign metals, including manufacturers of cars, canned food and drinks, solar panels and other products.\n\nSome trading partners have vowed to retaliate by issuing levies aimed at hurting U.S. exporters. Canada, a major supplier of metal in the United States, said that it would impose new retaliatory tariffs on $20 billion worth of American imports, including metals, computers and sporting goods. And the European Union swiftly announced tariffs on up to $28 billion worth of American goods, including bourbon, boats and motorcycles.\n\nThose conflicts could spiral into even bigger trade wars. Asked on Wednesday if he would retaliate against the E.U. tariffs, Mr. Trump said, \u201cOf course I will respond.\u201d\n\nMany other governments \u2014 like Japan, Australia, Mexico, Brazil and Britain \u2014 chose not to react, at least for now, for fear of worsening relations and the impact on their own economies. Those countries are also girding for the next round of Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs on April 2, when the president has said he will impose tariffs on foreign cars and countries that he says discriminate against the United States.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s recent trade moves have rocked stock markets and exacerbated concerns about the economy. Stock markets shifted between gains and losses on Wednesday as investors weighed concerns about tariffs against better-than-expected inflation data for February. Analysts have warned that Mr. Trump\u2019s sweeping plan for tariffs could push inflation higher in the future and slow the economy.\n\nOn Monday, Goldman Sachs slashed its 2025 economic growth forecasts for the United States to 1.7 percent from 2.4 percent, citing adverse trade policy.\n\n\u201cThis may be the calm C.P.I. report before the storm,\u201d said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, referring to the inflation data. She said that, with tariff policies, the inflation picture could potentially get \u201cuglier as the months go on.\u201d\n\nThe action on metals is just the latest attempt by Mr. Trump to leverage the power of tariffs and the American market against foreign governments. Last week, he issued steep tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China, blaming those countries for the entry of drugs and migrants into the United States, before quickly paring some of the tariffs back.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s approach has sent many U.S. allies into a defensive mode as they try to figure out how to mollify the president while also protecting their own industries. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump threatened to double the tariffs on Canadian metal after the province of Ontario responded to his previous tariffs by putting a surcharge on electricity exported to the United States. Within hours, Ontario had suspended its surcharge, and Mr. Trump walked back his threats.\n\nThe steel and aluminum tariffs restore and expand similar steps that Mr. Trump put in place in 2018, which ushered in several long-running trade spats. Mr. Trump argued that the tariffs were needed to protect national security and provide a reliable source of metal for the military in wartime.\n\nBut the metal tariffs mainly affect U.S. allies: Canada is by far the largest supplier of both steel and aluminum to the United States. Brazil, Mexico, South Korea and Vietnam also ship the United States significant amounts of steel, while the United Arab Emirates and China send the United States aluminum.\n\nSince Mr. Trump first issued the tariffs in 2018, both he and former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. made deals with foreign countries, including Brazil, Mexico, Canada and the European Union, that whittled away at the tariffs. The U.S. metals industry has complained that the measures were no longer strong enough to keep steel mills and aluminum smelters afloat.\n\nU.S. Steel, one of the country\u2019s sole surviving makers of primary steel, has warned that it will need to shut down plants and lay off workers unless it finds a more deep-pocketed acquirer. The chief executive of Cleveland Cliffs, the country\u2019s other primary steel maker, said that last year had been \u201cthe worst year for domestic steel demand\u201d in over a decade.\n\n\u201cThings would be, without those tariffs, much worse for the industry,\u201d said Kevin Dempsey, the president of the American Iron and Steel Institute, an industry group.\n\nBecause steel and aluminum are used to make so many other products, however, tariffs that raise the price of the metals have consequences for many other manufacturers, and for the U.S. economy.\n\nBy increasing costs of basic inputs for many companies, the tariffs could harm factories that ultimately employ far more Americans than steel mills and aluminum smelters do. Economists say that could potentially backfire on Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to bolster U.S. manufacturing.\n\nThe study found that the metal tariffs levied in 2018 encouraged buyers of steel and aluminum to purchase more from U.S. sources, led to higher domestic prices for metals and expanded U.S. steel production by about 2 percent between 2018 and 2021, the years the report studied.\n\nBut the analysis also found that the tariffs raised production costs for firms making automobiles, tools and industrial machinery, shrinking production in those and other downstream industries by about $3.48 billion in 2021. The steel and aluminum industries produced about $2.25 billion more in metals that year because of the levies.\n\nIn an effort to mitigate the harmful consequences on other industries that use steel and aluminum, the Trump administration has expanded its steel and aluminum tariffs this time to also protect various downstream goods, or \u201cderivative products\u201d made with metal, such as tractor parts, metal furniture and hinges.\n\nChad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a research organization, said that move was an \u201cimplicit acknowledgment\u201d that some industries were suffering because of Mr. Trump\u2019s previous tariffs.\n\nHe said that the tariffs created a \u201ccycle of cascading protectionism\u201d in which more industries would ask for government safeguards, and that it \u201cmay be difficult to stop\u201d once it gets going.\n\n\u201cWhere does it end?\u201d Mr. Bown asked.\n\nThe prospect of higher costs has also encouraged other U.S. industries, like automakers, to lobby for tariffs on their foreign competitors to protect their businesses. Mr. Trump has said he plans to levy a tariff on foreign cars on April 2.\n\nFor automakers, the metal tariffs threaten to raise costs when prices of new cars and trucks are already near record highs. The average price of a new vehicle in January was more than $48,000, according to Edmunds, a market research group.\n\n\u201cAffordability is already a major concern for American car shoppers amid elevated prices and interest rates,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds.\n\nRobert Budway, the president of the Can Manufacturers Institute, a trade group that represents companies making cans for food, soda, beer and paint, said that tariffs would result in higher packaging costs, which would ultimately be passed to American consumers.\n\nSince Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on steel in his first term, food packagers have been relying more on imported metals, and simply paying more for them, Mr. Budway said.\n\n\u201cIt just makes the price higher,\u201d Mr. Budway said.\n\nMajor American export industries, particularly farmers, will also be hit by retaliatory tariffs on billions of dollars of American exporters, including poultry, beef, pork and soybeans.\n\nCanadian officials said Wednesday that their retaliation would come in addition to a 25 percent tariff their government put on $30 billion of American goods this month in response to Mr. Trump\u2019s prior levies.\n\nGabriel Brunet, a spokesman for the finance minister, Dominic LeBlanc, who is leading Canada\u2019s trade response, said Canada was \u201cready to respond firmly and proportionately\u201d to any U.S. tariffs.\n\nBritain\u2019s trade secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, called the tariffs \u201cdisappointing.\u201d The country was investigating steps to protect local producers and negotiating an agreement with the United States to eliminate additional measures, he said on Wednesday.\n\nBut Maros Sefcovic, the trade commissioner for the European Union, said during a news briefing Monday that the U.S. administration \u201cdoes not seem to be engaging to make a deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the end, as it is said, one hand cannot clap,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump officials have implied that, at least for the metal tariffs, deal making is not on the table. Asked what it would take to remove steel and aluminum tariffs, Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, said Wednesday that Mr. Trump views metals as \u201cfundamental for our national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president wants steel and aluminum in America. And let me be clear, nothing\u2019s going to stop that until we\u2019ve got a big, strong domestic steel and aluminum capability,\u201d he said.\n\nReporting was contributed by Neal E.

        "full_text": "House Republicans hunting for ways to pay for President Trump\u2019s tax cuts have called for cutting the federal government\u2019s share of Medicaid spending, including a proposal that would effectively gut the Affordable Care Act\u2019s 2014 expansion of the program.\n\nCutting Medicaid spending, which is expected to be central to fulfilling the budget plan that House Republicans adopted Tuesday night, could result in millions of Americans across the country losing health coverage unless states decide to play a bigger role in its funding.\n\nFederal and state governments share the costs of Medicaid, which is a public health insurance program largely for low-income people.\n\nRepublicans are considering lowering the 90 percent share that the federal government is required to pay to states that enroll participants in the expansion. The change could generate $560 billion in savings over a decade, money that Republicans want to use toward extending Mr. Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts, which are set to expire at the end of 2025. Extending the tax cuts is expected to cost $4.5 trillion, meaning Republicans will have to find savings beyond Medicaid from a long menu of options.\n\nA move to lower federal spending on the Medicaid expansion population could effectively gut the program. Around 10 states that have expanded their programs have so-called trigger laws that reverse the Medicaid expansion if the federal government decreases funding for the population.\n\nThe change could leave the 40 states that participate in the Obamacare program with a difficult set of choices. They could shoulder the extra costs to preserve Medicaid coverage for millions, make cuts to coverage or look for cuts from other large government programs to offset the reduction in federal funds.\n\nMedicaid, which covers more than 70 million people, is the largest health insurance program in the nation, and the largest single source of funding for states. More than 21 million adults who were not eligible for Medicaid under pre-expansion guidelines received coverage last year. The program had previously restricted enrollment primarily to those who were pregnant, disabled or elderly.\n\nAmong those who qualified for Medicaid under the expansion was Jeannie Brown, a 60-year-old part-time bus driver for the public school system in Belgrade, Mont. Ms. Brown went more than five years without health insurance beginning in 2009, avoiding medical care as her health deteriorated and she cared for her disabled granddaughter.\n\nMs. Brown, who makes around $25,000 each year, had been trapped in the so-called coverage gap, with a salary too high for Medicaid, and too low for a heavily subsidized Obamacare plan.\n\nAfter Montana lawmakers voted in 2015 to take up the Affordable Care Act\u2019s option to expand Medicaid to cover more adults, Ms. Brown enrolled. She began to see a primary care doctor, and Medicaid paid for hand surgeries, knee replacements, a double mastectomy and her inhaler, she said.\n\n\u201cBeing a caregiver is extremely exhausting, especially with someone who has a lot of health needs,\u201d she said last week from a children\u2019s hospital in Colorado, where her granddaughter had been flown for emergency care. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have the preventative care I needed, I\u2019d be in a much worse place physically. I\u2019d probably be disabled.\u201d\n\nConservative critics of Medicaid expansion have argued that it forces the federal government to spend exorbitantly, and disproportionately, to cover health services for a population Medicaid was not intended to serve.\n\n\u201cThe higher federal match for able-bodied adults creates perverse incentives to divert funds from more vulnerable populations,\u201d said Michael Cannon, the director of health policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.\n\nRepublicans have also pointed to what they say is unanticipated runaway Medicaid spending. Some states have seen unexpected surges in Medicaid costs in recent years, in part because many Americans delayed care during the coronavirus pandemic. Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, recently proposed a $2.5 billion increase in state spending on the program.\n\nThe move to pare back the federal government\u2019s financial commitments to Medicaid could profoundly reshape how it shares responsibility with states to offer health care to some of the poorest Americans, as well as the providers and nursing homes that care for them.\n\nThe change would amount to a \u201cmassive transfer of the financial responsibility from the federal government to states,\u201d said Daniel Tsai, who oversaw Medicaid under former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d have states having enormous budget holes making decisions between how to do the right thing to keep people covered\u201d and how to preserve other programs, he said. \u201cStates are going to be cash strapped.\u201d\n\nMedicaid expansion has become a deeply bipartisan project over the past decade, underscoring the Affordable Care Act\u2019s reach in the American health system and its appeal even to Republican governors and state lawmakers who once opposed it. Much of the additional enrollment comes from Republican-led states where voters passed ballot initiatives to enact the program.\n\nMedicaid now funds almost half of all births in the United States, and represents more than half of spending on long-term care. More than 70 percent of Americans say they want Medicaid to stay as it is, according to a survey conducted last year by KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group.\n\nSenator Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told HuffPost last week that he had filed an amendment to a Senate budget resolution prohibiting cuts from Medicaid. After his state expanded the program in 2021, more than 300,000 low-income residents joined the rolls.\n\nRepresentative Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican, said on Sunday that lawmakers may focus on imposing a national work requirement on Medicaid, a controversial proposal that would amount to only a fraction of the cuts congressional Republicans are seeking. Ohio recently asked the Trump administration for permission to test out the policy.\n\nJon Tester, the former Democratic senator from Montana, said that Medicaid cuts could have a more sweeping effect on rural America than urban areas because of how the program sustains impoverished areas with few health providers. \u201cAnd that\u2019s an interesting conundrum because most of rural America is a much deeper red than urban America,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf you take away health care, you can\u2019t live there,\u201d Mr. Tester said.\n\nRepublicans are also considering limiting how much the federal government spends on a state\u2019s Medicaid program, a practice known as block granting or per capita caps. That strategy could save as much as $900 billion over a decade.\n\nIf states picked up the costs from the federal government and kept their expansion populations in place, they would spend more than $600 billion to do so over a decade, an increase of almost 20 percent, according to KFF. Many states would be short more than $10 billion over a decade, and some larger states, such as New York and California, would face a shortfall of more than $50 billion.\n\nWith Montana\u2019s expansion program set to expire in June, a group of state lawmakers there advanced legislation last week that would extend the program, in part to keep health providers in the heavily rural state solvent. Roughly 80,000 people in the state now have coverage through the state\u2019s expansion, drastically lowering the state\u2019s uninsured rate.\n\nBut like in other states, Montana\u2019s Medicaid expansion has been preserved in part because of strong Republican support in the state Legislature. One Republican state senator in favor of Medicaid expansion, Russ Tempel, said that it had increased behavioral health services in the state and was keeping the few hospitals in his rural district afloat.\n\nMatt Regier, the Republican president of the Montana Senate, said that hospitals in the state had become too reliant on Medicaid, and that its expansion was \u201cincentivizing people to not stand on their own two feet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the opposite of what a government safety net should be,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Illinois, another state with a trigger law, roughly a quarter of the state\u2019s Medicaid program is part of the expansion population, and the state\u2019s uninsured rate dropped by 44 percent after the expansion took effect, said Alex Gough, a spokesman for Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat. The state receives more than $7 billion for that group, Mr. Gough added.\n\n\u201cThreats to coverage would spell catastrophe,\u201d he said. He added that eliminating the Medicaid expansion \u201cwould cause major disruption to the state\u2019s health care infrastructure that relies on Medicaid funding and, ultimately, its economy.\u201d\n\nDemocratic legislators in Virginia are trying to protect Medicaid by getting rid of the trigger provision. State officials are also girding for a new wave of enrollment from laid-off federal workers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not confident Virginia would be able to provide full coverage\u201d with drastically lower federal funding, said Ghazala Hashmi, a Democratic state senator who has proposed a new committee to study the issue. \u201cThat is not a burden a state budget could bear.\u201d",

        "full_text": "When President Trump threatened tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China in January, saying those countries needed to do more to stop the flow of drugs and migrants into the United States, Canadian and Mexican officials raced to Washington, bearing charts and videos detailing their efforts to toughen their borders.\n\nCanada created a \u201cfentanyl czar\u201d and committed fresh resources to combating organized crime, while Mexico dispatched troops to the border and delivered cartel operatives into U.S. custody. As a result, Mr. Trump paused tariffs on America\u2019s North American neighbors for 30 days.\n\nChina never made these kinds of overtures and, in Mr. Trump\u2019s view, did not take any big moves to stop the flow of fentanyl into the United States. So on Feb. 4, Mr. Trump moved forward with imposing a 10 percent tariff on all Chinese imports. Last week, the president said that on March 4 he would add another 10 percent on top of all existing Chinese tariffs.\n\nMr. Trump is moving quickly to transform the U.S.-China trade relationship. The Chinese are moving much more cautiously and deliberately as they try to assess Mr. Trump and determine what it is he actually wants from China. Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have held calls with their Chinese counterparts. But a call between Mr. Trump and Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader, has failed to materialize.\n\nThe situation underscores the quandary for foreign leaders in dealing with a president as unpredictable and unconventional as Mr. Trump, who is making substantial changes to trade terms with little advance notice or preparation.\n\nThe Chinese do not want to initiate a conversation because they do not want to be seen as pleading, and are wary of offering concessions before they understand the parameters of the debate, people familiar with the discussions said. Instead, Chinese officials, academics and others close to the government have been holding discreet conversations to try to determine Mr. Trump\u2019s motives, while floating various aspects of a potential trade deal between the countries to assess the Americans\u2019 reaction.\n\n\u201cWith my experience with the Chinese, they are suspicious in the initial rounds of a negotiation that there are hidden traps or other reasons to be cautious,\u201d said Michael Pillsbury, a China expert who advises the Trump administration on dealing with the country.\n\nThe Chinese side has conveyed they would like to work with the United States on mutually beneficial measures. But they have been struggling to identify people in the United States that they see as reliable channels for communication, according to a person close to the Chinese government.\n\nThey are also trying to assess the significance of some recent steps by the administration, like a memorandum that proposed strict limits on investment between the countries. Mr. Trump publicly contradicted that memo days after he signed it, saying he welcomed Chinese investment.\n\n\u201cI think the Chinese are in a wait and listen mode,\u201d said Myron Brilliant, who has spent years working with businesses to understand the Chinese and recently returned from a trip to China. \u201cThey\u2019re taking in all kinds of input, they\u2019re beginning their consultations, they\u2019re not pushing the panic button just yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a willingness, an appetite to do a deal with the Trump administration, but China doesn\u2019t want preconditions on that, and seeks more clarity on the parameters of a deal,\u201d said Mr. Brilliant, a senior counselor at DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group, an advisory firm.\n\nThey called for treating China as an equal partner and criticized past measures taken by the Biden administration to \u201ccontain\u201d China, like export controls. The delegation also threatened that, if further U.S. tariffs went into effect, China could withdraw a law enforcement package that it had put together to combat the fentanyl trade, which included information that could be used to prosecute Chinese companies, one of the people said. They acknowledged that the Chinese economy was struggling and that more tariffs could hurt it.\n\nCurrent and former advisers and others familiar with Mr. Trump\u2019s thinking say he has expressed interest in striking a wide-ranging deal with Mr. Xi, which could involve Chinese purchases and investment, as well as cooperation on issues like nuclear security.\n\nBut Mr. Trump also believes that China reneged on the deal he signed with it in 2020 by not purchasing enough products. Mr. Trump also has no aversion to ramping up the pressure on Beijing by imposing tariffs, seeing them as a source of leverage in negotiations.\n\nMr. Trump has said he has a great relationship with Mr. Xi and would like the Chinese to invest in the United States. When asked in February if he would do a trade deal with China, Mr. Trump responded, \u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nIn an interview on \u2019 Sunday Morning Futures, Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, said that instead of stopping the manufacturing of fentanyl, the Chinese were giving \u201cthe maximum subsidy\u201d to people making the ingredients.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese need to stop this murder of Americans,\u201d he said.\n\nThe tariffs that Mr. Trump has threatened to impose on China since coming into office are already roughly comparable to those he imposed during his first administration, said Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. In 2018, Mr. Trump put tariffs ranging from 7.5 to 25 percent on more than $350 billion of Chinese imports, levies that remain in effect.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still early days,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said. \u201cThis should be seen as the floor of what\u2019s imposed, not the ceiling.\u201d\n\nBeijing has so far been cautious in retaliating, answering Mr. Trump\u2019s first volley of tariffs with a more limited number of its own. But it has signaled that it is willing to go further, possibly using its dominance in the global supply chain to exact pain.\n\nThe Chinese delegation that included Mr. Cui had come to New York as China\u2019s top diplomat, Wang Yi, visited the United Nations. While Mr. Wang did not continue on to Washington, according to one source, the Chinese embassy helped to arrange meetings for Mr. Cui in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nSenior Communist Party officials including Fang Xinghai, the former deputy chief of China\u2019s markets regulator, and the economist Zhu Min, also traveled to Washington and met with some members of the think tank community and government.\n\nThe Chinese appear to be exploring the best points of contact for their government. In the previous Trump administration, the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, served as an important go-between, as did private sector figures. Recently, the Chinese have been probing the role that Elon Musk \u2014 who has extensive business interests in China through Tesla \u2014 will play in the Trump administration.\n\nPrivately, the Chinese have indicated a willingness to start negotiating a deal but want to know that they have direct access to Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cThere seems to be a sense that Beijing is blaming what has happened on the poor communication channels,\u201d said Yun Sun, the director of the China program at the Stimson Center, a research group in Washington.",

District courts that fall under the purview of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, known for its liberal rulings, are one example of a common target destination for liberal advocacy groups and Democratic attorneys general.\n\nAlso on Thursday, U.S. District Judge William Alsup, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton in California, issued a sweeping order requiring six federal agencies to reinstate immediately thousands of probationary employees fired by the administration last month. When the administration appeals, it will move to the 9th Circuit for review. The lawsuit is backed by the State Democracy Defenders Fund, a left-leaning group headed by Norm Eisen, a staunch Trump critic and Democrat.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt criticized Alsup\u2019s decision in a statement Thursday, saying, \u201cThe President has the authority to exercise the power of the entire executive branch \u2014 singular district court judges cannot abuse the power of the entire judiciary to thwart the President\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\nConservative litigants have also engaged in similar tactics in the past. In 2023, Texas-based U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee, ruled in favor of anti-abortion activists seeking to ban the abortion pill mifepristone, a move that enraged abortion-rights advocates and led to similar left-wing complaints about forum shopping. However, the Supreme Court eventually unwound the decision, finding plaintiffs lacked standing to sue, after the conservative-leaning 5th Circuit partially upheld Kacsmaryk\u2019s original decision.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee, warned in 2020 that nationwide injunctions create an \u201casymmetric\u201d legal battlefield in which any policy can be halted by one judge, even if others would uphold it.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, expressed similar frustration last week after the Supreme Court declined to block a single district court judge\u2019s order forcing the Trump administration to pay $2 billion in foreign aid.\n\n\u201cDoes a single district-court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the Government of the United States to pay out (and probably lose forever) 2 billion taxpayer dollars?\u201d Alito wrote in a scathing dissent, calling the majority\u2019s decision \u201cstunning.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s recent nationwide setback over DEI\n\nAdding to the frustration, a recent ruling by U.S. District Judge Adam B. Abelson, an appointee of Trump\u2019s predecessor Joe Biden, further illustrates the stakes of judges heavily using nationwide injunctions.\n\nIn a challenge to Trump\u2019s executive orders (EO 14151 and EO 14173), Abelson on March 11 expanded his preliminary injunction blocking the anti-diversity, equity, and inclusion policies across all federal agencies \u2014 not just the ones named in the lawsuit.\n\nSupreme Court has a chance to address this problem\n\nThe Supreme Court faces a chance to rein in nationwide injunctions later this year. In Garland v. Texas Top Cop Shop, justices may decide whether lower courts have overstepped their authority in halting federal policies.\n\nThe case centers on a Texas judge, Amos Mazzant, an appointee of former President Barack Obama who ruled that a federal law requiring businesses to disclose ownership information was unconstitutional. But Mazzant went further \u2014 he issued a nationwide injunction preventing the government from enforcing the law at all.\n\nJust before Trump took office, the Biden administration urged the Supreme Court to reexamine Mazzant\u2019s decision. While the merits of the case involve the Corporate Transparency Act, an anti-money-laundering law, experts say an outcome in which the CTA is upheld could result in advising trial judges to issue more targeted orders that apply solely to the plaintiffs involved.\n\nThe push for legislative reform\n\nIn a statement echoing Alito\u2019s concerns, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told the the ability for a single district judge to \u201cunilaterally micromanage the executive branch should raise eyebrows.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth parties have raised serious questions about district courts\u2019 use of temporary restraining orders and universal injunctions to issue sweeping, nationwide policy mandates, and I think Congress ought to closely examine the issue,\u201d Grassley added.\n\nRobertson, the law professor, told the an easy solution could in the hands of Congress, such as with legislation requiring three-judge panels for plaintiffs in district court who are seeking nationwide injunctions.\n\n\u201cI think part of the issue is actually driven by the congressional gridlock we\u2019ve seen on policy issues for the last 20 years,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cThat has really pushed both Democratic and Republican administrations to do more by executive order and through administrative actions.\u201d\n\nRobertson\u2019s proposal would mandate that cases involving nationwide injunctions be heard by a panel of two district judges and one appellate judge from the same circuit. The goal is to reduce the influence of outlier judges and make it harder for plaintiffs to pick judges in district courts that may be more prone to favor them.\n\nFor example, the Fort Worth Division has two conservative judges, making it a prime venue for right-wing challenges to Democratic policies. In contrast, Portland, part of the District of Oregon, has six judges across multiple divisions, and its liberal-leaning judiciary makes it a favored venue for left-wing lawsuits against Republican policies.\n\n\u201cWhen a single judge can grant a nationwide preliminary injunction, it makes it easier for parties to identify the very few outlier judges who do rule more predictably,\u201d Robertson said. A similar legislative approach has been floated by Article III Project founder Mike Davis, a staunch ally of Trump.\n\nBoth Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), a ranking member of the committee, and Grassley have raised issues with nationwide injunctions and judge shopping. In April 2024, Durbin received calls from progressive groups urging him to use his oversight authority to address the issue.\n\nGrassley told the that he hopes \u201cto explore the topic further through a future hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee,\u201d and said he was \u201cactively working towards a legislative solution.\u201d\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nTRUMP BATTLES \u2018FORUM SHOPPING\u2019 AMID LIBERAL LAWSUIT SURGE\n\nLegislative efforts remain uncertain. While proposals from both Robertson and Davis signal a possible fix to the bipartisan concern, past attempts, such as a Senate Democratic bill that would have randomly assigned cases, have stalled in Congress.\n\nAs Trump now faces over 100 lawsuits against his executive agenda, the fight over judicial power is far from over.",

        "full_text": "\u201cWe have a serious problem in this country, which is that the American Bar Association, our major university law schools, and our major law firms have become an instrument of the hard Left,\u201d deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said in a recent television interview, adding that \u201cbig law\u201d has attempted \u201cto turn law into an instrument of political repression for too many years.\u201d\n\nThe ABA, established in the late 1800s, has grown into a sprawling organization that touts a membership of over 400,000 legal workers. It claims to be the \u201cnational voice of the legal profession,\u201d weighing in on nominations of federal judges, engaging in litigation, and influencing hiring processes in other areas of the legal industry. A siloed-off part of the ABA handles law school accreditation, setting standards for universities and sparking controversies when those standards wade into political territory.\n\nSen. Mike Lee (R-UT), an outspoken legal voice in Congress, blasted the ABA this week as a \u201cradical left-wing advocacy group.\u201d Lee joined a handful of his Republican colleagues in writing a letter to the ABA\u2019s president condemning the organization for embracing \u201cwoke initiatives,\u201d including its heavy use of diversity, equity, and inclusion in many facets of its work.\n\nJudicial nominees\n\nThe Republicans, most of whom are on the panel that vets judicial nominations, said they would no longer consider the ABA\u2019s ratings of prospective judges, which they said functioned as mere \u201cendorsements\u201d for Democratic-aligned nominees. Since the Eisenhower administration, the ABA has typically been given a heads-up on candidates for the federal bench and evaluated them as unqualified, qualified, or well qualified.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have boasted in the past about the ABA\u2019s positive evaluations of their preferred candidates, such as Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, who received the highest rating the organization gives. But numerous conservative appointees have also received negative or mixed evaluations.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s grievances with the ABA date back decades. The George W. Bush administration ended the practice of giving the ABA a first look at nominees, setting off a pattern in which Democratic administrations brought the practice back and the first Trump administration halted it again. The ABA has maintained that it will rate the nominees regardless of whether it is given early access to them.\n\nThe Republican senators called on Trump to stop referring to the ABA for the nomination process again \u2014 and if the past is any indication, Trump may be receptive to their request.\n\n\u2018Alienation of many conservatives\u2019\n\nRight-of-center lawyers, such as George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, have said the ABA\u2019s membership is diminished despite the organization still doing \u201cmany admirable things.\u201d\n\n\u201cPart of that decline may reflect the ideological bias of the organization,\u201d Turley told the . \u201cThe ABA once eschewed taking positions on political or ideological issues. It now regularly weighs in on such issues and is viewed as an overwhelmingly liberal organization.\u201d\n\nThe ABA promotes Democratic-aligned viewpoints, such as \u201cLGBTQ+\u201d initiatives, support for abortion access, and DEI.\n\n\u201cThere are good-faith disagreements over constitutional interpretations, but the ABA often speaks for the members on adopting positions with its largely liberal leadership,\u201d Turley said. \u201cThe result has been the alienation of many conservative, libertarian, and moderate lawyers.\u201d\n\nSouth Texas College law professor Josh Blackman has frequently made similar observations and has urged the ABA to elevate members to its internal committees who span the ideological spectrum.\n\n\u201cAs the ABA drifts further and further away from the regulation of the legal profession, and focuses more and more on achieving progressive societal goals, the organization\u2019s mandate dissolves,\u201d Blackman warned in 2023.\n\nTrump administration\n\nTrump\u2019s recently confirmed attorney general, Pam Bondi, has also taken aim at the ABA.\n\nBondi wrote a warning letter last month to its Council of the Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar, a powerful part of the ABA that operates independently of the rest of the organization and is the sole body to dole out law school accreditations.\n\nThe council has \u201cfor years\u201d imposed \u201cunlawful race and sex discrimination\u201d on law students and staff \u201cunder the guise of \u2018diversity\u2019 mandates,\u201d Bondi said. She said that while she was glad the section\u2019s Standard 206, which requires schools\u2019 \u201ccommitment to diversity,\u201d had recently been suspended, it should be repealed entirely.\n\nMore broadly, the Trump administration is seeking out entities in the legal industry with Democratic ties, a move that comes as Trump has torn into lawyers working to help his political enemies or hinder his efforts to reshape rapidly and slim down the federal government through mass firings, abrupt contract terminations, and spending freezes.\n\nTrump signed executive orders stripping two major law firms of security clearances, Perkins Coie, which aided former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, and Covington & Burling, which Politico reported has been helping former Trump prosecutor Jack Smith. Individual lawyers have also drawn Trump\u2019s wrath and been told they have lost security clearances, including prominent Democratic lawyer Norm Eisen and longtime lawyer Mark Zaid, who has represented clients in national security lawsuits across the political spectrum for years. Some of the lawyers and firms on Trump\u2019s target list have already signaled they are pushing back on the president through lawsuits.\n\nTrump himself has not directly addressed the ABA\u2019s role in judicial nominees, but the organization\u2019s statement last week signaled it is displeased with the new administration.\n\nThe ABA\u2019s president wrote that he is seeing from the Trump administration \u201cwide-scale affronts to the rule of law itself, such as attacks on constitutionally protected birthright citizenship, the dismantling of USAID and the attempts to criminalize those who support lawful programs to eliminate bias and enhance diversity.\u201d\n\nTRUMP SUSPENDS SECURITY CLEARANCES FOR LAWYERS WHO AIDED JACK SMITH\n\nWhen asked for comment on Republicans\u2019 criticisms of the ABA, an organization spokesman pointed to the ABA accreditation council\u2019s letter responding to Bondi.\n\nIn it, the council said its controversial Standard 206 \u201chas been suspended and is not being enforced.\u201d The council also reiterated that the section of the ABA that deals with accreditation is walled off from the rest of the ABA. The ABA has not responded to the GOP senators.",

        "full_text": "The eventual ruling in the case, Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services, could determine whether so-called reverse discrimination claims should be evaluated under the same standards as those brought by historically marginalized groups.\n\nWhat is the legal issue before the Supreme Court?\n\nAt the heart of the case is the \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d rule, a legal test used by some federal courts when majority-group plaintiffs, such as white or straight employees, bring discrimination claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This rule requires these plaintiffs to prove that their employer is \u201cthat unusual employer who discriminates against the majority.\u201d\n\nMarlean Ames, a former Ohio Department of Youth Services employee and plaintiff in the case, argues that the rule makes it significantly harder for white and straight workers to bring discrimination lawsuits. Ames claims she was passed over for a promotion and later demoted in favor of less-qualified gay employees, a complaint that was rejected by two lower courts beneath the highest.\n\nAmes sued in the Southern District of Ohio, but her case was dismissed for failing to meet the background circumstances rule. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal, acknowledging her discrimination claim was plausible since she was demoted and replaced by gay employees but ruling that she failed to meet the extra burden required for majority-group plaintiffs.\n\nHowever, several other circuit courts have chosen not to apply the background circumstances rule in discrimination cases, creating a split beckoning the nine justices to bring clarity to the issue. The Supreme Court is now set to resolve a circuit split on whether the background circumstances rule should remain in place during an oral argument hearing at 10 a.m. local time.\n\nHow does this case relate to the Supreme Court\u2019s recent rulings on discrimination?\n\nThe case marks another major fight over discrimination since the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark 2023 ruling in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard/UNC, which struck down race-based affirmative action in college admissions as a violation of the 14th Amendment\u2019s equal protection clause.\n\nThat decision held that eliminating discrimination means eliminating it entirely, a principle Ames and her supporters argue should apply equally to employment law.\n\nThe Equal Protection Project, led by Legal Insurrection founder William Jacobson, argues in an amicus brief that \u201creverse discrimination is no longer unusual; it is unfortunately alive and well.\u201d\n\nThe brief states that discrimination against white and straight employees has become \u201cubiquitous,\u201d particularly under corporate DEI initiatives, and that they should not be subject to a higher legal burden.\n\nWhat are the arguments supporting Ames?\n\nAmes and her supporters argue that the background circumstances rule unfairly places a higher burden on majority-group plaintiffs, making it harder for them to challenge workplace discrimination.\n\nAmerica First Legal, which has filed numerous lawsuits against DEI policies, argues that \u201cnothing in Title VII supports a higher burden for \u2018majority\u2019 employees who claim discrimination.\u201d\n\nWhat are the arguments against Ames?\n\nThe Ohio Department of Youth Services defends the background circumstances test as a necessary tool for evaluating discrimination claims fairly. The department warns that eliminating this requirement could open the floodgates to lawsuits challenging diversity policies and complicate efforts to enforce employment laws.\n\nIn December, former Biden administration Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar led an amicus brief in support of the department, arguing, \u201cThe district court did not apply the \u2018background circumstances\u2019 requirement to Ames\u2019s claim that she was demoted because she is a woman.\u201d\n\nA coalition of civil rights organizations, including the NAACP, argues that courts must consider the history of systemic inequality in employment discrimination cases. \u201cMajority-group plaintiffs cannot rely on the same legacy of discrimination to support their claims,\u201d their amicus brief states. The NAACP contends that eliminating the background circumstances rule could make it harder to address long-standing disparities in hiring and promotion.\n\nWhat stands to change if Ames wins?\n\nA ruling in favor of Ames could make it significantly easier for nonminority employees to bring viable discrimination complaints against employers, depending on the circumstances of their claims.\n\nAPPLE SHAREHOLDERS REJECT OVERHAULING DEI PROGRAM\u2019S \u2018ILLEGAL DISCRIMINATION\u2019\n\nIn turn, a favorable ruling for Ames could reshape workplace diversity initiatives and make DEI policies more legally vulnerable, as conservative groups saw as a logical next step with the undoing of affirmative action for college admissions two years ago.\n\nWith the Supreme Court\u2019s Republican-appointed majority having already dismantled affirmative action in college admissions, Ames v. Ohio could become another defining decision in the legal battles over race, gender, and workplace discrimination.",

        "full_text": "It\u2019s one of the most important debates taking place among Democrats after they lost the White House and the Senate last year. Their House majority was wiped away in the 2022 midterm elections. Democrats also suffered only their second national popular vote loss at the presidential level since 1988.\n\nTypically, the party out of power splits between forces that want to pivot back to the center, correcting mistakes that cost it the previous election, and those that think it is important to draw a stronger ideological contrast with their opponents.\n\nThe Democrats in 2025 are no different. Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) has made rhetorical overtures to Republicans and voted with them a handful of times. And Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) jeopardized his leadership position by defying the progressive base on a government shutdown. Both have faced backlash from those on the Left who want congressional Democrats to fight the GOP agenda at all costs.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris has been criticized for being too left-wing and cautious. Her past progressive positions, especially those taken in her failed 2020 presidential campaign, cost her votes in November. But she also soft-pedaled or reversed many of those stances, seeming like a flip-flopper and potentially depressing progressive enthusiasm for her candidacy.\n\nNewsom would surely like to be the Democratic standard-bearer in 2028. Since launching his podcast, he has interviewed MAGA figures such as Steve Bannon and Charlie Kirk. The California governor has also repudiated many progressive excesses, such as biological men competing as transgender women in female sports and the term \u201cLatinx.\u201d\n\nWalz might also be looking to strike out on his own after being Harris\u2019s understudy in the 2024 campaign, especially if she doesn\u2019t run again. The Minnesotan was sure to demonstrate he remained appropriately outraged by MAGA in all its forms.\n\nWhile Newsom said he wanted \u201cto first understand what their motivations are\u201d and figure \u201cwhat they\u2019re actually doing,\u201d Walz had a simpler question for dealing with their shared political opponents: \u201cHow do we put some of those guys back under a rock?\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are bad guys, though,\u201d Walz said as Newsom explained why he had people such as Bannon and Kirk on his podcast. \u201cThese are bad guys.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you talk to a guy like Steve Bannon, he talks about working folks, and he talks about how we hollowed out the industrial core of this country,\u201d Newsom said, later adding that what Bannon says \u201creminds me a lot of what Bernie Sanders was saying, reminds me a lot of what Democrats said 20, 30 years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he denies the election!\u201d Walz shot back, referring to 2020 instead of the more recent election he and other Democrats lost.\n\nNeither Newsom nor Walz is an ideal candidate for a Democratic rebranding. Both face major authenticity problems. Walz said of Trump supporters, \u201cI do think I could kick most of their ass,\u201d a characteristically awkward formulation. Newsom would have to explain constantly changing positions no less than Harris did and defend California\u2019s dysfunction and liberalism.\n\nBut their conversation highlighted the Democrats\u2019 choices in the next two elections. They can continue to run on democracy, Jan. 6, fighting Trump, and more or less reinforcing the progressive agenda. Or they can try to adjust, both in style and substance, so they are no longer on the wrong side of public opinion on as many matters.\n\nThe third option is to wait for Trump to self-destruct. It has happened before, and it is easy to see opportunities for it to happen again.\n\nSHINING \u2018DAYLIGHT\u2019 ON HOW DEMOCRATS BLEW THE 2024 ELECTION\n\nYet, after nearly a decade in national politics, Trump is still here. He is in the Oval Office while two leading lights of the Democratic Party are arguing about his aides on a podcast having failed to \u201ckick most of their ass.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a conversation Democrats will be having a lot over the next couple of years.",

We are striving for this, a peaceful settlement that takes into account the legitimate interests of our side, our concerns are known. It seems to me that no one needs such steps that imitate peaceful actions in this situation,\u201d Ushakov added.\n\nThe announcement comes amid the quickest territorial change in the war since Ukraine\u2019s Kursk offensive in August. In an operation that sent Russian troops behind Ukrainian lines by utilizing a gas pipeline, Russian forces have begun rapidly pushing Ukrainian forces out of their salient within Russia.\n\nThe ceasefire was negotiated in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, after hours of talks. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Waltz represented the U.S., while Ukraine was represented by Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Minister of Defense Rustem Umerov, and Head of Presidential Office Andrii Yermak.\n\nIt called for an immediate, 30-day cessation of hostilities across Ukraine. During this period, the U.S. would mediate discussions on extending the ceasefire, aiming for a lasting peace.\n\nCeasefires are often viewed with skepticism in Ukraine and Russia. The Minsk I and Minsk II ceasefire agreements during the 2014-2015 Donbas War were repeatedly violated by both sides.\n\nThe rejection had been expected. The image-conscious Putin made his first public appearance since the ceasefire announcement in military fatigues, visiting military headquarters in Kursk on Wednesday. It was the first time he was pictured in military garb since the beginning of the war in Ukraine.\n\nRubio hoped the Russians would accept the ceasefire deal as a \u201cgoodwill gesture.\u201d However, the Russian military analyst Telegram channel Rybar, which has connections with the Russian Defense Ministry, derided the proposal as \u201cmocking.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with top generals Wednesday, Putin said that Ukrainian soldiers captured in Kursk would be treated as terrorists, accusing them of crimes against civilians.\n\n\u201cOur immediate goal is as soon as possible to conclusively destroy the enemy entrenched on the territory of Kursk region,\u201d the Russian president said.\n\nUkrainian and Russian news outlets reported that, facing encirclement, Ukrainian forces began withdrawing from Kursk earlier this week.\n\nUkrainian Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi appeared to admit to the withdrawal in a statement, saying that \u201cunits of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, if necessary, will maneuver to more advantageous positions.\u201d\n\nThe rapid fall of Sudzha came as a shock to many Russians as soldiers and commanders alike feared that the battle for the city would be the bloody climax of the Kursk campaign, possibly taking months. Instead, it fell in about three days. Russia declared Sudzha fully retaken on Thursday.\n\nRussian soldiers were seen brandishing the Russian, airborne, Wagner, and Russian Imperial flags in the center of Sudzha on Wednesday. Isolated pockets of Ukrainian troops are believed to be trapped in areas across the city.\n\nUS ENVOY WITKOFF TO TRAVEL TO RUSSIA THIS WEEK FOR NEGOTIATIONS\n\nWhile Ukrainian news outlets insisted on an orderly withdrawal, dozens of videos showed the chaotic retreat of Ukrainian troops and vehicles. Russian artillery, aviation, and first-person drones covered the road out of Sudzha, devastating vehicles, equipment, and soldiers.\n\nU.S. special envoy Steven Witkoff will travel to Moscow this week for high-level peace discussions with the Russians.",

Share Copy Link \u2713 Link copied to clipboard! Millions of Social Security recipients impacted by the Social Security Fairness Act will no longer have to wait up to a year for their benefits to increase, the Social Security Administration (SSA) has announced. Why It Matters Earlier this year, lawmakers passed a bill that would repeal the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO). Both of these reduced Social Security benefits for millions of workers, including teachers, firefighters, and police officers, and some federal employees. Signing the act into law, former President Joe Biden said it would permanently boost Social Security benefits for more than 2.8 million recipients, and that retroactive payments backdated to January 2024 would also be issued. But these groups were told that it could take up to a year for backdated payments and renewed benefits amounts to be administered. What To Know The WEP reduced Social Security benefits for individuals who receive pensions from public-sector jobs\u2014such as those held by state and federal employees\u2014that did not require Social Security payroll tax contributions. This reduction applied even if they contributed to Social Security through other employment and qualified for benefits. The GPO reduced spousal or survivor benefits for retired federal, state, and local government workers who did not pay into Social Security funds through their payroll taxes.

GETTY Now, the SSA has confirmed that impacted groups, consisting of some 3.2 million people, will receive a one-time retroactive payment by the end of March . Higher benefits\u2014which former President Biden said would be an average $360 a month\u2014will be administered from April onward. The SSA has said that, \"depending on factors such as the type of Social Security benefit received and the amount of the person's pension, the change in payment amount will vary from person to person.\" The federal agency added that impacted recipients \"will receive a mailed notice from Social Security explaining the benefit change or retroactive payment.\" Why Were Payments Delayed? On its website, the SSA said it was \"finalizing its plan to implement the act while limiting negative effects on our regular workloads and services to the public.\" However, the implementation of the Act is being hampered by a hiring freeze and \"ongoing staff shortages,\" the SSA said. The administration added that it expected it \"could take more than one year to adjust benefits and pay all retroactive benefits.\" What People Are Saying Lee Dudek, acting commissioner of Social Security, said in a press release issued on February 25 : \"Social Security's aggressive schedule to start issuing retroactive payments in February and increase monthly benefit payments beginning in April supports President Trump's priority to implement the Social Security Fairness Act as quickly as possible. \"The agency's original estimate of taking a year or more now will only apply to complex cases that cannot be processed by automation. The American people deserve to get their due benefits as quickly as possible.\" John Hatton, staff vice president of policy and programs at National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, told Federal News Network : \"SSA's announcement that they will begin paying benefits to those impacted by WEP and GPO this week is music to our ears. This is much quicker than previously forecast, and will have an immediate, positive impact on those who have waiting decades for this relief.\" What Happens Next With payments expected to arriving over the next two months, the SSA has urged beneficiaries to wait until April to ask about the status of their retroactive payment since these payments will be processed incrementally into March. As for increased monthly payments, new amounts will be distributed starting in April's payment, so beneficiaries should wait until after receiving it before contacting Social Security if they have any queries about their monthly benefit amount. fairness meter fairness meter is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.

Share Copy Link \u2713 Link copied to clipboard! Something is fundamentally broken in America. And you can get a hint of it in the way Americans think about and interact with news about the world. Especially news about politics. A fascinating new study from public opinion firm Change Research puts its finger on the problem: \"navigating a sea of bias, sensationalism, and misinformation exhausts and annoys significant portions of voters.\" The researchers show that it's this basic aggravation with the way we get information that is at the core of a lot of voter behavior. Americans have grown weary; not just of the news, but also of the entire miserable chore of learning about it. Which explains the stunning statistic that the share of Americans saying they closely follow news dropped 13 points in the past eight years, and that today, only one-third of us pay any real attention to the world around us. Like singles on a dating app wading through a sea of creeps, duds, and weirdos until they quiet-quit the dating pool out of sheer exasperation, people are opting out of news out of frustrated fatigue. Pedestrians walk past a newspaper vending machine as it lies next to the PNI Building, which housed the Philadelphia Inquirer in 2006 in Philadelphia. Pedestrians walk past a newspaper vending machine as it lies next to the PNI Building, which housed the Philadelphia Inquirer in 2006 in Philadelphia. William Thomas Cain/Getty Images Except that when Americans swipe left on current events, the consequences are a lot more disastrous . President Donald Trump actually won the last election only because so few voters were paying attention: voters who said they barely follow news favored him by 19 points in 2024; those who follow news \"a great deal\" favored Vice President Kamala Harris by 6. Those Americans seeing the past month of chaos , rising prices, surrender to our enemies, and the trail of death and disease that Trump has created might be screaming, like Adam Sandler in The Wedding Singer , that they wish all of this had been brought to their attention yesterday... as in, before the election. Except it was. Anyone taking even a little bit of interest knew this was coming. As voters in a republic who are supposed exercise self-determination, that's on us. Mostly. But it's also on the media. Because they're the ones who are supposed to help the citizenry make informed decisions so that we can govern ourselves. And they're the ones that have made reading news feel like jumping into the trash compactor in Star Wars : wading through muck, waiting for some cyclopean alien eel to jump out and drown you. What a wonderful smell we've discovered. Read more The Presidential Power Grab That Should Terrify Every American | Opinion With McConnell Retiring, the Old GOP Is Gone for Good | Opinion Trump's Hate for the FCPA Isn't About \"Government Efficiency\" | Opinion Is there any way out of the cesspool? It depends on whether media organizations figure out the secret. What they need to see is that the thing that is ultimately broken in America is trust. Stacks of research show that trust in institutions has been cratering and news media are among the biggest losers in the great American confidence die-off. But there are a few clever media entities that are thriving right now, and it's highly likely that a major reason is that they've recognized ways to address some of the root causes \u2014perceptions of bias, sensationalism, misinformation, and financial motivations\u2014behind people's loss of faith. For example, the Philadelphia Inquirer is tackling reader skepticism of media motivations by leaning into their not-for-profit ownership as a contrast to their competitors. They've successfully branded themselves as a paper that's more willing to shoot straight with readers because they're less driven by the balance sheet. That differentiation directly attacks one of the biggest sources of loss of reader trust\u2014the feeling that what they're reading is dripping with sensationalism. Articles look less like click-bait if the newspaper doesn't seem like it has quite the same need to chase clicks. Substack is following a different trust-based model, and it's clearly resonating . It allows subscribers to develop a direct, social media-like connection with creators, so they can feel like they are getting more unvarnished analysis with less suspicion of platform owner bias. Creators also often mix the DIY Substack vibe with the name-brand professionalism of big-name-media by straddling both worlds. The smarter media outlets have seen this as a good thing, a win-win way to build greater reader trust for themselves by tapping into the creators' direct audience connection. Both of us are becoming such straddlers, and one of us (Schecter), a former Daily Beast columnist, is literally starting his own Substack right now (feel free to come give feedback on this article in his 12-hour livestream happening today, or hit Robison's ). To be sure, this list is neither complete nor perfect, and these steps are necessary but may not be sufficient. But the take-home is clear: if news media is going to reverse the tune-out trend\u2014which is something this country desperately needs\u2014the table stakes are being much clearer about getting biases out in the open and helping people feel like they at least know what they're getting. And they can't just hope that it will happen; Walter Cronkite ain't walking through that door, so they've got to work for it... If they do, the marketplace may even reward them.

Texas Representative Dan Crenshaw and conservative commentator Tucker Carlson are again at odds after Crenshaw was caught on a hot mic making a controversial remark about Carlson on Monday. The incident has ignited anger among some viewers and sparked interest in the long-standing tensions between the two figures, who have clashed repeatedly over political issues and personal criticisms. What Did Dan Crenshaw Say About Tucker Carlson? During a recent event in Texas, Crenshaw was allegedly overheard saying, \"I'd kill that guy if I had the chance,\" referring to Carlson. The comment came after Crenshaw was interviewed by GB News reporter Steven Edginton. During the chat scheduled for broadcast, Crenshaw had criticized Carlson's stance on Ukraine . Rep.

Graeme Sloan/Sipa USA The duo moved away from the set, but their microphones remained on. Edginton asked Crenshaw: \"Have you ever met Tucker?\" He replied: \"We've talked a lot. On Twitter . If I ever meet him, I'll f****** kill him.\" Crenshaw then added: \"I'm not joking. He's the worst person.\" The comment quickly went viral and sparked widespread criticism, particularly from viewers who support Donald Trump and MAGA. Crenshaw appeared to clarify his remarks later on X, formerly Twitter. Georgia Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene tagged Crenshaw and asked if he threatened to kill Carlson. The congressman denied it, writing, \"lol, no.\" Carlson responded to the incident on X by inviting the congressman for an interview. \"Why don't you come sit for an interview and we'll see how you do? I'll send you my address,\" Carlson wrote. Who Is Dan Crenshaw? Dan Crenshaw is a U.S. representative representing Texas' 2nd congressional district. A former Navy SEAL who lost his right eye during an explosion in Afghanistan, he medically retired in September 2016 as a lieutenant commander after serving 10 years in the SEAL teams. He serves on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Committee. He married his wife Tara in 2013, and they have one daughter. Crenshaw's military service earned him respect among veterans and conservatives. His memoir, Fortitude: American Resilience in the Era of Outrage , emphasizes the importance of mental resilience. Is Dan Crenshaw A Democrat Or A Republican? Dan Crenshaw is a member of the Republican Party . First elected to Congress in 2018, he has aligned himself with traditional conservative values, advocating for a strong national defense, limited government and free-market principles.

        "full_text": "The founder of a women-only gym has found herself at the center of a social media storm\u2014with both critics and supporters\u2014after she walked-back her initial plans to include trans-female clients.\n\nNatalee Barnett, a 25-year-old fitness influencer from the U.K. with hundreds of thousands of followers across various platforms online, has been updating her \"nataleebfitness\" fans for years about her plan to open her own gym. She is currently preparing to open a venue in London called \"The Girls Spot\" catering specifically for women.\n\nFour years ago, in 2021, Barnett posted on X (formerly Twitter) to confirm that trans-women would also be welcome when she opened. However, on Sunday, she released a video statement on X saying her soon-to-open gym is now only \"for biological women.\" Her lengthy explanation, watched by more than 32 million viewers and shared more than 15,000 times, has been greeted with a mix of both fury and praise from X users.\n\n has reached out to Barnett via her Instagram page seeking further information and comment on the furor.\n\nThe episode comes amid an increasingly bitter cultural debate about the rights of transgender people in society, particularly relating to their inclusion in women's sports and women-only spaces. Trans athletes, such as the swimmer Lia Thomas, have been accused of \"stealing\" podium wins from cisgender women who have not undergone male puberty. While Thomas's competitor-turned-activist Riley Gaines has also said that women being forced to change alongside transgender athletes who have male genitalia constitutes a form of sexual abuse.\n\nPresident Donald Trump recently enshrined his stance on the debate in law, by signing an executive order barring transgender female athletes from competing in women's or girls' sporting events.\n\nThe U.K. has been riven by similar debates about the role trans athletes should play in women's sport, so Barnett's gym has now found itself in the eye of the storm.\n\nBarnett revealed on X on February 2 that her long-time goal of opening a women's gym was set to become a reality this year. She shared photos of her posing outside The Girls Spot alongside an X post from 2021 when the then-21-year-old first outlined her plans to open her own gym.\n\nHowever, another post she shared in 2021 has also received renewed attention.\n\nFour years ago, Barnett had written that, \"respectfully, if you have a problem with trans women attending my gym then you can find another gym to train at. I have discussed this several times before, trans women are women and also a minority that need to be protected. Please keep your transphobia away.\"\n\nBut in an X post this weekend, the gym owner explained that she had changed her mind about the admittance of trans-women, writing: \"Addressing my tweet from 2021. The Girls Spot operates as a female-only gym for biological women, tackling harassment, sexual assault & violence that women face inside the gym. The tweet circling was made 4 years ago and I was in the very early stages of creating a concept.\"\n\nShe also attached a video in which she spoke directly to the camera to explain her reasoning. She told viewers the gym was designed to be a safe space for women who often suffer from sexual harassment at mixed gyms.\n\nShe also said she has now had several years to work out exactly what she wants her venue to provide, saying that \"the meaning of The Girls Spot gym is now entirely different.\" She added: \"Whilst we are a gym, inside we are focusing on self defense classes, Muay Thai, boxing classes, as well as workshops and activations around PCOS [polycystic ovary syndrome] and training on your menstrual cycle, all of which occur to biological women.\"\n\nAddressing my tweet from 2021.The Girls Spot operates as a female-only gym for biological women, tackling harassment, sexual assault & violence that women face inside the gym.The tweet circling was made 4 years ago and I was in the very early stages of creating a concept. pic.twitter.com/R4i6iUCMLA\n\nLater in the video, she stressed: \"We do believe that everybody deserves a safe space and there are many gyms that are starting to have mixed cubicles in changing rooms so that individuals can feel safer and more included in these environments. But The Girls Spot gym as a standalone is a female-only gym because it is imperative that I stick to the vision and the mission and ensure that these women feel safe.\"\n\nA follow-up X post added: \"I believe trans women and other individuals deserve safe spaces too, that hasn't changed.\"\n\nBarnett's decision on the membership of her gym sparked both delight and despair among internet commentators.\n\nOne X user, whose profile said she is an \"adult human female,\" said: \"THANK YOU for standing up for biological women and girls this way. May your business thrive.\"\n\nBut another commentator, whose profile says they are \"nonbinary writer,\" said: \"I hope your gym fails honestly. How you creating a 'safe space' but excluding the most vulnerable? (sic)\"\n\nAnd others questioned how Barnett would enforce her policy and wondered who would be affected by that.\n\nOne X user, who described themselves as a 23-year-old \"fat\" person, said: \"how do you intend to police that in a way that is not incredibly invasive?\"\n\nWhile another added: \"what do the logistics ACTUALLY look like ? checking private parts at the door ??? when muscular c!s [cisgender] women who don't look 'woman enough' want to come what then ? when those women experience discrimination from other women trying to transinvestigate, what then ?? as a business woman, i'm interested to see how you imagine this working.\"\n\nBarnett has set up a pink-themed website for The Girls Spot, which is set to open in the spring. Would-be clients are invited to sign up to the waiting to list to \"become a founding member,\" where they can \"feel safe, protected, and inspired to thrive in a space built just for you.\"",

        "full_text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that Russia agrees in principle with the United States' ceasefire proposal, but key terms still need to be negotiated. He stressed that any agreement should lead to lasting peace and address the root causes of the conflict.\n\nPutin pointed out that Ukrainian troops remain encircled in their last foothold in Russia's Kursk region, and it must be determined whether they will surrender before the ceasefire takes effect.\n\nSpeaking to reporters before his meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, President Donald Trump reiterated his call for Russia to agree to a 30-day ceasefire with Ukraine.\n\n\"You don't want to waste time with a ceasefire if it's not going to mean anything. So we're saying, 'This is what you can get. This is what you can't get,'\" Trump said.\n\n\"Now we're going to see whether or not Russia is there and if they're not, it will be a very disappointing moment for the world,\" he added.\n\nLater, appearing with Rutte in the Oval Office, Trump called Putin's remarks \"promising but incomplete.\"\n\nThe ceasefire proposal, presented by U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff during negotiations in Moscow, was already accepted by Ukraine in talks held in Saudi Arabia earlier this week.\n\nThe diplomatic effort coincided with a Russian claim that its troops have driven the Ukrainian military out of a key town in Russia's Kursk border region, where Moscow has been trying for seven months to dislodge Ukrainian forces from their foothold.\n\nOn Thursday, Putin also emphasized the need to establish a mechanism to monitor potential violations of the truce and raised concerns about whether Ukraine might use the 30-day ceasefire to mobilize troops and rearm.\n\n\"We agree with the proposals to halt the fighting, but we proceed from the assumption that the ceasefire should lead to lasting peace and remove the root causes of the crisis,\" Putin said.\n\nPutin observed that while the U.S. appears to have persuaded Ukraine to accept a ceasefire, Kyiv's motivation likely stems from the battlefield situation. He pointed out that Ukrainian forces that entered the Kursk region are on the verge of being completely encircled in the coming days.\n\n\"Under these conditions, I believe it would be beneficial for Ukraine to secure a ceasefire for at least 30 days,\" he said.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, a senior Kremlin official rejected the idea of a temporary ceasefire, saying Russia was only interested in a long-term resolution of the Ukraine conflict, Russian media reported.\n\nBrian Taylor, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, told via email: \"It's important to listen carefully to what Putin is saying. He supported the idea of a ceasefire in general, but then proceeded to stress the need to address the 'root causes' of the conflict. To Putin, the 'root cause' of the conflict is Ukraine's desire to be an independent country and choose it's own path in domestic and foreign policy. Further, he pointed to 'nuances' and proceeded to ask at least sixteen questions about the details of any ceasefire agreement. Putin's answer seems carefully crafted to sound like a 'yes' to Trump but be a 'no' in practice, unless Ukraine is forced to submit to Russia's demands.\"\n\nYuri Ushakov, an aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin, told Russia-1: \"We believe that our goal is a long-term peaceful settlement. We strive for this, a peaceful settlement that takes into account the legitimate interests of our country, our well-known concerns. It seems to me that no one needs any steps that imitate peaceful actions in this situation.\"\n\nWhite House national security adviser Mike Waltz said in a statement Tuesday: \"The Ukrainian delegation today made something very clear, that they share President Trump's vision for peace, they share his determination to end the fighting, to end the killing, to end the tragic meat grinder of people.\"\n\nUkraine President Volodymir Zelensky said in a video address on Sunday: \"We hope for results, both in bringing peace closer and in continuing support.\"\n\nWitkoff is set to meet with Putin on Thursday night in Moscow.\n\n\"The meeting between Witkoff and President Vladimir Putin will take place in a closed format this evening,\" Ushakov told the Russian state-owned news outlet Izvestia.\n\nThis story includes reporting from the .\n\nUpdate 3/13/25, 12:58 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.\n\nUpdate 3/13/25, 12:22 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.\n\nUpdate 3/13/25, 1:26 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.\n\nUpdate 3/13/25, 2:03 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information and remarks by Trump.\n\nUpdate 3/13/25, 2:23 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information remarks.",

Before we get to the vice president's speech in Munich, can you clear up speculation or say something more on the reports that you are \"determined\" to enter the presidential race?\n\nVictor Ponta: Now, I can be very clear. Yes, I will run, and yes, I will be the president of Romania.\n\n Media: During the vice president\u2019s speech, he questioned the annulment of last year\u2019s Romanian election due to alleged Russian interference, implying that such actions undermine democratic resilience. Given these assertions, how do you perceive Romania\u2019s position within the broader U.S.-Europe relationship? Should Romania align more closely with U.S. perspectives on governance and free speech, or maintain its current trajectory within the European framework?\n\nVictor Ponta: Ever since we threw away the shackles of communism, Romania and its people have committed to a special partnership with the U.S. As prime minister of Romania ten years ago, I had to take strategic decisions that proved this. For example, to buy for the Romanian Airforce F16 jets, to release the first licences for shale gas and offshore gas to Chevron and Exxon. We hold the second-largest American military base on the continent.\n\nBut now, with the new administration led by President Trump, the enthusiasm of Romanians about America is even greater. The absolute majority of Romanians are sharing the values promoted by the MAGA movement: God, family, country, peace. Mr. Trump is very popular in my country.\n\nRomania will always be in Europe and a proud member of the EU, but when I\u2019m elected as president, I will advocate for more alignment with the U.S. There is no NATO without the U.S., and there is no reliable military or energetic security for the continent without the U.S. As president of Romania, I would come immediately to the Trump administration with a clear common project to make Mihail Kogalniceanu Air Base (MKAB) in Romania, the largest U.S. base in Europe, and another economic project to develop with American companies in the field of huge natural resources which are already confirmed in the Black sea and the Carpathian areas.\n\nRomanian people are disappointed by the bureaucracy and lack of transparency in Brussels, as we witnessed during the COVID pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Most of all, the shameful decision to cancel the second round of elections in our country without evidence or reasonable cause \u2013 and without any pushback from Europe. And so, besides military and economic cooperation, I strongly believe that only the U.S. can guarantee for Romania a clear and sustainable return to free speech and democratic elections. The people of Romania must have a voice and be allowed to vote for whomever they want, and I greatly welcome the new administration\u2019s firm stance on that issue.\n\n Media: Reflecting some more on last year\u2019s cancelled elections, what measures would you propose to strengthen Romania\u2019s electoral integrity? How can Romania balance the need for security with the preservation of democratic processes and public trust?\n\nVictor Ponta: The first thing we have to do is transfer the power back to the people. We have a ridiculous situation where the banning of candidates or annulling elections is completely in the hands of a few judges without any oversight or participation of parliament. The ultimate sovereign is completely shut out. When I was PM, it was different. But after I left office, it was changed into a non-transparent and undemocratic way. The system in Romania is stronger than the people\u2019s will, and this is the greatest cause of anger and distrust.\n\nThe core values of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of elections, where the people are the sovereign, have been lost, taken hostage in the last ten years by a system that serves its own interests \u2013 God forbid even foreign interests \u2013 and not the Romanian people. Only in very, very extreme cases do security interests need to outweigh democratic ones \u2013 and that principle has been lost in Romania.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI saw that system from very close when I was prime minister 10 years ago. I started to fight it by reforming old economic structures and creating a powerful and free economy. People had more money in their pockets and more freedom back then. But the system manipulated my elections for president and even killed people to force me out of office. They continued to chase me, tried to prosecute me and imprison me, and I had to fight for my innocence, just like Mr. Trump.\n\nI made my mistakes but now I come back smarter and stronger. The system cannot threaten me anymore, and I know its weaknesses. I know I have a strong backing from the new U.S. administration, and I\u2019m going to push new reforms to release both the Romanian economy and Romanian democracy because our people deserve to live better. It\u2019s time for the Romanian people to become the first priority and have the system to bow to the sovereign.\n\n Media: The other weekend, Americans were seeing images on TV of German police arresting people in their homes for social media posts around Europe. Vice President Vance highlighted his concerns about censorship and the suppression of dissent within European countries. What is your stance on these issues within Romania? How would your administration ensure the protection of free speech and political diversity, while safeguarding national security?\n\nVictor Ponta: I can guarantee one thing for sure \u2013 when I\u2019m president, no one in Romania will be arrested for social media posts unless there is a clear and present danger that the person is about to commit a serious and violent crime, like in the form of terrorism.\n\nThe rules and atmosphere of public discussion have changed and we must adapt. Things that were forbidden to say a few decades ago are mainstream today. I am totally disgusted by a culture of cancel where certain views are not allowed to be expressed. Limiting free speech is not the answer \u2013 open debate is. We cannot close ourselves and listen only to the ones who have a similar opinion to ours.\n\n Media: With President Trump\u2019s return to office, there appears to be a shift in U.S. foreign policy \u2013 emphasizing support for conservative values and a reevaluation of traditional alliances. A recent poll of Romanians had 62% believing that President Trump\u2019s election was good for Romanians. How do you envision Romania navigating its relationship with the U.S. under this administration? What opportunities or challenges do you foresee arising from this renewed U.S. leadership?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVictor Ponta: The trends in America resemble those in Romania. In these times of uncertainties, we begin to realize how important tradition and faith are as a sense of stability, comfort, and guidance. Romanians didn\u2019t lose their faith in God during the years of communism, and now more and more people return to the churches and monasteries that were a great part of our tradition and values.\n\nThere is a side in Europe that is more traditional. Countries like Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Italy present a different attitude towards the North Atlantic relationship than France or Netherlands. We want closer ties with the U.S, and closer economic ties \u2013 built on reciprocity and fairness. Romania needs to contribute more to security because that is the only way to secure peace. Europe, without the U.S., is vulnerable, and we must understand that this is a partnership where everyone must feel satisfied. If America thinks it is treated unfairly in terms of trade, we must solve those issues together.\n\nThe problem is that, today, the voice of Romania is absent. We are not a small country in the EU but our leadership behaves as a vassal state with no opinion or contribution. We must have our place at the table and make sure that Romania\u2019s interests are fulfilled. When I was prime minister, Romania was growing fast and was attractive to investments from U.S. companies. Now our economy is headed for stagflation, and no one wants to come. Growth is weak and prices are soaring, because our economy is practically managed by an old, self-serving, corrupt system using economic methods that didn\u2019t even work in the 20th century, let alone in the 21st.\n\nI know how to change this, and the only way is by flipping the system on its head; by cutting down on bloated public administration, cutting down on taxes, using our own resources for energy independence, opening the system for more competition, encouraging consumption, and supporting Romanian small businesses. Just like what is done now by the Trump administration in the U.S.\n\n Media: You were prime minister of Romania from 2013-2015, and it was thought you were leaving politics at the end of 2020. Then you ran and won a seat in parliament in December. What made you get back into the arena?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVictor Ponta: When I was PM ten years ago, the economy was soaring. We cut taxes and encouraged investments and results soon followed. The money flowed to people\u2019s pockets, and I had even bigger and better plans.\n\nThe system didn\u2019t like it. They manipulated the elections, and \u2013 I dare to say \u2013 even caused peoples\u2019 deaths in order to turn the people against me and stop me. I couldn\u2019t fight the system and the people at the same time. When I resigned, taking responsibility for things not directly under my control, I said I will always be on the side of the people. I thought others might come in my place and have the opportunity to continue the progress. Instead, the politicians who took control only thought about themselves, gave up on Romania\u2019s interests, and brought our country to misery and almost bankruptcy.\n\nThe last straw was the cancelling of the elections. I understood that the system also wants to take away the people\u2019s voice and that I can no longer remain on the fence. Otherwise, we will really lose everything. We have reached the point of now or never. It is not only shameful and undemocratic but also dangerous. This is the place where democracy ends and tyranny starts.\n\nI want to give people back their voice and their right to choose. I want to give people a sense of control over the system. There is a way to change the system \u2013 America has shown us how. And I want to bring the sense of fairness and prosperity back to our people. I have learned from my mistakes and am coming back even more determined to flip the system on its head. I want to put Romanian people in the first place.\n\n Media: The Trump administration has been critical of the European Union\u2019s bureaucracy and regulatory overreach. How would a pro-Trump Romanian presidency challenge or reform EU policies to make them more favorable to stronger borders, less centralized governance, and greater national autonomy within the Union?\n\nVictor Ponta: The first thing we have to do is look at ourselves. The system in Romania is bloated and inefficient, and that puts a heavy burden on our growth. One of the goals of my project for Romania 2030 is to have an efficient, professional government with a reduced administration. I would like to cut 20% of the Romanian administration workforce across the board, sparing those with direct contact with citizens, like teachers, doctors, and nurses. Such a measure would weed out inefficiency and waste, and allow us to raise salaries for those remaining \u2013 thus attracting better people. Citizens are tired of government offices that only serve themselves and a system that doesn\u2019t care about them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n Media: It is often said that a man is measured by the enemies he makes \u2013 who are the forces that don\u2019t want you running? What do you say to Romanians who might be undecided?\n\nVictor Ponta: The interference in elections didn\u2019t start today but already existed back when I ran for president 11 years ago. The system used all its powers to manipulate the elections in a very unfair way. After I lost, they didn\u2019t stop. They were afraid of me returning to power and orchestrated the legal system against me. I had to face several bogus charges that eventually were dismissed.\n\nI thank God I was able in the last few years to build my independent business \u2013 not connected to anything in Romania. I am totally free from the system, and they cannot threaten me anymore. It is not to say they are not trying. I am getting hints and messages that show me that I am still very much feared by very powerful groups in the Romanian state. In the years since I left office, the system only got stronger, more arrogant, and more determined.\n\nFortunately, today I am more experienced and smarter. I know exactly the weaknesses of the system and how to counter it. I am much more determined than before because I know it is now or never. If the system can get away with cancelling the elections and blocking people\u2019s voices then we are headed for doom. In these elections, I ask voters to consider who has a plan to transfer power from the system to the people, and who already has experience in making Romanians \u2013 and not the system \u2013 wealthier and more prosperous. We have a resourceful and rich country, and our citizens should be the first ones to benefit and enjoy this. Romanians should feel they are in the first place, not some self-serving system beholden by corruption and foreign interests.\n\n Media: Thank you. As we wrap up, what would you like to say to the average American citizen who may not typically pay attention to Romanian politics from 5,000-6,000 miles away?\n\nVictor Ponta: I want to say to all Americans that Romania and Europe are your allies in making a world where the values of democracy and freedom of speech are paramount. I want to say that the U.S. and Romania have lots of economic opportunities to discuss, and we are open to American companies and investors. And I want to say that Romania is one of the most, if not the most, beautiful countries in Europe, with ancient traditions and mysteries \u2013 like the home of Count Dracula \u2013 and I invite and welcome American tourists to come and explore and enjoy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThank you.\n\n*This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.",

        "full_text": "Pity poor John Roberts. No, he\u2019s not corrupt or compromised. He is simply a man who has found himself at a pivotal time and place in a position of great responsibility for which he is utterly unsuited. He\u2019s not a dumb man. He is, in fact, a very smart man \u2013 Hugh Hewitt knew him personally in the Reagan administration and testifies to that. I have no doubt it\u2019s true. I know many smart people who have similar flaws. As objectively intelligent as John Roberts is, he is unwise, and he is endangering the institution he wants to preserve because he does not understand human nature or the times he finds himself in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrankly, I\u2019ll take wisdom over raw intellect any day of the week.\n\nIf he had the capacity to lead that he so manifestly lacks, John Roberts could save his institution with decisive and bold action. But that\u2019s not who he is. Understand what John Roberts wants. He is an institutionalist who has always wanted to protect the judiciary branch. He wants it to be a fully co-equal branch that is respected by all. But the veryactions he has chosen to take \u2013 or not to take \u2013 in response to the current crisis of out-of-control subordinate courts are guaranteeing that it will fall.\n\nArticle III of our Constitution provides for the judicial branch, but it does notexpresslyprovide the judiciary with any powers other than those it earns in the eyes of the other two branches.It cannot self-enforce its decrees.Article I creates the Congress, and the legislative branch has both the power of the purse and the power to impeach to check the judiciary. Article II establishes the presidency, but the Constitution does not specify its checks and balances over the court. That power is implied, and the implied power is for the executive \u2013 who runs the machinery of the federal government, including the cogs and gears that carry guns \u2013 to simply say \u201cNo\u201d to an out-of-control judiciary. This implied power of defiance is as much a check and balance as any enumerated one, and without it, you would have an unchecked judiciary with hundreds of district court judges presuming to micromanage the legitimate actions of the executive branch.\n\nYou know, kind of like what\u2019s happening now.\n\nJudge Roberts\u2019s problem is that he wants to return to something like regular order in the judiciary. What we have is highly irregular order. You non-lawyers need to understand that all these temporary restraining orders and injunctions and so forth are insane. This is not how law is done, either procedurally or substantively. I did litigation for 30 years, including in federal courts (up to arguing in front of the Ninth Circuit), and never saw anything remotely like these antics. So, realize that this is abnormal.\n\nAbnormal times call for abnormal responses, but that\u2019s not how John Roberts or his ilk work. Remember, he\u2019s a Bushie, the kind of soft Republican who sees his job less asfixing our broken government than managing its gentlemanly decline. We\u2019ve largely booted them out of elective office, but Roberts has his seat for life. His advocation is protecting his institution. He wants the judiciary to be held in respect and obeyed, but he doesn\u2019t want to do the hard, stern work of disciplining his underlings that makes that possible.\n\nJohn Roberts wants the normal appellate procedures to apply. He\u2019s hoping that if he shuts his eyes and pretends that everything is normal, he\u2019ll open them and it will all be normal again. This was the main takeaway from his unbelievably tone-deaf response to Trump\u2019s, Musk\u2019s, and others\u2019 frustration-driven talk about impeachment. Now, Roberts was right in theory about what he said, but what we\u2019re facing is not theory but practice. Putaside the practical reality that we\u2019re not going to be able to impeach anybody, and don\u2019t fall for the Internet amateur ambulance chasers who think there\u2019s one neat trick where we can somehow get rid of judges by a majority vote because of \u201cbad behavior.\u201d That is a reason to get rid of them, not a means. The means is impeachment, and that takes 67 senators. That\u2019s never going to happen so we should stop talking about it.They would wear a failed impeachment like Tim Walz would have worn his war medals if he had shown up to earn any.Haven\u2019t we learned not to engage in failure theater?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn normal times, the response toa judge over one dumb decision is the appellate process. But these are not normal times. These are not one dumb decision. These are dozens of dumb decisions. And the answer here is not the appellate process because the appellate process is long, drawn out, and deliberate. The goal of this campaign is to use that delay to effectively strip Donald Trump of the ability to govern. To that end, they have sought towrap him up in aweb of orders and injunctions that will prevent him fromdoing the things he was elected to do. If it was one case or ten cases, you could wait months and months for the appellate process to grind through.Eventually,Trump administration will win most of these cases through the appellate process because they\u2019re procedurally and substantively ridiculous. But the purpose of these judicial antics is not to fulfill the letter of the law, but to create friction that improperly prevents political actions that the executive has the right to take. In other words, Donald Trump may live in the White House, but he can\u2019t actually be President, thereby disenfranchising the people who elected him.\n\nSo, we have a system that is not being used normally and that is not being used for a normal purpose. But Chief Justice Roberts, in his lack of wisdom, refuses to see that abnormal actions sometimes require abnormal responses. As I have said before, he will never be able to normal the abnormal back to normality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe thinks he can force normality back onto the judiciary by simply pretending the abnormality doesn\u2019t exist and that everything is hunky-dory. He can\u2019t. He must force normality back onthe judiciary by addressing the abnormality directly. That means he has to take abnormal actions in response. Procedurally, he needs to lead the charge to stop the imposition and use of these bizarre nationwide orders and injunctions by giving the circuit courts of appeal clear guidance to end this nonsense. Substantively, he needs to direct the circuit courts to issue stays on district court orders that far exceed the scope of the judiciary\u2019s proper powers. And if the circuit courts of appeal refuse to do that, then the Supreme Court needs to issue the orders to enforce its will, even if that means issuing dozens and dozens of orders. The Supreme Court only takes 50 or socases a year. With over 100 lawsuits against the Trump administration as part of this lawfare campaign, that workload no longer works.\n\nWhat John Roberts is risking by refusing to put an end to these abuses is the Trump administration putting an end to these abuses by exercising its implied power under the Constitution to check an out-of-control judiciary. If an order issues and no one enforces it, is it really an order?\n\nJohn Roberts is running out of friends. The leftists hate him. They\u2019ll tolerate him as long as he\u2019s useful, but he\u2019s not going to find any political support on the Democrat side when they come back into power. He\u2019s got a little in the tank left on the right, but if he keeps this up, he\u2019s going to be running on empty. Roberts still thinks that he can dip his toe into politics to protect his institution (see, e.g., his ridiculous, political Obamacare opinion), but he hasn\u2019t thought through how he can do that without any friends to back him up when the executive pushes back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt some point, unless Robert puts a stop to this misconduct, Trump will simply refuse to obey. And when he does, he will ensure it is over some utterly outrageous order where he is acting both at the height of his Article II powers (like on some issue that involves command of the military or protecting America from foreign terrorists and gangsters) and at the height of his political power (like on some issue where he\u2019s on the 80% side of an 80/20 split). He will resist from strength, while the judiciary fulminates impotently from weakness.\n\nLots of people are asking why Trump is not defying the courts now. It\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t have to. The Department of Justice under Pam Bondi is doing an incredible jobof litigating these cases \u2013 I\u2019ve read a lot of briefs over the years, and the DOJ lawyers are writing terrific ones. The Administration is passively aggressively obeying these orders, being very picayune and literal in its interpretation of them, but it is not outright defying them. Nor should it. Outright defiance of a court order is another 80/20 issue, but 80% of normals right now believe the President should obey court orders. That will change if this keeps up and as Trump highlights the abuses, but right now, America is not politically ready for that fight, and Trump doesn\u2019t need topull the trigger yet.\n\nYet.\n\nBut John Roberts better understands that if it comes to obeying the courts or neutering the executive branch and defying the will of the people, as expressed in the last election, the courts are going to lose. They don\u2019t have any cops. They don\u2019t have any Army divisions. All they have is their respect, and John Roberts\u2019s underlings are busy squandering it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSadly, so far, John Roberts has shown no indication that he is wise enough to put a stop to this runaway train of out-of-control judicial election interference. He believes he\u2019s acting to protect the judicial branch. He is not. His George Costanza-like gut instinct is always wrong. He would be better off interrogating his gut and then doing precisely the opposite.\n\nA decision point is coming. Decisive actionby the Chief Justicecould save the judicial branch byrestoring the judicial modesty that preserves the respect of the other branches. If only we could be confident that John Roberts was wise enough to do it.\n\nFollow Kurt on Twitter .

        "full_text": "Say what you will about Donald Trump, nobody can argue that he doesn\u2019t possess an amazing superpower. Actually, he has several superpowers, but his most powerful may be the ability to convince his opponents to defend the least popular possible positions just because he supports them. Not just contrary positions, not just positions that reasonable people can disagree with, but insanely unpopular positions that all normal people look at and are repelled by. There\u2019s not a garbage hill they won\u2019t choose to die on. It\u2019s an incredibly useful superpower to have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, the most recent one is the 80/20 polling proposition against men pretending to be women and being allowed into women\u2019s intimate spaces to steal their athletic achievements. What lunatic would possibly take the position that it\u2019s OK for some dude with the whole sausage store swinging to walk into your daughter\u2019s locker room and expect to be called Martha? Well, it\u2019s not just one lunatic. It\u2019s a whole party of lunatics. This is a sacred Democrat belief, maybe its most sacred belief. Just the other day, every single Democrat senator voted to continue this nonsense. But in the real world, eight out of 10 normal people understand that it\u2019s insane, and the other 20%, probably half of them, don\u2019t agree with the majority because they can\u2019t wrap their minds around the fact that it\u2019s actually happening.\n\nOf course, Trump opposes it, and of course, he rubbed it in their faces at that glorious not-State of the Union address the other night. Naturally, the Democrats highlighted their embrace of this bizarre, creepy fringe belief system right in front of 36 million Americans. It\u2019s no wonder that 76% of the people who watched the thing supported the president. Politically, it\u2019s just insane to draw the battle lines about weirdos and perverts, but the Democrats do it. It kind of tells you what their main constituency is \u2013 weirdos and perverts and the SSRI-ridden, Chardonnay wine Munchhausen Mommies that love them.\n\nEmbracing it makes absolutely no sense politically unless their entire focus is maintaining their psychotic leftist activist base. And, of course, their entire focus is maintaining their psychotic leftist activist base. You might think they would reach out in a systematic way to normal people, and some have tried. Gavin Newsom, the guy whose unalloyed support for kiddie castration and against penis-free female environments helped make California the sexual confusion capital of America, recently went on with Charlie Kirk and hinted that, well, you know, maybe it\u2019s kinda unfair to let some hairy ape pretending to be a ballerina win the gold medal in a girl track meet. Don\u2019t get the idea that he is actually going to do anything about it. California is still a gender freak state where every pervert is a king, and every normal person is liable to be leered at in the locker room \u2013 and, in his trash state, if you complain that some dude in a skirt is drooling over you while you slip on your panties, you\u2019re a hate criminal. Other Democrats have realized that this is electoral cyanide, and they\u2019ve tried to thread the needle by suggesting that maybe local governments should decide whether the perverts rule or not. They don\u2019t think that about anything else, like abortion, just this, and they don\u2019t really think it. If they get federal power back, you can be sure that the full force of law will come down in support of weirdo transvestites getting a free pass at exposing themselves to little girls.\n\nTrump is somehow able to maneuver them into being all for such loathsome demographics as federal workers. Yeah, Americans feel sorry for the kind of person who tells them they can\u2019t sign their VA form in blue ink. Not a lotta sympathy there. And Americans seem to like the idea of cutting government waste. Sure, the Democrats insist that we\u2019re about to launch a Third World genocide by refusing to fully fund Ecuadorian transgender mime troupes, but normal people look at that and hear that it\u2019s being cut, and they think it\u2019s a good thing. This is because it is, objectively, a good thing. To support this stuff is, objectively, an insane thing.\n\nNow, it\u2019s not crazy in the sense that doing so does support the Democrat position that all normality and civilization must be overthrown in favor of the bizarre, creepy freak show utopia that they hope to impose upon us. It\u2019s insane because it\u2019s electoral poison. Look at what happened to Kamala Harris when she got up there and had to try and tap dance about subsidizing illegal alien transsexual surgeries. It\u2019s hard to explain this sort of stuff, and it should be hard because this sort of stuff is stupid and horrific. A few Democrats understand that this stuff repels normal people. That\u2019s their problem. And that\u2019s Trump\u2019s edge.\n\nWhat\u2019s the latest? Some Third World Muslim scumbag terrorist-lover who somehow got into our country and somehow got into one of our allegedly prestigious schools is using that as a base to demand the murder of Jews and everybody else. Remember \u2013 they don\u2019t just want to stop killing all the Jews. They want to kill you and me, too. They will tell you that if you listen, and thanks to the fact that we have broken the gatekeeping model of the regime media, conservative media, and social media can now tell you. You can go read what this scumbag\u2019s positions are. He wants October 7 all over the world. That means you and your kids and your sons and your daughters are being raped and murdered on videotape for the delight of Third World semi-humans. Yeah, we\u2019re totally morally obligated to let this creature onto our soil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s been said before: The Constitution is not a suicide pact.\n\nNow, the reasonable position among Americans is that this kind of walking, talking pile of refried goat excrement shouldn\u2019t be anywhere near our country. It\u2019s not a matter of free speech. You don\u2019t get to come here and start setting up your garbage revolution. Do the Democrats agree with that view? No. They\u2019re perfectly happy to let the genocidal jihadi to do his thing. In this monster, they have finally found some \u201cfree speech\u201d they\u2019re concerned with protecting. They were never concerned with free speech on campus when it was conservatives trying to speak freely. They were never concerned when the federal government launched a pogrom against normal Americans who went to protest a bogus election and dared to walk through the Capitol that they own. Even now, Democrats are positively gleeful that Elon Musk\u2019s participation in our government is being met by leftist-funded terrorists burning down Tesla stores. But this Hamas-sucking mutant who literally wants to murder you and your entire family? No, he\u2019s got to be here. He\u2019s got to get a free megaphone. He has every right to come here and destroy our country and kill your kids. Because of reasons and shut up, fascist.\n\nThat\u2019s the Democrat position. But why do they hold such a manifestly politically unpopular position? Because that\u2019s what the black, shriveled heart of the Democrat Party believes. And also because Donald Trump feels differently. One thing is for certain \u2013 Donald Trump\u2019s superpower is in full effect, and right now, he\u2019s laughing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow Kurt on Twitter .

        "full_text": "The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is allegedly implicated in a vast, government-backed censorship scheme, according to internal documents obtained by law group America First Legal through ongoing litigation against the U.S. Department of State's Global Engagement Center (GEC).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCopies of communications released Thursday reveal an alliance among USAID; the GEC; the British Foreign, Commonwealth, & Development Office (FCDO), which is the UK's foreign affairs ministry; and multiple media censorship firms, \"all working in lock-step to manipulate public discourse, control media narratives, and suppress free speech,\" particularly that of dissenting voices, America First Legal says.\n\nAs part of this censorship conspiracy, the GEC and USAID allegedly worked together to censor \"COVID-19 misinformation.\"\n\nIn a widely distributed email to USAID, per America First Legal, the GEC's \"Liaison Planner to USAID\" stated that they'd like to \u201csustain dialogue and connectivity during these unprecedented times\" to help counter so-called \"misinformation\" surrounding COVID-19. The records show that GEC extensively communicated with an assortment of USAID branches, including \"TF 2020-COVID 19,\" \"Digital Development,\" Asia Bureau ES Taskers,\" \"Asia Outreach,\" \"Conflict Prevention and Stabilization (CPS) Policy,\" and \"CPS Africa.\"\n\nAccording to America First Legal's findings, the GEC also collaborated with private-sector internet censors, such as Poynter and NewsGuard, to use AI censorship tools for monitoring \"misinformation.\"\n\nTwo days after the 2020 presidential election, Matt Skibinski, general manager of NewsGuard Technologies, started an email chain pitching NewsGuard's services. Included in this email chain were government employees with the U.S. State Department, the National Security Agency (NSA), and U.S. Defense Department components, including the National Security Innovation Network (NSIN), U.S. Cyber Command, and the U.S. Army European Command.\n\nThe principal email recipient was ex-Obama State Department official Christina Nemr, the director of Park Advisors at the time. Park Advisors, according to Nemr's LinkedIn page, \"Designed and led multi-million public-private initiatives addressing security threats in the information environment, bridging gaps between emerging technologies and real-world operational needs.\" In this role, Nemr said she also \"support[ed] government adoption.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year, the U.S. House Small Business Committee found that Park Advisors received a GEC cooperative agreement award of more than $6 million. Park Advisors then distributed subawards to several companies, including NewsGuard, the Atlantic Council, and the Global Disinformation Index, a Soros-funded project that reportedly generated a blacklist of conservative websites that advertising companies should boycott.\n\nTogether, these groups, which are not subject to the same international restrictions that GEC was, tested disinformation products, leading to the creation of the \"Disinfo Cloud,\" an unclassified platform used by the U.S. government and other world powers \"to counter adversarial propaganda and disinformation.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSkibinski provided samples of the new GEC/U.S Cybercommand Testbed Pilot (a.k.a. \"Misinformation Fingerprints\"), a program utilizing artificial intelligence and machine learning to monitor \"misinformation,\" flag examples, and rank sites accordingly.\n\nResearch from the Foundation For Freedom Online revealed how NewsGuard operates the enforcement arm of the censorship industry and rates websites based on how much perceived \"misinformation\" each page publishes.\n\nFurthermore, on February 4, 2021, Vonda Wolcott, senior program manager at the Institute for War and Peace Reporting, connected GEC's Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) \"expert\" with Baybars Orsek from Poynter, which, according to America First Legal, funds a global false-flag operation of international \"fact-checkers.\" Though they claim to be independent, this army of content moderators pledge fealty to a tightly woven network bankrolled by Poynter and the GEC.\n\nOne of the released emails illustrates how closely GEC and Poynter worked in tandem, with GEC's \"expert\" offering to \"walk [Poynter] through GEC's new M&E workbook.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the investigative work of America First Legal, the GEC also collaborated with foreign officials in the British Foreign, Commonwealth, & Development Office on \"disinformation\" efforts.\n\nThe now-defunct GEC, which was established by then-President Barack Obama via executive order, \"counter[ed] foreign disinformation\" before it was forced to shut down in December 2024 following a number of First Amendment lawsuits. Through several Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, America First Legal previously uncovered that the GEC engaged in state-sponsored propaganda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The partnership between USAID and the Global Engagement Center is bad news for the American people. Add in the fact that they were coordinating with internet censorship enforcers at NewsGuard and Poynter, and you can start to see just how dangerous this unholy alliance is for free speech and free expression,\" America First Legal senior counsel Andrew Block said in a statement. \"Thankfully, the GEC is shuttered and USAID is being exposed \u2014 but lawmakers should take note of this example as they consider legislation to ensure the federal government actually serves American principles and interests.\"\n\n knows all too well what it\u2019s like to be the target of internet censors like NewsGuard. They\u2019ve tried to silence us, to bully us into only covering the \u201capproved narrative.\u201d But thanks to the support of our VIP members, we get to keep sharing the facts and stories that matter most to our you.",

        "full_text": "Our immigration system is broken; you hear it being said all the time by politicians and media types, but what they never say is how or why. Their only response to anything related to immigration is \u201cWe need comprehensive reform,\u201d which always includes \u201ca pathway to citizenship,\u201d which is code for voting. We see it. But the truth of the matter is that the system isn\u2019t broken; the people running it are.\n\nIf you had a brand new car, opened the hood, and started pulling wires or loosening bolts, it would not work very well, would it? If you have an entire immigration system in place, then, over years, start ignoring parts of it while randomly changing other parts. How well do you think it will function?\n\nThat\u2019s what these people have done to the immigration system. They whine is \u201cbroken.\u201d You broke it, you jerks. It doesn\u2019t need \u201cfixing\u201d by creating something new or wiping the slate clean, it needs to be allowed to function. They don\u2019t let it. They won\u2019t let it.\n\nPutting that aside, there is one question that needs to be asked of anyone looking to enter our country, either to visit or wanting to live here with the possibility of becoming a citizen: What do we get out of it?\n\nThat\u2019s all that matters. If you bring nothing to the table, you don\u2019t get in. Period.\n\nThat brings us to the case of Mahmoud Khalil.\n\nWe let him into the country to attend school, and he married an American. That\u2019s still not a free pass to be here; he only has a green card.\n\nWhat does he bring to the table, exactly?\n\nHe apparently graduated 6 months ago but had time to lead pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, and anti-American protests at the school he used to attend. Columbia is very, very expensive; how can he afford not to work? They keep repeating how he\u2019s \u201cgot a pregnant wife at home,\u201d shouldn\u2019t he be working? How about simply being at home, since his wife is 8 months pregnant and he\u2019s just a simple family man, right?\n\nThe guy has more lawyers than some towns, each more expensive than the last, but he\u2019s just an innocent guy who never did anything to nobody or something.\n\nThere are a lot of unanswered questions about what makes this guy so special: to somehow have mobilized the left in a way they haven\u2019t been able to muster in years. Where does his money come from? Maybe he\u2019s rich, maybe he married rich. Perhaps he has patrons? Perhaps it\u2019s the left-wing industrial complex that launders USAID money to anti-American activities around the globe?\n\nAll I know is my question of \u201cWhat do we get out of it?\u201d doesn\u2019t seem to have an involved answer.\n\nIt\u2019s not like we need another anti-Semite; we have the Democratic Party, after all. We don\u2019t need more anti-Americans; like I said, we already have Democrats. Do we need more people with graduate degrees in \u201cpublic administration\u201d? Don\u2019t we produce enough of those from people born here with a lifelong understanding of our government and how it works? Do we need someone from Syria to do it?\n\nWe don\u2019t, we\u2019re all full.\n\nWe have all the native-born BLM/ANTIFA members; we don\u2019t need more ungrateful, privileged 30-year-olds with nothing better to do than incite people. We\u2019re lousy and overloaded with them.\n\nThe message should be sent that people can\u2019t come to this country and disrupt it; inspiring violence or hatred is not going to get you welcome here; it will get you invited to leave. No other country would accept it; why should we?\n\nForeigners are afforded rights when they enter this country, but they are not citizens. People on vacation, in school, or married on green cards are here at our pleasure, not theirs. Break the law, and you\u2019re out. Be particularly annoying, and you\u2019re out. Or should be.\n\nWhen I was 15, I took driver\u2019s ed. Throughout the 6 weeks, or whatever it was, the instructors drilled into our heads that \u201cdriving is a privilege, not a right,\u201d and the state could strip us of it at any point, should we screw up and get too many tickets or whatever. Why should guests in our country not be treated the same way when it comes to being in the country? It\u2019s a privilege, not a right, no matter the conditions you are here or for how long.",

        "full_text": "8 days ago\n\nQuentin Sommerville\n\n, in Tijuana and Philadelphia\u2022\n\nThe fentanyl dealer from Los Angeles stands to the side watching carefully as a Mexican drugs cartel operative prepares his latest shipment. The synthetic opioid drug is wrapped in foil, sealed in plastic, then dropped with an oily splash into the petrol tank of the trafficker's nondescript car.\n\nJay, not his real name, had crossed earlier from the US to this cartel-run safe house on the Mexican side of the border. The house looks like any other in this neighbourhood. We are told to drive in quickly and an iron gate closes firmly behind us. They don't cook the drug here, but still they are wary of attracting attention. The men all speak in hushed voices and work quickly.\n\nTheir lethal business has become the centre of a global economic dispute. The White House has used fentanyl smuggling through US borders as a key justification for raising tariffs on other nations. US President Donald Trump has also vowed to \"wage war\" on the drug cartels.\n\nThe gained rare access to a cartel's operation along the border and travelled to the US to meet their ultimate customers, to see if the international row was doing anything to halt the illegal flow of narcotics.\n\nThe men we meet at the safe house are foot-soldiers of a well-known cartel. Two of them loading the car admit to fleeting moments of remorse. But when I ask the man packing the drugs into the fuel tank if he feels guilty about the deaths the pills cause, he sniggers. \"We have family too, of course we feel guilty. But if I stop, it's going to continue. It's not my problem,\" he tells me with a shrug.\n\nThe men keep their faces covered while they remove the back seat of the car to gain access to the tank, taking care not to spill petrol. The smell inside the car could alert customs officers on the other side of the border that the fuel tank has been tampered with.\n\nThe light green pills, 5,000 in total and marked with an M, are packed tightly - a fraction of what Jay says he sells every week in LA and across the American northwest.\n\n\"I try to get 100,000 pills a week, every week,\" the softly spoken dealer tells me. \"I don't send them in one vehicle. I try to spread it in different cars. That way I minimise my risk of losing all my pills.\"\n\nA 25% tariff on all goods from Mexico was introduced in response to what President Donald Trump said was the unacceptable flow of illegal drugs and illegal immigrants into the US. Some of those tariffs have since been delayed until 2 April.\n\nDefeating the fentanyl trade is one of President Trump's top policy goals, but Jay doesn't rate his chances.\n\n\"Last time he was in office, he tried to do the same thing, and it never happened. There's always going to be a demand. And where's the biggest demand? United States, lucky for us. We're here in the border,\" says Jay with a smile.\n\nThere is so much of the drug flowing into the US, most of it coming from Mexico, that according to Jay the price he sells it for in LA has fallen from about $5 or $6 per pill a year ago, to $1.50 now (\u00a31.16).\n\nMexican police say cartels switched in a big way to fentanyl, which is 50 times more potent than heroin, because unlike other opiates - which are made from the opium poppy - it is completely synthetic and much easier to make and transport.\n\nFentanyl's strength and addictiveness has left a deep scar on American society: drug overdoses kill more people in the US than guns or car crashes. Fatalities have started to decline, perhaps due in part to the greater availability of Naloxone, a drug that reverses the effects of overdoses of opioids. But the latest figures are still stark: 87,000 overdose deaths (mostly from opioids) from October 2023 to September 2024, down from 114,000 the year before.\n\nIn an attempt to stave off punitive tariffs from the White House, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has pledged to send 10,000 National Guard troops to the border. The government has made more than 900 arrests since October in Sinaloa, a major drug trafficking hub. Back in December, Mexico announced its biggest ever fentanyl seizure in the state: more than a tonne of pills. In fact, the country has seized more fentanyl in the past five months than it did in the previous year.\n\nMexico has also made it harder to import a key ingredient of fentanyl from China, prompting cartels to reduce the strength of each pill - and, in the process, making them less deadly.\n\nAnd at the end of February, 29 senior drug cartel figures were handed over to the United States, including members of five of the six Mexican crime syndicates that President Trump's administration recently designated as terrorist organisations.\n\nPresident Sheinbaum also said she had agreed to the CIA increasing surveillance drone operations over Mexican territory in search of fentanyl drugs labs, after the media revealed the covert missions.\n\nJay acknowledges the dangers of his trade to himself and his customers, but is untroubled.\n\n\"They always try to blame us, that we are the ones that are poisoning American citizens. But they're the biggest users.\"\n\nHe coolly insulates himself from responsibility and guilt for the deaths his drugs cause. He claims not to know anyone who has died using his product. \"I only deal with other suppliers,\" he tells me.\n\nThe cartels mostly use American citizens to courier their drugs across the border, as they are less likely to be stopped by US Customs and Border Protection. The driver, who goes by the name Charlie, has a US passport. He, too, is mostly indifferent to the suffering the fentanyl epidemic has caused.\n\n\"I need the money,\" he says. When I ask him how many times he has made the drugs run, he replies: \"Too many.\" (I later learn that the 5,000 pills in the fuel tank made it across the border without incident.)\n\nPresident Sheinbaum has also recently emphasised the demand side of the crisis, saying the US fentanyl crisis began with the legal but \"irresponsible approval\" of painkillers, such as OxyContin, starting in the late 1990s. \"The US government should take responsibility for the opioid-consumption crisis that has caused so many deaths,\" she said at a daily news conference.\n\nOn the other side of the border is Derek Maltz, who has spent a lifetime in US drug enforcement. He has been made the interim leader of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and spoke to me just before his appointment.\n\n\"The Mexican cartels need to know that we're coming down there,\" he tells me. \"We're going to have aggressive operations to go after you and your business because you are killing our American kids at record levels and it's not going to be tolerated.\"\n\nMr Maltz agrees, though, that targeting the cartels alone will not solve the opioid crisis. \"The cartels are very bad guys,\" he tells me. \"They're transnational criminals. They're narco-terrorists. However, there is a bad demand problem in America, we have to address why our population is turning to drugs for help.\"\n\nIn Philadelphia's Kensington neighbourhood - dubbed the largest open-air drugs market on the US east coast - Rosalind Pichardo of Operation Save Our City is on to her second Bible. She records in the book's back pages the number of times she has reversed an opioid overdose using the quick-acting drug Naloxone.\n\nFor the past six years, the figure totals 2,931. She flicks through the pages and that number written in red comes alive with the memories of the individuals she saved, and the ones she lost.\n\nShe begins to list: \"Male in his 60s\u2026 male 30s\u2026 female in her 30s, very thin, no hair.\" Beside each name in this roll-call of fentanyl victims, is the number of doses of Naloxone - sold under the name Narcan - she used to attempt to revive people.\n\nMs Pichardo, who runs a drop-in centre called Sunshine House, operates what she calls a \"no-judgement zone\". She bristles at the terms like \"addict\", \"junkie\" or \"zombie\", which have been used to describe the people of her neighbourhood. Instead, she calls everyone \"sunshine\".\n\nSome she doesn't remember; others she will never forget.\n\n\"Look at this one, seven years old, two Narcans,\" she points out. Ms Pichardo had been called to a neighbour's house where a woman was holding in her arms a child who had turned blue. Ms Pichardo went inside and the girl was placed on the floor, but as she entered the child's father ran upstairs carrying a bag. \"I'm thinking if that was my child, I'd be running to help the child,\" she recalls.\n\nAt first, she thought it might be epilepsy, but she spotted drug scales and plastic baggies on a nearby table. The kid's dad was a drug dealer; the seven-year-old had been poisoned by his stash and overdosed. \"I was livid,\" she says.\n\nThose two doses of Narcan were enough to save the child's life.\n\nOn another page, a woman, six months pregnant, two doses of Narcan. She also survived.\n\nIn Kensington, drugs are cheap and plentiful, and people shoot up in the open. As she walks the neighbourhood, Ms Pichardo finds people passed out on the pavement, a woman in a stupor with her trousers down, a man lying prone next to a metro turnstile, another man in a wheelchair, his eyes closed and money in his hands.\n\nHe, like a growing number of opioid users, has had a limb amputated. A new drug on the street, the animal tranquilliser Xylazine, is being mixed with fentanyl. It leads to open wounds which become infected. The air is rank in places.\n\nJohn White is 56 years old, and for 40 of those years he has struggled with addiction. At Sunshine House, Ms Pichardo serves him a bowl of homemade soup.\n\n\"I've been in this city all my life,\" he says. \"The fentanyl and opioid epidemic is the worst I've ever seen. Fentanyl will get you so hooked that you have to get more. So they put it in everything.\"\n\nMr White had a fentanyl overdose after smoking a joint laced with the drug: it is being added to all kinds of illicit drugs, including heroin, cocaine and marijuana.\n\nMs Pichardo holds out little hope that even if the fentanyl trade is cut off from Mexico, it will improve people's lives in Kensington.\n\n\"The problem that we have with the war on drugs is - it didn't work then [and] I don't believe it's going to work now,\" she explains.\n\nWhen the supply of one drug is cut off, another replaces it, she says. \"Once there was heroin, now there's no more. Now there's fentanyl. When there's no fentanyl, now it's going to be Xylazine. So it's like they'll find a way to keep people addicted so that people can make money off of people, off the suffering of people,\" says Ms Pichardo.\n\nDirectly across from Sunshine House, a young woman is found collapsed on the pavement, her body splayed across the concrete: she's unresponsive. Ms Pichardo is quickly on the scene, her medical kit by her side, yet again administering Naloxone. The woman is eventually revived - she will survive.\n\nRoz Pichardo returns to Sunshine House, another life saved and another digit to be added to the back pages of her tattered Bible.\n\nTop picture: Darren Conway,",

        "full_text": "1 hour ago\n\nJude Sheerin\n\n, Washington\n\nPresident Donald Trump declared \"the American Dream is unstoppable\" as he addressed a raucous joint session of the US Congress for the first time since he returned to power.\n\nIn the longest presidential speech to lawmakers on record, he outlined his vision for his second term, as Republicans applauded a high-octane six weeks that has reshaped domestic and foreign policy.\n\nTrump was heckled by Democrats and he goaded them in turn during the rowdy primetime address.\n\nThe Republican president has moved to slash the federal workforce and crack down on immigration, while imposing tariffs on America's biggest trading partners and shaking up the transatlantic alliance over the war in Ukraine.\n\nHere are six of the key takeaways.\n\nTrump predicts a bumpy ride ahead on tariffs\n\nFollowing a second day of market turbulence, Trump played down the potential economic fallout from a trade war he ignited this week, including 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% on Chinese imports.\n\nBut in contrast with the ovations that greeted his other policy objectives, many Republicans remained seated, a sign of how Trump's import taxes have divided his party.\n\n\"Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again,\" he said.\n\n\"And it's happening. And it will happen rather quickly. There'll be a little disturbance, but we're okay with that. It won't be much.\"\n\nTrump added that reciprocal tariffs tailored to US trading partners would \"kick in\" on 2 April.\n\nEarlier in the day, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox Business that Trump could announce a trade deal with Mexico and Canada as soon as Wednesday.\n\nTrump will 'probably' cut tariffs, says commerce chief\n\nWhat are tariffs, and why is Trump using them?\n\nA minerals deal with Ukraine looks back on\n\nTrump said he had received an \"important letter\" from Ukraine's leader earlier in the day, which appeared to match what Volodymyr Zelensky posted publicly on social media.\n\nUkraine's president had said he was now ready to work under Trump's \"strong leadership\" to end the war and \"come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer\".\n\n\"I appreciate that he sent this letter,\" Trump told lawmakers.\n\nZelensky offered the olive branch a day after Trump paused all military aid to the beleaguered US ally.\n\nIt followed an acrimonious Oval Office meeting last week when the two leaders argued in front of TV cameras, before cancelling plans to sign a minerals deal that would allow the US to profit from an economic partnership involving Ukraine's resources.\n\nTrump was reportedly hoping to announce during his speech to Congress that the deal had finally been sealed. But it did not materialise.\n\nLive updates: Trump 'appreciates' Zelensky's message\n\nTrump and Zelensky's fraying relationship, in their own words\n\nGreenland is in his sights, Lesotho isn't\n\nDespite most of his 99-minute speech focusing on domestic issues, Trump's worldview also came more sharply into focus.\n\nThere are places in the world he wants to expand US influence and others where he wants to withdraw.\n\nRepeating his desire for the US to acquire Greenland, he vowed \"we're going to get it - one way or the other\". And he said his administration would \"reclaim\" the Panama Canal.\n\nThere were several mentions of African countries when he rattled through a list of what he described as wasteful spending under his predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\nLiberia, Mali, Mozambique and Uganda were all places unfairly benefiting from US aid, he said.\n\nBut his most pointed remark was about Lesotho, which he said was a country \"nobody has ever heard of\" despite receiving $8m (\u00a36.2m) to promote LGBT rights.\n\nWhy does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?\n\nHe stood by Musk despite protests over cuts\n\nEarly on Trump name-checked his billionaire adviser Elon Musk, who was watching from the gallery.\n\nThe tech mogul's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) taskforce has moved to fire tens of thousands of federal workers, cut billions of dollars in foreign aid and slash programmes across the US government.\n\nThe SpaceX and Tesla boss, wearing a dark suit with a blue tie, stood and acknowledged the cheers from the crowd.\n\n\"Thank you, Elon,\" the 78-year-old president said. \"He's working very hard. He didn't need this.\"\n\nMusk's cuts have sparked some angry scenes at town hall meetings and his instructions to federal employees have at times been overruled by members of Trump's cabinet.\n\nIn the chamber, Democratic lawmakers held up signs saying \"Musk steals\" and \"false\".\n\nDoge claims to have saved $105bn already but that figure can't be independently verified. Receipts have been published for $18.6bn worth of savings but accounting errors have been reported by US media outlets that have analysed the figures.\n\nYoung Republicans cheer Trump on from Texas watch party\n\nDemocratic pushback was loud and it was pink\n\nWithin the first five minutes of the address, Al Green of Texas was escorted out of the chamber by the sergeant-at-arms after refusing to comply with the House Speaker's demands that he stop heckling the president and take his seat.\n\nAs Trump spoke, other Democrats held up signs saying \"This is a lie\".\n\nWith Republicans in control of the White House, House of Representatives and Senate, Democrats have been largely leaderless as they work to hone their message and counter the blitz of activity from the Trump administration.\n\nMany Democratic women arrived in the House chamber wearing pink pantsuits in protest. Dozens from their party \u2013 some of them wearing the words \"Resist\" printed on the backs of their shirts - exited the chamber during the speech.\n\n\"There is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy,\" Trump said, appearing to revel in the partisan rancour.\n\nDemocratic leadership chose Elissa Slotkin of Michigan - a first-term senator elected in a battleground state that Trump won in November - to deliver the party's official response.\n\nShe accused Trump of an \"unprecedented giveaway to his billionaire friends\" and warned \"he could walk us right into a recession\".\n\nHe's betting on energy to bring down inflation\n\nTrump pledged to voters that he would beat inflation on his return to office and he used the speech to say his focus would be to reduce the cost of energy, by opening up the country to new oil and gas drilling.\n\n\"We have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on earth, and by far, and now I fully authorize the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it. It's called drill, baby, drill.\"\n\nThe soaring cost of eggs has been headline news in recent weeks, and Trump made clear who he felt was responsible.\n\n\"Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control - and we are working hard to get it back down,\" he added.\n\nEgg prices rose as the Biden administration directed millions of egg-laying birds to be culled last year amid a bird flu outbreak, though prices have continued rising in Trump's fledgling presidency.\n\nInflation was slightly elevated at 3% last month, but way down from its peak of 9.1% in 2022.\n\nOnly one in three Americans approve of Trump's handling of cost of living, according to a /Ipsos survey on Tuesday.\n\nFact-checking Trump's address to Congress\n\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "full_text": "Is the US really heading into a recession?\n\n8 days ago\n\nNatalie Sherman\n\nDuring his election campaign last year, Donald Trump promised Americans he would usher in a new era of prosperity.\n\nNow two months into his presidency, he's painting a slightly different picture.\n\nHe has warned that it will be hard to bring down prices and the public should be prepared for a \"little disturbance\" before he can bring back wealth to the US.\n\nMeanwhile, even as the latest figures indicate inflation is easing, analysts say the odds of a downturn are increasing, pointing to his policies.\n\nSo is Trump about to trigger a recession in the world's largest economy?\n\nMarkets fall and recession risks rise\n\nIn the US, a recession is defined as a prolonged and widespread decline in economic activity typically characterised by a jump in unemployment and fall in incomes.\n\nA chorus of economic analysts have warned in recent days that the risks of such a scenario are rising.\n\nA JP Morgan report put the chance of recession at 40%, up from 30% at the start of the year, warning that US policy was \"tilting away from growth\", while Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, upped the odds from 15% to 35%, citing tariffs.\n\nThe forecasts came as the S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest companies in the US sank sharply. It has now fallen to its lowest level since September in a sign of fears about the future.\n\nThe market turmoil is being driven partly by concerns about new taxes on imports, called tariffs, which Trump has introduced since he took office.\n\nHe has hit products from America's three biggest trade partners with the new duties, and threatened them more widely in moves that analysts believe will increase prices and curb growth.\n\nThe latest official inflation figures in the US showed the rate of price increases cooling in February, however.\n\nPrices were up 2.8% over the 12 months to February, down from 3% in January, the Labor Department said.\n\nStill, Trump and his economic advisers have been warning the public to be prepared for some economic pain, while appearing to dismiss the market concerns - a marked change from his first term, when he frequently cited the stock market as a measure of his own success.\n\n\"There will always be changes and adjustments,\" he said last week, in response to pleas from businesses for more certainty.\n\nThe posture has increased investor worries about his plans.\n\nGoldman Sachs last week raised its recession bets from 15% to 20%, saying it saw policy changes as \"the key risk\" to the economy. But it noted that the White House still had \"the option to pull back if the downside risks begin to look more serious\".\n\n\"If the White House remained committed to its policies even in the face of much worse data, recession risk would rise further,\" the firm's analysts warned.\n\nTariffs, uncertainty and slowing growth\n\nFor many firms, the biggest question mark is tariffs, which raise costs for US businesses by putting taxes on imports. As Trump unveils tariff plans, many companies are now facing lower profit margins, while holding off on investments and hiring as they try to figure out what the future will look like.\n\nInvestors are also worried about big cuts to the government workforce and government spending.\n\nBrian Gardner, chief of Washington policy strategy at the investment bank Stifel, said businesses and investors had thought Trump intended tariffs as a negotiating tool.\n\n\"But what the president and his cabinet are signalling is actually a bigger deal. It's a restructuring of the American economy,\" he said. \"And that's what's been driving markets in the last couple of weeks.\"\n\nThe US economy was already undergoing a slowdown, engineered in part by the central bank, which has kept interest rates higher to try to cool activity and stabilise prices.\n\nWhat are tariffs and why is Trump using them?\n\nSix things that could get more expensive\n\nIn recent weeks, some data suggests a more rapid weakening.\n\nRetail sales fell in February, confidence - which had popped after Trump's election on several surveys of consumers and businesses - has fallen, and companies including major airlines, retailers such as Walmart and Target, and manufacturers are warning of a pullback.\n\nSome analysts are worried a drop in the stock market could trigger a further clampdown in spending, especially among higher income households.\n\nThat could deliver a major hit to the US economy, which is driven by consumer spending and has grown increasingly dependent on those richer households, as lower income families face pressure from inflation.\n\nThe head of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, offered assurances in a speech last week, noting that sentiment had not been a good indicator of behaviour in recent years.\n\n\"Despite elevated levels of uncertainty, the US economy continues to be in a good place,\" he said.\n\nBut the US economy is currently deeply linked to the rest of the world, warned Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB.\n\n\"The fact that tariffs could disrupt that at the same time that there were signs that the US economy was weakening anyway ... is really fuelling recession fears,\" she says.\n\nStock market in tech ripe for correction\n\nThe unease in the stock market isn't all about Trump.\n\nInvestors were already jittery about the possibility of a correction, after big gains over the last two years, driven by the sharp run-up in tech stocks fuelled by investor optimism about artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nChipmaker Nvidia, for example, saw its share price jump from less than $15 at the start of 2023 to nearly $150 in November of last year.\n\nThat type of rise had stirred debate about an \"AI bubble\" - with investors on high alert for signs of it bursting, which would have a big impact on the stock market, regardless of the dynamics in the wider economy.\n\nNow, with views of the US economy darkening, optimism about AI is getting even harder to sustain.\n\nTech analyst Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management wrote on social media this week that his optimism had \"taken a step back\" as the chance of a recession increased \"measurably\" over the past month.\n\n\"The bottom line is that if we enter a recession, it will be extremely difficult for the AI trade to continue,\" he said.\n\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "full_text": "Chinese state media has welcomed Donald Trump's move to cut public funding for news outlets Voice of America and Radio Free Asia, which have long reported on authoritarian regimes.\n\nThe decision affects thousands of employees - some 1,300 staff have been put on paid leave at Voice Of America (VOA) alone since Friday's executive order.\n\nCritics have called the move a setback for democracy but Beijing's state newspaper Global Times denounced VOA for its \"appalling track record\" in reporting on China and said it has \"now been discarded by its own government like a dirty rag\".\n\nThe White House defended the move, saying it will \"ensure that taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda\".\n\nTrump's cuts target the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which is supported by Congress and funds the affected news outlets, such as VOA, Radio Free Asia (RFA) and Radio Free Europe.\n\nThey have won acclaim and international recognition for their reporting in places where press freedom is severely curtailed or non-existent, from China and Cambodia to Russia and North Korea.\n\nAlthough authorities in some of these countries block the broadcasts - VOA, for instance, is banned in China - people can listen to them on shortwave radio, or get around the restrictions via VPNs.\n\nRFA has often reported on the crackdown on human rights in Cambodia, whose former authoritarian ruler Hun Sen has hailed the cuts as a \"big contribution to eliminating fake news\".\n\nIt was also among the first news outlets to report on China's network of detention centres in Xinjiang, where the authorities are accused of locking up hundreds of thousands of Uyghur Muslims without trial. Beijing denies the claims, saying people willingly attend \"re-education camps\" which combat \"terrorism and religious extremism\". VOA's reporting on North Korean defectors and the Chinese Communist Party's alleged cover-up of Covid fatalities has won awards.\n\nVOA, primarily a radio outlet, which also broadcasts in Mandarin, was recognised last year for its podcast on rare protests in 2022 in China against Covid lockdowns.\n\nBut China's Global Times welcomed the cuts, calling VOA a \"lie factory\".\n\n\"As more Americans begin to break through their information cocoons and see a real world and a multi-dimensional China, the demonising narratives propagated by VOA will ultimately become a laughing stock,\" it said in an editorial published on Monday.\n\nHu Xijin, who was the Global Times' former editor-in-chief, wrote: \"Voice of America has been paralysed! And so has Radio Free Asia, which has been as vicious to China. This is such great news.\"\n\nSuch responses \"would have been easy to predict\", said Valdya Baraputri, a VOA journalist who lost her job over the weekend. She was previously employed by World Service.\n\n\"Eliminating VOA, of course, allows channels that are the opposite of accurate and balanced reporting to thrive,\" she told the .\n\nThe National Press Club, a leading representative group for US journalists, said the order \"undermines America's long-standing commitment to a free and independent press\".\n\nFounded during World War Two in part to counter Nazi propaganda, VOA reaches some 360 million people a week in nearly 50 languages. Over the years it has broadcast in China, North Korea, communist Cuba and the former Soviet Union. It's also been a helpful tool for many Chinese people to learn English.\n\nVOA's director Michael Abramowitz said Trump's order has hobbled VOA while \"America's adversaries, like Iran, China, and Russia, are sinking billions of dollars into creating false narratives to discredit the United States\".\n\nMs Baraputri, who is from Indonesia but based in Washington DC, first joined VOA in 2018, but her visa was terminated at the end of Trump's first administration.\n\nShe rejoined in 2023 because she wanted to be part of an organisation that \"upholds unbiased, factual reporting that is free from government influence\".\n\nThe recent cuts have left her \"feeling betrayed by the idea I had about press freedom [in the US]\".\n\nShe is also concerned for colleagues who may now be forced to return to hostile home countries, where they could be persecuted for their journalism.\n\nMeanwhile, the Czech Republic has appealed to the European Union to intervene so it can keep Radio Free Europe going. It reports in 27 languages from 23 countries, reaching more than 47 million people every week.\n\nRFA chief executive Bay Fang said in a statement that the organisation plans to challenge the order. Cutting funding to these outlets is a \"reward to dictators and despots, including the Chinese Communist Party, who would like nothing better than to have their influence go unchecked in the information space\", he said.\n\nRFA started in 1996 and reaches nearly 60 million people weekly in China, Myanmar, North Korea, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos. In China, it also broadcasts in minority languages like Tibetan and Uyghur, apart from English and Mandarin.\n\n\"[Trump's order] not only disenfranchises the nearly 60 million people who turn to RFA's reporting on a weekly basis to learn the truth, but it also benefits America's adversaries at our own expense,\" Mr Fang noted.\n\nWhile Chinese state media has celebrated the cuts, it's hard to know how Chinese people feel about it given their internet is heavily censored.\n\nOutside China, those who have listened to VOA and RFA over the years appear disappointed and worried.\n\n\"Looking back at history, countless exiles, rebels, intellectuals, and ordinary people have persisted in the darkness because of the voices of VOA and RFA, and have seen hope in fear because of their reports,\" Du Wen, a Chinese dissident living in Belgium, wrote on X.\n\n\"If the free world chooses to remain silent, then the voice of the dictator will become the only echo in the world.\"",

        "full_text": "Fact-checking Trump's address to Congress\n\n5 March 2025\n\nLucy Gilder, Jake Horton & Ben Chu\n\n Verfiy\n\nIn his address to Congress, which ran for more than an hour and a half, President Donald Trump made a series of claims about the state of the US under his predecessor Joe Biden and the achievements of his first weeks in office.\n\nHe returned to key campaign themes including illegal immigration, rising prices and what he called \"appalling waste\" in government spending.\n\n Verify has looked into the facts behind some of his key claims.\n\nDid Trump inherit an economic catastrophe?\n\nTrump said he inherited an \"economic catastrophe\" from Biden.\n\nThis is misleading. The US economy was growing at an annual rate of 2.3% in the final quarter of 2024 under the previous administration. It expanded by 2.8% over 2024 as a whole according to official US statistics.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund estimates that the US growth rate in 2024 was faster than any other nation in the G7.\n\nOn rising prices, Trump added \"we suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country\".\n\nInflation under Biden peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 - the highest level since 1981 - so not quite as far back as Trump claimed.\n\nThe 2022 peak was in the context of high inflation in the rest of the world in the wake of the Covid pandemic and a global energy shock. The inflation rate had dropped to 3% by the time Trump took office.\n\nInflation has also been much higher than 9% at several other points in US history, including the 1940s and 1920s.\n\nDid Biden let egg prices get out of control?\n\nTrump went on to blame Biden for egg prices, claiming he \"let the price of eggs get out of control\".\n\nPrices are high, but this has been linked to a bird flu outbreak in the US.\n\nEgg prices rose under Biden in 2023, and in January a dozen eggs averaged over $5, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). That is 53% above the average for the whole of 2024.\n\nThe USDA has said a bird flu outbreak has led to US farmers having to kill millions of chickens, creating egg shortages, and has announced a $1bn (\u00a3780m) plan to help combat the issue.\n\nThe outbreak started in February 2022 and last year the Biden administration allocated more than $800m to tackle it.\n\nThe Trump administration recently fired a number of USDA officials who worked on the government's response to bird flu as part of cost-cutting measures by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). They are now reportedly attempting to rehire some of them.\n\nHas Doge found hundreds of billions in fraud?\n\nTrump praised Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) and claimed the advisory body had found \"hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud\" in federal government spending.\n\nNo evidence has been provided for this figure.\n\nOn its official website, Doge states that it has saved an estimated $105bn, from fraud detection, contract and grant cancellations, real estate lease terminations, asset sales, workforce reductions, programmatic changes, and regulatory savings.\n\nHowever, that figure cannot be independently verified as, so far, Doge has only published \"receipts\" for contract, grant and real estate lease cancellations on the website. These add up to about $18.6bn. We have asked the White House for evidence of the remaining $86bn of savings.\n\nUS media outlets have also highlighted some accounting errors. For example, Doge initially listed its largest saving of $8bn from scrapping an immigration agency contract - it later corrected this to $8m.\n\nWas February the lowest ever month for border crossings?\n\nSpeaking about his actions to tackle illegal immigration, Trump said that \"as a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded\".\n\nThis is true.\n\nIn February 2025, 8,326 encounters of migrants at the south-west border with Mexico were recorded by US Border Patrol.\n\nThis is the lowest level since monthly records began in 2000.\n\nBy comparison, there were 140,641 encounters by US Border Patrol at this border in February last year under Biden.\n\nNumbers fell to 47,316 in December 2024.\n\nDid 21 million migrants enter US under Biden?\n\nContinuing with illegal migration, Trump claimed: \"Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States\".\n\nThere is no evidence for a figure this high.\n\nEncounters with migrants at the borders - a measure of illegal migration - reached 10 million under Biden but this does not mean this many people stayed in the US.\n\nIt is impossible to know exactly how many illegal immigrants have come to the US, as many will have evaded law enforcement agencies, but several estimates put the number at around half what Trump stated.\n\nA report published by the Office of Homeland Security last year estimated the number of illegal immigrants living in the US, as of January 2022, at 11 million.\n\nIt says about a fifth of them arrived in 2010 or later but the majority arrived before this time, some as early as the 1980s.\n\nHas the US spent $350bn on Ukraine?\n\nCorrection: an earlier version of this article stated that migrant encounters at the south-west border fell to 96,000 at the end of 2024. While this is correct for overall encounters here, the number recorded by Border Patrol was 47,316.\n\nAdditional reporting by Shayan Sardarizadeh & Anthony Reuben.",

        "full_text": "President Donald Trump is escalating his multi-front assault on what supporters see as an elite establishment, using raw presidential power to bend the government, law, media, public health, foreign policy, education and even the arts to his will.\n\nTrump left no doubt in last year\u2019s campaign that he\u2019d use executive authority to seek retribution against his political enemies. But his attempt to transform America\u2019s politics and culture is far broader than a personal revenge trip.\n\nHe\u2019s targeting Ivy League universities; using executive authority against top law firms; eviscerating the bureaucracy; rejecting 80 years of elite orthodoxy about American global leadership; and using tariffs to shatter the global trading system that Make America Great Again proponents regard as the self-enriching treachery of global elites.\n\nIn one recent example, the White House forced Columbia University to restrict demonstrations, review its Middle East curriculum, ban masks in protests and stiffen law enforcement. Other top educational institutions now feel vulnerable to possible attempts to impose Trump dogma. The strategy may widen the political opening created by conservative pressure on top colleges over anti-Israel protests amid the war in Gaza.\n\nAnd late last week, Trump directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek sanctions against lawyers and law firms who engage in what he regards as \u201cfrivolous, unreasonable, and vexatious litigation against the United States.\u201d The memo was released after he canceled punishment against one top white-collar firm after the White House said it agreed to do $40 million in pro bono legal services to support administration initiatives and promised to drop diversity, equity and inclusion. The firm \u2014 Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison \u2014 disputes the administration\u2019s characterization of the agreement, but the deal caused a backlash among many Washington lawyers.\n\nTrump\u2019s broad strategy pulsates with the anti-establishment energy that animated his rowdy campaign rallies, and is part of a deeper attempt to destroy what critics see as a liberal in-crowd that dominates Washington governance and global power in the West with what many conservatives see as more authentic American values. This aspiration lies behind the president\u2019s gutting of the Department of Education, which has long been viewed by Republicans as a tool of Democratic-backed teachers\u2019 unions and a lever for more inclusive gender, race and inclusion policies that many conservatives oppose.\n\nTrump\u2019s choice of education secretary, Linda McMahon \u2014 who lacks background in the field but made a fortune promoting theatrical, choreographed bouts of professional wrestling \u2014 is itself a rebuke to the education establishment. McMahon explained her mission to downgrade her department to \u2019s Dana Bash Sunday on \u201cState of the Union\u201d: \u201cThe Department of Education does not educate one child. It does not establish any curriculum in any states. It doesn\u2019t hire teachers. It doesn\u2019t establish programs,\u201d she said, vowing to send federal funds directly to states.\n\nMcMahon\u2019s appointment springs from the same elite-bashing sentiments that led Trump to name Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic, to head the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nTrump is trying to change America\u2019s culture as well as its politics\n\nTrump\u2019s politics has long been hostile to intellectualism. And a president who was mocked by the establishment for years is now using his second administration to settle scores.\n\nBut his attempt to bring universities, the media and the medical establishment into line is raising fears for academic and press freedom and the sanctity of science in public health. And his ambitions go further \u2014 he\u2019s even taken control of the Kennedy Center in Washington, put anchors on its board and promised to replace high culture with more mainstream programming.\n\nThis is all consistent with a president who draws most support from outside America\u2019s cities and wealthy middle-class suburbs; and who believes he has a mandate for transformation after winning all seven swing states and the popular vote in 2024. It also speaks to the revolution he led in the Republican Party, which has shed its establishment past and now channels working-class constituencies that used to be Democratic.\n\nBut the administration\u2019s latest actions also have dark parallels to the tactics of strongman leaders whose assaults on academia, the media, the law, and business led to the shriveling of basic freedoms, democracy and the proliferation of oligarchical corruption \u2014 for instance in Hungary under Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, a hero of the MAGA movement.\n\nTrump\u2019s ultra-nationalist instincts and admiration for dictators such as Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 a rebuke to generations of US establishment foreign policy directed against Kremlin expansionism \u2014 is calling into doubt the international system built by national security elites after World War II and the system of alliances with democracies that are the foundation of US global power.\n\nAnd his administration\u2019s insistence that what it regards as an elite liberal corps of district court judges don\u2019t have the right to interpret the Constitution in a way that constrains the power of an all-powerful president is now encroaching on the rule of law in America, even if the White House is yet to challenge the Supreme Court \u2014 perhaps in the belief that its conservative majority will validate some of the president\u2019s own worldview.\n\nHow the MAGA project believes leftist elites compromise American greatness\n\nTrump sketched out his approach in multiple policy areas in his searing inaugural address, which was a statement of intent to ensure his second term will impose the kind of fundamental change that his first failed to enshrine and of the belief that he was \u201csaved by God to make America great again.\u201d\n\nIn Trump\u2019s eyes, that greatness has been compromised by leftist elite policies that shattered domestic manufacturing, suppressed freedom with public health mandates, inflicted radical liberal values in education, allowed unchecked migration, caused weakness abroad and allowed America\u2019s friends to exploit its generosity. \u201cFor many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair,\u201d Trump said after he was sworn in.\n\nHis program mirrors the goals of Project 2025, the playbook for conservative presidential leadership that Trump disowned during his campaign but that now helps explain the policy decisions of his administration. \u201cThe next conservative president must possess the courage to relentlessly put the interests of the everyday American over the desires of the ruling elite,\u201d Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts wrote in the foreword of the document. \u201cTheir outrage cannot be prevented; it must simply be ignored, and it can be.\u201d\n\nThe synergy between Trump\u2019s desire to punish sources of power that he believes have wronged him and the wider administration attempt to neutralize any attempt to neutralize constraints drove his showdown with big law firms Paul, Weiss. The president signed an executive order that suspended security clearances for the firm\u2019s attorneys \u2014 a move that could have hampered its capacity to do act in cases that intersect with the federal government. The order was consistent with the president\u2019s attempt to end what he calls the \u201cweaponization\u201d of justice \u2014 by targeting lawyers or firms that previously took part in prosecutions against him.\n\nIn a letter to Paul, Weiss employees, the firm\u2019s chairman Brad Karp explained his decision to deal with the president, warning that the executive order could have \u201ceasily have destroyed our firm. It brought the full weight of the government down on our firm, our people, and our clients.\u201d\n\nBut the company\u2019s decision provoked wider worries that the president will use his power to threaten law firms with ruin if they act on behalf of his opponents.\n\nAdministration claims liberal judges are illegitimate\n\nTrump\u2019s attempts to bring legal elites in private firms to heel mirror his assault on another establishment the president is trying to disempower \u2014 the federal judiciary. This is highlighted by his attacks on a US federal judge who sought to halt deportations of alleged gang members that the White House carried out under the rarely used Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Judge James Boasberg is trying to find out whether the administration flouted his orders to halt the deportations last weekend. His efforts have sparked the extraordinary spectacle of an attorney general directly attacking his legitimacy.\n\n\u201cThis is an out-of-control judge, a federal judge trying to control our entire foreign policy. And he cannot do it,\u201d Bondi said on \u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures,\u201d which is presented by Maria Bartiromo \u2014 one of the Fox anchors Trump elevated to the board of the Kennedy Center. \u201cThey\u2019re not immigrants. They\u2019re illegal aliens who are committing the most violent crimes you can imagine on Americans, murder, rapes,\u201d Bondi said of Venezuelans deported to a draconian El Salvador prison run by dictator Nayib Bukele, which has raised human rights concerns.\n\nThe administration\u2019s use of a national security argument as justification for the deportations, which Trump claims are part of a Venezuelan invasion, may be designed to chill the judge\u2019s attempts to gain clarity. While Bondi said those deported were criminals, the administration has so far not provided any case-by-case details on those involved. has so far been unable to establish that any of the migrants belonged to the Tren de Aragua gang, which the administration said was the reason for the deportations.\n\nTrump\u2019s aides keep arguing that Boasberg is a liberal judge. But he was first appointed by Republican President George W. Bush and then promoted by President Barack Obama. He has a long reputation as a nonpartisan judge. The claims that only Trump-appointed judges are fit to rule on Trump administration policies threaten to destroy the foundation of the legal system.\n\nThe deportations are one of the most prominent examples of the administration\u2019s habit to applying vast executive power in an apparent attempt to outrun the capacity of the courts or its political opponents to impose constraints in real time.\n\nBut the ambition of leaving existing sources of elite power in Washington in tatters runs through all of the administration\u2019s goals \u2014 from the seizure of control of the White House press pool from journalists to include pro-Trump outlets to trashing generations of US bipartisan policy with threats to annex Canada while officials repeatedly parrot Russian propaganda on Ukraine.",

        "full_text": "Speaker Mike Johnson pulled off a stunning turnaround Tuesday night to rescue a critical vote to advance President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda that had seemed doomed just moments earlier.\n\nSurprising even some of his critics, Johnson and his leadership team capped hours of drama in the Capitol by successfully flipping multiple Republican holdouts to pass a budget blueprint that will mark the first step toward moving Trump\u2019s ambitious agenda forward. With help from last-minute phone calls from Trump, GOP leaders spent all of Tuesday in a furious pressure campaign to win backing for their plan.\n\n\u201cThe world didn\u2019t end today. But I do see the edge,\u201d Rep. Pat Fallon, a Texas Republican, said of the whiplash in the House.\n\nRepublicans had punted the vote Tuesday night only to turn around minutes later to call fleeing members back to the floor to muscle through the plan.\n\nIn the end, Johnson lost just a single vote \u2014 fiscal hawk Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky \u2014 which was all he could afford. The Democrats\u2019 whip team scrambled to get near-full attendance on their side: Rep. Brittany Pettersen flew with her 4-week-old baby to make it in time for the vote and Rep. Kevin Mullin, who is recovering from complications from knee surgery, flew with an IV from California.\n\nBut the drama won\u2019t end there: Johnson and his allies acknowledge that what comes next will be much more difficult. Tuesday night\u2019s vote itself was procedural and GOP leaders from the House and Senate will need to agree on how exactly to move ahead with Trump\u2019s sprawling legislative package now that they have adopted divergent plans. The days-long saga over the House budget blueprint laid bare bitter divisions among Republicans that will make it extraordinarily difficult to pass that package in both chambers.\n\nStill, the win comes at a critical time for Trump and Johnson as their party faces crushing deadlines ahead, including avoiding a government shutdown next month and the threat of an economic default later this spring. As with Tuesday night\u2019s vote, navigating those political landmines will require near total unity from the GOP.\n\nGOP leaders will now get to work on exactly what will make it into Trump\u2019s first legislative package. The newly passed House GOP plan calls for sweeping tax cuts, steep spending cuts and a two-year debt limit hike, as well as new money for border security and energy production. The Senate\u2019s plan, however, contains only national security and energy money, while punting on the more contentious items for later.\n\nThe stakes are high for GOP leaders: Trump is eager to pass his agenda as quickly as possible, even as party leaders must comply with the extremely strict constraints of the budget powers that allow their party to pass a package without Democratic votes. And Republicans will need to tread carefully on reforms to popular programs like Medicaid, food assistance and Pell grants \u2014 concerns that nearly sunk the budget plan this week.\n\nThe successful vote capped a dramatic 12 hours for Johnson. In the morning, he held a tense meeting with House Republicans to convince his members to back the budget blueprint or risk forgoing key parts of Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nBut by the afternoon, House GOP leaders were still struggling to lock down the votes, and even the relentlessly upbeat Johnson acknowledged he may need to pull it.\n\nThe votes weren\u2019t there around 7:30 p.m., when the speaker moved to scrap plans to hold the vote at all. But then his leadership team \u2014 with help from a Trump call to Rep. Victoria Spartz \u2014 was able to win over the last holdouts. So, just moments after dismissing members, Johnson called them back to vote and passed the GOP\u2019s budget blueprint.\n\nRep. Warren Davidson, an Ohio Republican, said he decided to change his vote after he received \u201cassurances\u201d of a future plan that could survive the Senate to trim discretionary spending, though he offered no specifics.\n\nAnd Spartz added that she spoke with Trump on health care issues, saying, \u201cHe\u2019s on board to get some great things done on health care. \u2026 I trust his word.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the last few weeks are showing us how difficult it is to move any package through the House,\u201d Rep. Dusty Johnson, a leadership ally, acknowledged earlier Tuesday. \u201cThis is a motley crew.\u201d\n\nHours before the scheduled vote, hardline conservatives insisted there weren\u2019t enough spending cuts in the plan, even as centrist-leaning Republicans remained uneasy about the size of those cuts and whether they could impact popular programs like Medicaid. And Johnson\u2019s efforts to win support even backfired in some corners. Massie said he left a meeting Tuesday morning even more dug in against the budget than before.\n\n\u201cThey convinced me in there, I\u2019m a no,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said, holding up a thick packet of leadership talking points and railing against their plans line by line. By the time of the vote, Massie remained the only GOP \u201cno.\u201d\n\nJohnson and his whip team had spent the last several days trying to win over their more moderate members, many of whom had raised concerns that the budget plan could ultimately lead to cuts to the low-income health program Medicaid.\n\nAhead of the vote, Republicans from northeastern states were particularly wary of plans to cut $880 billion over a decade from federal health and energy programs, which they fear cannot be achieved without cutting Medicaid, the hugely expensive health program, since Trump has vowed not to touch Medicare.\n\nGOP leaders have strongly pushed back against the idea that benefits would be cut, noting that the budget plan is only a framework and not specific policy. They argue there are ways to cut hundreds of billions in wasted money on federal health programs without slashing Medicaid benefits, though it remains unclear where those cuts would come from.\n\n\u201cThis is a procedural vote. You tell me what the cuts are,\u201d House Majority Whip Tom Emmer told when asked about swing seat lawmakers\u2019 concerns about Medicaid cuts.\n\nIn the end, Johnson only recorded a single Republican defection.\n\n\u201cWe will get there, as we always do,\u201d the speaker predicted earlier in the day, when he was still lacking at least a half-dozen votes.\n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments.\n\n\u2019s Manu Raju, Alison Main, Morgan Rimmer, Veronica Stracqualursi and Aileen Graef contributed to this report.",

        "full_text": "US stocks slid Monday as investors braced for President Donald Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico to go into effect by the midnight deadline.\n\nThe Dow tumbled 650 points, or 1.48%, to close at 43,191. The Dow fell almost 900 points in afternoon trading before pulling back slightly. The broader S&P 500 fell 1.76% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.64%.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted its biggest one-day decline of the year. The Nasdaq is down about 6.5% since since Trump took office on January 20.\n\n\u201cTomorrow, tariffs \u2014 25% on Canada and 25% on Mexico,\u201d Trump said during a press conference at the White House. \u201cAnd that\u2019ll start. \u2026 What they have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United States, in which case they have no tariffs.\u201d\n\nTrump said the two trading partners had \u201cno room\u201d left to negotiate to avoid the levies and that he was using tariffs to \u201cpunish\u201d countries that, as he put it, were taking from the US economy without giving enough in return.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all set. They go into effect tomorrow,\u201d he said.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Ottawa would immediately respond with tariffs on $30 billion of US goods if the Trump administration\u2019s measures go into effect.\n\n\u201cCanada will not let this unjustified decision go unanswered,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nTrump also signed an executive order on Monday raising tariffs on imports from China to 20%, up from 10%. Trump said the tariffs, aimed at bringing China to the table on curtailing fentanyl entering the United States, will be raised because Beijing has not done enough to stem the flow of illegal drugs.\n\nThe VIX, Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, surged to its highest point this year after Trump\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cDue to the uncertainty surrounding the tariffs, the stock market has erased the gains from the \u2018Trump bump\u2019 following the presidential election and the expected upward pressure on prices is giving investors pause,\u201d said Gustavo Flores-Macias, a professor of government and public policy at Cornell University.\n\n\u201cFor investors, 2025 can still be a positive year for stocks, but it may take all year to realize gains. And they may be modest,\u201d said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still a bull,\u201d Bolvin said.\n\nThe import taxes Trump imposed are significant \u2014 the largest in US-China history. The initial tariffs, which went into effect February 4, set in motion tariffs on $1.4 trillion of imported goods. That\u2019s more than triple the $380 billion worth of foreign goods that were hit with tariffs during Trump\u2019s first term, according to estimates from the Tax Foundation.\n\nChinese response\n\nA spokesperson for China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said Tuesday the country was \u201cstrongly dissatisfied\u201d and \u201cfirmly opposed\u201d the additional tariff.\n\n\u201c(China) will take countermeasures to firmly safeguard its own rights and interests,\u201d the spokesperson added in a statement.\n\nBefore he became president, Trump pledged a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods, so the tariff level could rise still.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said at the press conference about tariffs on Canada and Mexico that global companies can avoid tariffs if they invest into production in the United States, like TSMC, the Taiwanese chipmaker at the White House on Monday to announce a $100 billion US investment.\n\nTrump\u2019s tariffs will raise prices of imported goods, which could boost demand for goods produced in the US, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs. But they also noted that tariffs will have negative effects on some American businesses.\n\n\u201cTariff increases will also raise production costs for some domestic producers and will likely prompt foreign retaliation against some US exports, both of which could hurt domestic production,\u201d they wrote in a note.\n\nUS stocks are \u201clikely to be volatile\u201d until Trump\u2019s policies point toward being more growth-focused, said Jason Draho, head of asset allocation for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note Monday.\n\nDraho said he does expect future growth and maintains a \u201cpositive medium-term outlook.\u201d\n\n\u2018Extreme fear\u2019\n\nThe stock market began to slide Monday morning to begin the new month, as investors digested the latest manufacturing survey from the Institute for Supply Management. The survey showed economic activity in the manufacturing industry remained in expansion territory, yet slowed last month. Tariff fears dominated write-in responses to the survey.\n\nMarkets slid Monday afternoon after Trump posted on Truth Social that he plans to implement tariffs on \u201cexternal product[s],\u201d potentially including agricultural products. Trump\u2019s post referred to his plan for reciprocal tariffs, set to take place on April 2, according to a person familiar, though it was not immediately clear how these tariffs would be implemented.\n\n\u201cTo the Great Farmers of the United States: Get ready to start making a lot of agricultural product to be sold INSIDE of the United States. Tariffs will go on external product on April 2nd. Have fun!\u201d Trump said in the post.\n\nThe sentiment driving markets on Monday dipped into \u201cextreme fear\u201d after Trump\u2019s confirmation that tariffs will go into effect on Tuesday, according to \u2019s Fear and Greed Index.\n\nThe stocks dragging markets lower on Monday included Nvidia (NVDA), which fell 8.7%.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury slid to 4.16%, signaling concerns about uncertainty and future economic growth.\n\nBitcoin traded around $85,600 on Monday afternoon, down 8.6% in the past day and largely erasing gains made after Trump on Sunday announced a strategic crypto reserve that would include bitcoin.\n\nMeanwhile, shares in defense companies in Europe soared to record highs on Monday as European leaders consider the need to re-arm amid less US support for Ukraine.",

        "full_text": "Personnel from the Department of Government Efficiency, accompanied by DC police officers, gained access to the US Institute of Peace Monday after being turned away last week.\n\nThe dramatic escalation follows the Trump administration\u2019s Friday gutting of the organization\u2019s board and tees up another court fight between the administration and an independent organization.\n\n\u201cDOGE has broken into our building,\u201d acting USIP president George Moose, whom the Trump administration said has been fired from the role, said in a statement Monday.\n\nThe administration fired most of USIP\u2019s board on Friday and its three remaining members \u2013 Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Defense University President Peter Garvin \u2013 said they were installing Kenneth Jackson as acting USIP president. Jackson was among the personnel who entered the building on Monday, according to the institute\u2019s chief security officer.\n\nUSIP does not see that appointment as legal. The institute, which works to resolve conflict, is not a federal agency. It was created by Congress as a nonpartisan, independent body in 1984, and USIP owns and manages its headquarters.\n\nAccording to USIP\u2019s chief security officer Colin O\u2019Brien, the organization on Monday called the DC Metropolitan Police after former security contractors, whose contracts were suspended Sunday, entered the building without permission.\n\nWhen he went to greet the police, O\u2019Brien recounted, \u201cthey held the door open and allowed members of DOGE to enter the building, where they were also followed by 10 to 12 police officers, uniformed DC police officers.\u201d\n\nThose DOGE personnel, most of whom O\u2019Brien said would not identify themselves, told him, USIP\u2019s general counsel and members of the operations staff to exit the building, he said.\n\nMore police officers arrived later in the day with lock-picking devices and were seen entering a side door of the building.\n\nIn a post on X, DOGE alleged that Moose \u201cdenied lawful access to Kenneth Jackson, the Acting USIP President (as approved by the USIP Board).\u201d DOGE said DC police \u201carrived onsite and escorted Mr. Jackson into the building.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only unlawful individual was Mr. Moose, who refused to comply, and even tried to fire USIP\u2019s private security team when said security team went to give access to Mr. Jackson,\u201d DOGE said in the post, which linked to a memo from the three Trump officials appointing Jackson as acting president.\n\nA DC police spokesperson told that the police department responded to an unlawful entry report at USIP. \u201cIndividuals who were asked to leave by the management at that facility left,\u201d they said. \u201cThere were no arrests made and no incidents to report.\u201d\n\nSome USIP officials remained in the building after DOGE\u2019s arrival, including Moose, a retired career diplomat. He was later forced to exit the building by DC police.\n\nIn an interview done by phone from his locked office as DOGE went through the building, Moose said he had expected DOGE would return to try to gain access to USIP.\n\nOver the weekend, he said, \u201crepresentatives of the FBI and of the US Attorney\u2019s Office of the District of Columbia were approaching members of our staff and our workforce to try to intimidate their way into getting into the building.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had not expected that the FBI would succeed in enlisting the support and collaboration of the District of Columbia police, with whom we have had a great relationship,\u201d Moose said. \u201cSomehow, FBI has managed to convince the DC police that this is a building that is owned by the US government and not by the US Institute of Peace.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien told that the FBI called him over the weekend, and two FBI agents went to the home of one of his security officers.\n\nThe FBI referred a request for comment to the DOJ. has reached out to the Department of Justice.\n\nMoose said that USIP plans to fight the DOGE moves \u201cvigorously\u201d in court.\n\n\u201cWe are confident of our legal status, and we are confident that a court that gives us a hearing will be persuaded by the strength of our legal argument,\u201d Moose said after departing the building.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the first building I\u2019ve been called upon to try to defend. We\u2019ve had to defend embassies all around the world, in Africa, where I spent most of my career in pursuit of our mission,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is obviously, this is not a great day for this. This is not a happy day for anybody that somehow, this misunderstanding of our intent, our purpose has reached a point where folks are going to come and try it.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Rep. Don Beyer, who arrived on the scene later in the evening Monday, said he\u2019ll \u201creport back to House leadership\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019ll try to do something in the US Congress.\u201d\n\n\u201cUSIP is a congressionally chartered nonprofit. It is not a federal agency. We think it\u2019s clearly illegal and unconstitutional for DOGE to be taking it over,\u201d he told .\n\nO\u2019Brien, the chief security officer, said he had never experienced anything like Monday\u2019s events in his tenure at USIP.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing,\u201d he told . \u201cWhen you look at the mission of the United States Institute of Peace, its job is to prevent Americans from getting into costly wars. It\u2019s to bring peace, and our president has said he wants to be a peacemaker, and we are ready, willing and able to assist with that mission.\u201d",

The parts being blocked include its limitations on government contracts with clients of the firm and the potential restrictions it puts on the firm\u2019s employees, such as bans on hiring those employees for government positions or barring their access to federal buildings.\n\nThe executive order, Howell said as she read her opinion in court for more than 30 minutes, is \u201ca punishment for a singled-out entity being disloyal.\u201d\n\nWhen \u201cthe Queen of Hearts yells \u2018off with their heads\u2019 for her subjects,\u201d Howell added, that \u201ccannot be the reality we are living under.\u201d\n\nThe judge, an appointee of President Barack Obama, said the case also touches on larger tests of Trump\u2019s executive authority. The executive order, she said, is an unconstitutional use of \u201ctaxpayer dollars and government resources \u2026 to pursue a personal vendetta.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president is certainly entitled to his own beliefs, entitled to his own causes, and entitled to his own dislikes,\u201d Howell said. But the president cannot \u201cbring the federal government down on his political opponents \u2026 as he has done here.\u201d\n\n\u2018Chilling effect\u2019 to legal system\n\nThe judge also said she was blocking much of Trump\u2019s order because of the economic harm it would cause to the law firm \u2014 and the intimidating message it sent across legal industry.\n\nHowell said the order was an \u201cextreme, unprecedented effort\u201d and had an effect of \u201cblizzard proportions across the legal profession.\u201d\n\nDelivering her decision from the bench, Howell said the justice system depends on zealous advocates on all sides being able to argue for their clients.\n\n\u201cThe chilling effect of this executive order, 14230, threatens to significantly undermine the integrity of our entire legal system,\u201d she said.\n\nDOJ argues Trump should be trusted without question\n\nThe ruling came at the end of a hearing where the top aide to the attorney general argued that the president should be trusted without question if he wants to blacklist or sanction businesses or people as he sees fit across the country.\n\nThe argument from Chad Mizelle, the chief of staff to Attorney General Pam Bondi, is one of staggering presidential power.\n\nHowell was flabbergasted by Mizelle\u2019s argument, saying it sent \u201cchills down my spine\u201d to hear the president could bar all government business with a particular company or person. Howell compared that type of decision by the president to Treasury Department economic sanctions that are decided by the Office of Foreign Assets Control related to national security.\n\n\u201cYour view is, \u2018Don\u2019t be chilled, judge. You can just trust the president to draw the right line, and yes, he has that power?\u2019\u201d Howell asked. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the government\u2019s position here?\u201d\n\n\u201c100 percent,\u201d Mizelle said. \u201cThe president has every right to take that action.\u201d\n\nMizelle also argued the courts shouldn\u2019t be able to limit the president\u2019s authority, especially as he decides upon lawyers\u2019 security clearances or other access questions related to national security.\n\nPerkins Coie\u2019s lawyer Dane Butswinkas, however, said that the national security argument is a red herring, and the Trump administration\u2019s approach refers to \u201ca different Constitution from the one I\u2019m familiar with.\u201d\n\nThe firm says the order will cause top clients to drop its lawyers, and ultimately \u201cwill spell the end of the law firm,\u201d Butswinkas said. \u201cThe president is punishing this law firm\u201d for defending free speech.\n\nHe said that Justice Department prosecutors have canceled meetings with Perkins Coie lawyers, hurting their ability to represent clients in ongoing legal matters.\n\nHowell also said she was blocking Trump\u2019s order because it appears to violate several Constitutional protections, including the right for defendants to choose their lawyers, and the First Amendment right to petition the government. Perkins Coie also had no warning of the executive order or chance to oppose it before the White House issued it last Thursday, violating their due process, the judge added.\n\n\u2019s Emily R.

        "full_text": "\u200bPatrick Healy, the deputy Opinion editor, hosted an online conversation with four Times Opinion columnists about the Trump administration\u2019s popularity among Republicans and why so many in the party believe the country is heading in the right direction.\n\nPatrick Healy: David, Bret, David, Ross: Donald Trump is the only president in our lifetimes who\u2019s had a net-negative job approval rating in his first 100 days in office. Trump also has the largest gap in approval ratings in 80 years \u2014 90 percent of Republicans like his performance, while only 4 percent of Democrats do. Those Trump supporters are really on board with him; more registered voters think America is on the right track than at any point since 2004, according to a new News poll. To be clear, a majority still say America\u2019s on the wrong track, and Trump\u2019s polling on the economy is sagging. But I want to dig into why more voters feel better about America\u2019s direction now than compared with under Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Trump 1.0.\n\nAnd I wanted to do so through the eyes of my more conservative colleagues. The four of you span the ideological spectrum on the right, and you\u2019ve all written extensively about Trump. Why do so many Republicans like the direction Trump is taking the country in? Is it about his style, or his policies, or the mind-set and mood of the G.O.P., or something else?\n\nDavid Brooks: I\u2019d start with the world we\u2019ve been living in for the last decade or so. According to an Ipsos survey last year, 59 percent of Americans think our country is in decline. Sixty percent believe \u201cthe system is broken.\u201d Sixty-nine percent believe the \u201cpolitical and economic elite don\u2019t care about hard-working people.\u201d If those are your priors, then you\u2019re going to be happy with a president who wields a wrecking ball.\n\nHealy: As Trump liked to say while campaigning, \u201cWhat the hell do you have to lose?\u201d\n\nBrooks: I\u2019d add another phrase: \u201cbrokenism.\u201d This is the belief system popularized by Alana Newhouse in Tablet magazine in 2022. It\u2019s the idea that everything is broken and we just need to burn it all down. Personally, I think some things are broken and some things are OK, but most of my Trump-supporting friends are brokenists. They get this from media consumption. Do you remember that 2013 study that people who consumed a lot of media about the Boston Marathon bombing experienced \u201chigher acute stress\u201d than those who were actually at the bombing? There\u2019s something about screens that contributes to a catastrophizing mind-set.\n\nDavid French: In addition to the brokenism that David talks about, there\u2019s a strong undercurrent of raw animosity in our politics. Republicans and Democrats have very negative views of each other, and many Republicans (sadly!) want their opponents to suffer. They\u2019re actually happy to see people lose their jobs or to see nonprofits lose funding if those people are perceived as part of the \u201cdeep state\u201d or RINOs.\n\nSo, yes, Republicans want a disruptive president, but who\u2019s being disrupted really matters \u2014 and if it\u2019s the government or institutions that many Republicans believe are hostile to them, then Republicans are just fine with the pain. Many Republicans dislike foreign aid. Or loathe elite universities. Or hate big liberal law firms. Students and professors at elite universities have a long track record of targeting the free speech rights of their conservative colleagues, and Republicans are rationalizing their own constitutional violations as fighting fire with fire.\n\nHealy: That element of gleeful animosity comes through on Trump\u2019s social media posts, David \u2014 like a \u201cTake that!\u201d smack, sticking it to universities or shutting down D.E.I. One of Trump\u2019s most effective rallying cries in the last campaign was \u201cI am your retribution.\u201d\n\nRoss Douthat: I think there are all kinds of ways in which Trump\u2019s popularity is connected to distinctive shifts in the culture in the last 15 years \u2014 the trends on both left and right that have boosted populists all over the Western world. But it\u2019s also important to stress that part of what Republicans like about Donald Trump is just that Donald Trump is a Republican.\n\nHis biggest policy accomplishment so far is shutting down illegal immigration \u2014 something Republican voters strongly support. His signature legislative goal is extending his first-term tax cuts \u2014 a classic Republican policy goal. He wants to fire federal bureaucrats, downsize and devolve the Department of Education, cut regulations \u2014 this isn\u2019t some populist rebuke of Ronald Reagan\u2019s conservatism, this IS Ronald Reagan\u2019s conservatism! So is picking fights with liberal judges and liberal universities. And if you told someone in, say, 2004 that a Republican president was stretching the boundaries of civil liberties to deport noncitizens accused of sympathizing with Hamas and Hezbollah, absolutely nobody would regard his popularity with G.O.P. voters as a puzzle in need of explanation.\n\nThere are important ways in which Trump\u2019s style and tactics and some of his policy goals \u2014 the trade and tariff agenda, above all; foreign policy to some degree \u2014 are not old-school Republican politics as usual. But we shouldn\u2019t exaggerate the break or make a deep mystery of why Republican voters would react favorably to much of what he\u2019s doing.\n\nBret Stephens: Patrick, Alexander Hamilton supplied one part of the answer in Federalist No. 70: \u201cEnergy in the executive is a leading character in the definition of good government.\u201d So leave to one side questions about what Trump is doing. What most Americans notice is that Trump is doing: bombing the Houthis, tariffing our neighbors, strong-arming President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, threatening Hamas, abolishing U.S.A.I.D. He\u2019s the guy supporters and opponents alike struggle to keep pace with \u2014 while he grips their attention.\n\nA second part \u2014 and this is especially important for Trump critics like me to acknowledge \u2014 is that at least some of what he\u2019s doing is succeeding. It is important that we finally have regained control over the southern border \u2014 proving, if nothing else, that we aren\u2019t helpless in the face of these vast migratory flows. Getting rid of D.E.I. programs that had become a pervasive system of racial gerrymanders is, by my lights, another achievement. Demanding that Columbia University ban face-covering masks and enforce meaningful discipline on menacing and disruptive pro-Palestinian protesters in exchange for continued government funding strikes me as a good conclusion. And I really don\u2019t think the nation will miss the Department of Education when it\u2019s gone.\n\nBrooks: Bret, you now live in a country in which \u201ctariffing\u201d is a verb. I feel like this signifies the end of Western civilization. It started when consultants began using \u201clearnings\u201d as a noun. The path to perdition is slow, but accelerating.\n\nStephens: It\u2019s a legit verb, David. For realz.\n\nFrench: I\u2019m glad Bret brought up the border and the Houthis. These were two areas where the Biden administration failed (without good excuse), and the ease with which Trump pivoted to a different and better course highlights that many Democrats still don\u2019t quite understand how poorly the Biden administration performed in its approach to both crises.\n\nHealy: And you\u2019re seeing in poll numbers now that the Democratic Party is at a nadir in popularity. It boils down to trust, ideas and leadership.\n\nBrooks: I\u2019d offer up one more word for consideration: \u201cexclusion.\u201d Progressives really have spent the last few decades excluding conservative and working-class voices from a lot of institutions. Trump has gone after these institutions big time \u2014 the universities, the Department of Education, the State Department. Of course, the MAGA crowd feels justified revenge.\n\nStephens: An important point, David. I know liberals love to point out that MAGA politicians like Ted Cruz, Tom Cotton, Josh Hawley and Elise Stefanik all went to Ivy League schools (as did Donald Trump, though I doubt it was on account of merit). But those campus conservatives were always ideological minorities at elite colleges, and it\u2019s where they learned to loathe the contempt they felt coming from liberal professors and peers.\n\nDouthat: Fortunately, all of us have learned to rise above it instead.\n\nStephens: At the University of Chicago, Ross, I was almost a liberal. Almost. Relatively speaking.\n\nFrench: I never did, Ross. That\u2019s why I sued so many universities during my litigation career, but always with an eye toward protecting constitutional rights, not denying them to my political opponents.\n\nBrooks: A lot of elite conservatives continue to struggle with what I call the near-abroad problem. They may dislike MAGA, but they (we) are mostly around progressives or moderates on a day-to-day basis, by virtue of being elite. These progressives sometimes make our teeth hurt. We react more strongly to minor sins of the people across campus than the major sins of the people far away. This is something I\u2019m working on.\n\nHealy: I want to bear down on the idea that more Americans think the country is on the right track with Trump. I have three theories to stress-test with you \u2014 or else I want to hear your own.\n\nOne: Authoritarians are popular, until they aren\u2019t \u2014 that\u2019s how it works.\n\nTwo: The enthusiasm is a honeymoon stemming from the November election, where Democrats got a big comeuppance from Trump.\n\nThree: A lot of Americans think Trump is generally right in both his diagnosis and Rx of government \u2014 that nothing terribly bad is going to happen, that the State Department can run foreign aid and the Treasury and the states can run Education Department programs, that tariffs will be a net positive in the long run, and that for all the sound and fury (and illegality), Trump 2.0 is trying to help America avoid becoming like societies struggling with long-term decline, weak national identities and sclerotic economies.\n\nAnd I\u2019m open for business on a fourth theory, or more.\n\nDouthat: First, I would stress that Trump is not terribly popular, and undoubtedly will become less so if the stock market trends down and recession fears mount. He has a commanding position within his party, but even at his apotheosis his approval ratings barely got over 50 percent.\n\nSecond, Americans lived through the first Trump term, when sky-is-falling rhetoric was commonplace, but the average American did not experience a crisis until Covid hit. Then, through the Biden term, the media dialed back the crisis rhetoric dramatically, but in reality, inflation soared, the border seemed wide open, the world became much more dangerous, and the president was manifestly incapable of doing his job. So, while you can make a plausible case that this time is different, that Trump is more empowered and therefore more dangerous, you should still expect many Americans to wait for proof of that in their daily lives before they immediately re-embrace his first term\u2019s narrative of crisis.\n\nBrooks: I\u2019d take you back to a 1971 Clint Eastwood movie, \u201cDirty Harry,\u201d or a 1974 Charles Bronson movie, \u201cDeath Wish.\u201d Both of those were produced in a time of social decay, and they\u2019re both about a guy who is willing to break or bend the rules to restore order. To this day, there is a large chunk of Americans who think the system is so broken, we need someone who will break the rules. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening.\n\nPlus, the unfortunate fact is that there is almost always a kernel of truth to Trump & Co.\u2019s assaults. The most noxious thing they have done in my view is eviscerate U.S.A.I.D. Millions will die. But it was true that U.S.A.I.D. was a bureaucratic nightmare. A generation of administrators there tried to fix it. The problem \u2014 which the Trumpies don\u2019t understand \u2014 is that a lot of the sinecures were established by members of Congress who insisted they not be removed. Trump policies are not 100 percent wrong; they are just overreactions. Destroying an agency rather than fixing what is wrong and saving what is right.\n\nStephens: Unless you happen to live within a few miles of Capitol Hill, you probably don\u2019t give two figs whether our (sometimes misspent) foreign aid is distributed via a semiautonomous agency called U.S.A.I.D. or directly through the State Department itself. You also probably think it\u2019s no tragedy that government workers should experience the periodic layoffs that the rest of American workers have lived through since forever. The sort of inside-the-Beltway moves that feel like political earthquakes to a certain kind of Washington insider leave Trump voters somewhere between indifferent and pleased.\n\nThe other point that can\u2019t be emphasized enough: Trump wouldn\u2019t be as popular as he is with his side of the country if Democrats and progressives weren\u2019t as unpopular with most sides of the country. Just the fact that he drives the Rachel Maddows of the world into fits of rage and despair and thoughts of European exile is reason enough for many Americans to support him. Sometimes even including me.\n\nFrench: Those of us who follow politics closely always seem to forget that we\u2019re the strange ones. I really question how much the average rank-and-file Republican even knows about most of these early controversies. If you\u2019re watching or other right-wing outlets, you\u2019re hearing a lot of stories about strange, \u201cwoke\u201d programs funded by U.S.A.I.D. They don\u2019t know about the lives that are saved or the lives that are at risk.\n\nThat means they won\u2019t know, much less care, about any given political controversy until it affects them personally.\n\nHealy: I want to return to a word I used in the last question: illegality. Democrats and plenty of independents, and not a few judges, see illegality or evidence of it in some of Trump\u2019s actions on federal spending, agency dismantlement, deportations, defiance of judicial rulings. Why do some conservatives see illegality differently?\n\nDouthat: First, some of these moves are not obviously illegal, and exist in a zone of contestation over presidential power and constitutional interpretation where a normal partisan naturally takes his own side\u2019s side.\n\nHealy: We\u2019ll get to some specific moves a bit later. Go on.\n\nDouthat: Second, I would emphasize that many Americans experienced the recent period of liberal power, especially under Covidian conditions, as much more authoritarian and lawless-feeling in its everyday impact \u2014 schools closed and masks mandated, ideological double standards for different forms of public gathering and protest, ideological speech codes tacitly or explicitly imposed \u2014 than anything they experienced under Trump.\n\nThis sense of things may change as Trump pushes the envelope of presidential power or as the right embraces its own forms of censoriousness. Indeed, already you can see some factions that aligned with Trump because they were anti-woke start to break away or critique MAGA excesses.\n\nBut it\u2019s still important to grasp that for many Americans, the fights over presidential prerogatives within the federal bureaucracy feel much more distant from their own liberties than liberalism\u2019s recent agenda did.\n\nStephens: What I see is a president doing things that are, if not outright illegal, genuinely scary, like trying to go after the Washington law firm representing Jack Smith, the former special counsel. At a minimum, Trump represents an almost unprecedented stress test to the judicial system and the separation of powers. And if he starts openly defying Supreme Court rulings \u00e0 la Andrew Jackson, that\u2019s when you\u2019ll find me at the barricades.\n\nThat said, some of what Trump is doing is simply a turbocharged version of what his liberal predecessors did while the mainstream press remained mostly mum. Remember Barack Obama\u2019s threats of unilateral executive action through his phone and his pen? Or Joe Biden\u2019s almost open flouting of the Supreme Court with his student loan forgiveness schemes? I also think millions of Americans are tuning out some of the claims of Trump\u2019s unconstitutional behavior as so much partisan noise. That\u2019s one of the downsides of some of the more doubtful efforts by liberal prosecutors to put Trump in jail.\n\nFrench: First, I sincerely doubt that most Republicans think or believe that Trump has done anything illegal so far. Right-wing media is full of legal talking heads telling their loyal audiences that the various district judges are lawless. The right is even attacking Amy Coney Barrett, calling her a grifter or a RINO for exercising her independent judgment.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this pattern throughout the Trump years. Trump will advance an illegal or unconstitutional policy, MAGA lawyers will spring to MAGA media to rationalize and justify it, and then, when even conservative judges or justices block Trump\u2019s actions, they scream that the courts are lawless, not Trump.\n\nBrooks: As a matter of principle, Democrats should be screaming bloody murder about Trump\u2019s threat to the Constitution. As a matter of political tactics, I think they\u2019re better off emphasizing Trumpian incompetence. Determining the constitutionality of some act requires a law degree, but incompetence is something we all recognize \u2014 and there is a lot of it.\n\nHealy: On the economy, I ask in all seriousness: Are Republicans really OK if Trump drives America into a recession? Listening to Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, this week, stock market corrections are healthy and recessions may be sometimes necessary. Putting aside the macroeconomic finer points there, I\u2019m confused that so many Republicans think we\u2019re on the right track when that track may be leading to recession. Are they not paying attention?\n\nFrench: It\u2019s so important to distinguish between the core of MAGA \u2014 which dominates discourse online \u2014 from the bulk of voters who put Trump back in the White House. Online MAGA will pay any price and bear any burden for Trump; they\u2019ll even buy electric cars to keep the DOGE dream alive. But the people who actually made him president were primarily concerned about prices, and it wasn\u2019t close. If the economy tanks, MAGA will stay with Trump, but we know from the 2020 election that enough voters will step off the Trump train to swing the balance of power back to the Democrats.\n\nDouthat: It\u2019s not unique to MAGA, though \u2014 real partisans don\u2019t change their vote just because the economy goes bad, and especially not under polarized conditions. It\u2019s not like the inflation under Biden suddenly made partisan Democrats open to a vote for Trump. But as David says, Trump\u2019s current coalition includes a lot of not-that-partisan nonloyalists who voted for him because they thought he\u2019d be good for the economy, and those voters will be voting Democratic in the midterms without a second thought if we\u2019re in a recession.\n\nBrooks: I do think Trump\u2019s popularity will plummet if the economy really heads south. People will tolerate a lot from their government, but not unnecessary chaos.\n\nHealy: And not when Trump promised an economic boom from Day 1.\n\nBrooks: People forget how many voters like Trump mostly because he\u2019s a businessman who, they think, knows how to \u201cgrow the economy\u201d (speaking of words that should have never been verbs). If that myth is busted, things will head south fast. In fact, I worry the political momentum will shift so fast that the Democrats won\u2019t be ready to take advantage. They\u2019ll still be dealing with their own trauma, intellectual incoherence and recriminations. They won\u2019t have time to offer something new, which is why parties recently have not reformed themselves after defeat. The other side screws up too fast.\n\nStephens: Well, Treasury Secretary Bessent is right. Market corrections are healthy. Recessions should sometimes happen. Having the government or the Federal Reserve ensure that markets only go up is the road to inflating bubbles that ought to be pricked, and to zombifying large parts of the economy that ought to be allowed to die. The practice by presidents of both parties to ensure that profits are privatized and risk is socialized is a road to ruin.\n\nThe problem is, trying to go about this by jacking up tariffs in incoherent and unpredictable ways is the worst possible way of pricking bubbles. But I wouldn\u2019t be so sure that the economy is going to tank. Markets usually like deregulation, permitting reform, \u201cDrill, baby drill,\u201d an extension of the 2017 tax cuts. And Trump can always lift the tariffs. Like Soviet diplomacy under Andrei Gromyko, Trump has a gift for creating crises so that he can take credit for solving them.\n\nHealy: I\u2019d like to do a lightning round and go through actions Trump has taken and learn if you agree or disagree with each of them \u2014 to help readers understand how the four of you with histories on the right see these issues. First: Trump\u2019s negotiations with President Vladimir Putin of Russia to end the war in Ukraine.\n\nBrooks: Let\u2019s not overthink this \u2014 siding with a villainous dictator against a brave democrat is repulsive. That said, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to return to the postwar international order. The 21st century was bound to look a lot different from the 20th. Those of us internationalists have some thinking to do.\n\nDouthat: Negotiating with Putin in some form is an absolute strategic necessity, given the situation of the war and American power overall. Which doesn\u2019t mean that Trump will produce a good deal.\n\nFrench: Of all the outrages of Trump\u2019s first two months, his betrayal of Ukraine is likely to be the most consequential. If he continues on this course, he\u2019ll hand Russia a military victory, rip the heart out of the Western alliance, and place a diminished America in a bystander role as great power competition likely leads to nuclear proliferation and greater international instability.\n\nI agree with David that the 21st century is going to look different from the 20th. But this does not mean our alliances are somehow less valuable, and that it\u2019s better for America to alienate Europe for the sake of embracing Russia.\n\nWe should want the European powers to increase defense spending as partners and friends, not as angry, estranged former allies. We need their help.\n\nStephens: Trump at his absolute worst. A betrayal of the free world and its courageous champions in Ukraine. A betrayal of the promises of the Atlantic Charter and 80 years of American global leadership against totalitarian aggression. And a portent of betrayal for every other small country \u2014 whether it\u2019s Latvia, Taiwan or Israel \u2014 that looks to America for the protection of independence and liberty. I can only hope Putin\u2019s refusal to agree to a cease-fire does something to sober Trump\u2019s judgment.\n\nHealy: The federal government sending hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants to a prison in El Salvador, deciding they were gang members even as a federal judge was assessing their cases, and doing so even though the judge ordered the deportation flights to turn around and head back to the United States.\n\nStephens: I\u2019d need to learn a few more details, but it sounds legally iffy. Still, not the hill Trump\u2019s critics should want to die on.\n\nDouthat: Deporting gang leaders is good. But claiming wartime powers to go around the normal deportation system seems guaranteed \u2014 as in the War on Terror, to stress again Trump\u2019s continuity with past Republicans \u2014 to yield abuses and mistakes, and that may have already happened in this case.\n\nHealy: Trump calling for the impeachment of that judge \u2014 and the notion of impeaching or disregarding judges generally whom Trump disagrees with.\n\nStephens: Terrible. I only stop to observe that all the liberals who went berserk over John Roberts\u2019s nomination to the court 20 years ago owe the chief justice an apology, especially after his intervention in this case. He\u2019s a model of conservative jurisprudence.\n\nDouthat: Trump\u2019s rhetoric against his opponents, judicial or otherwise, always goes too far. But I think elected officials aggressively attacking judges who make aggressive rulings is a completely normal part of democratic politics in a country with a powerful judicial branch, and I would say the same about many sweeping liberal attacks on the Roberts court and its conservative justices in the last few years.\n\nBrooks: Atrocious. As usual, Trump is being patrimonialist \u2014 treating the U.S. government like his own family business.\n\nFrench: It\u2019s not just dreadful, but it\u2019s also part of a calculated attack on the role of the judiciary in the constitutional order. Russell Vought, Trump\u2019s influential head of Office of Management and Budget, has said that the right \u201cneeds to throw off the precedents and legal paradigms that have wrongly developed over the last 200 years, and to study carefully the words of the Constitution and how the founders would have responded in modern situations to the encroachments of other branches.\u201d\n\nBrooks: Pure cruelty. This is one of those issues where anecdotes prevail over reality. We need to be able to defeat China in a possible naval confrontation. Is this really what we should be thinking about?\n\nStephens: I don\u2019t think the military was \u201ccruel\u201d when transgender people were barred from military service for the first seven and a half years of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. This is an example of the deep disconnect between the moral certitudes of the part of the country that rarely serves in the military and the cultural convictions of the part of the country that often does \u2014 and on whom we all depend for our safety.\n\nFrench: I see the matter primarily as a question of readiness, not rights. Medical transitions can be very physically challenging, sometimes including physically debilitating treatments. That can affect readiness a great deal. In that circumstance, the question is less about transgender status and more about the physical realities of complex medical procedures.\n\nDouthat: I will just say that the policy seems to be obviously within the commander in chief\u2019s constitutional powers, and the judicial ruling to the contrary is a good example of why many conservatives don\u2019t feel they need to take the wider run of anti-Trump rulings all that seriously.\n\nHealy: Here\u2019s my last question \u2014 I\u2019ve been asking a lot about specific policies. A lot of Republicans like what they are seeing. But are they missing the forest for the trees? Do the individual policies matter if America\u2019s economy tanks, if there\u2019s a constitutional crisis over defying court orders, if there\u2019s geopolitical upheaval in Ukraine or Eastern Europe or Taiwan?\n\nDouthat: We are two months into the presidency, and we just lived through four years of dramatic global and domestic upheaval under a Democratic president whose manifest incapacity was deliberately concealed from the country. I have a million concerns about where this administration is going, but it\u2019s a bit soon to attack the president\u2019s supporters for being irrationally loyal.\n\nBrooks: Personally, I think Trump has set the world record for over-reading his mandate. I think his incompetence and bad character will drag him far lower this term than they did in his first. (This term, Trump is actually trying to do things.) But I wake up each morning and ask: What if I\u2019m wrong? What if Trump wins the next four years? We\u2019re entering an era of junkyard dog politics. Maybe Trump is the guy to stand up to Xi Jinping. Maybe governments need a pummeling cleanse before they can reinvent themselves. Maybe the vibe shift is permanent and the progressive march through the institutions is over. Maybe the American economy is a wonder to behold and it survives what Trump is throwing at it while our allies continue to stagnate.\n\nIf people like me focus on all the Trump failures that make us feel good, we may once again get run over by reality.\n\nFrench: The big disasters (or big triumphs) always swamp individual policies, and most people judge presidents through the prism of their own personal situation. That\u2019s exactly why Jan. 6, 2021, didn\u2019t end Trump\u2019s political career. Very few voters liked it, but they didn\u2019t see it as relevant to their lives \u2014 at least not nearly as relevant as the price of groceries or disorder in the streets.\n\nI completely agreed with the Democratic message that the rule of law was on the ballot in 2024, but I also know that voters will put up with an enormous amount of scandal and misconduct if the economy is strong and have no patience for corruption when the economy is weak. The \u201crule of law\u201d is abstract. The price of eggs is concrete.\n\nThat\u2019s why Trump\u2019s incompetence is a greater threat to his presidency than his cruelty. A malicious man can win over the masses if jobs are plentiful and gas is cheap.\n\nStephens: On most days since Trump took office, the line that has run through my head is from the movie \u201cAirplane!\u201d: \u201cLooks like I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue.\u201d It\u2019s just one damn thing after another.\n\nBut like David Brooks, I am a chastened Trump critic. I viewed his first term as a national embarrassment culminating in the epic disgrace of Jan. 6. Clearly, plenty of Americans didn\u2019t see it my way, or they noticed things to which I was mostly indifferent: growing prosperity, a new attentiveness to the proverbial forgotten man \u2014 and the vapid, arrogant, hypocritical awfulness of many a Trump scold.\n\nSo, to adapt Larry David, I\u2019m going to Curb My Nausea. Just please pass me the Dramamine, will you, Patrick?",

        "full_text": "In the wake of the crises of the decade so far \u2014 the pandemic, extreme weather and natural disasters, among others \u2014 Americans have increasingly expressed their doubts about institutions, the government especially.\n\nSince Donald Trump\u2019s return to office and the rise of Elon Musk as a major political figure, there\u2019s been intense focus on a simple set of questions: What should the government be for? Who should it help? What explains its failures? In Opinion\u2019s latest focus group, we spoke with 14 people from North Carolina who were either directly affected last year by Hurricane Helene, or who had close friends or family members who were. Because of that event, many of them were directly confronted with these questions of government help and trust in institutions. At a time when the future of many government services could change significantly, we asked them about what Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk are doing and how other leaders, like Joe Biden, handled the crisis.\n\n\u201cThe whole system of fixing things is broken. Everything that\u2019s supposed to be in place is not there,\u201d one participant said, describing his worries about not only North Carolina but also places devastated by wildfires in recent years. Some worried about FEMA\u2019s future, even if they were deeply dissatisfied with the recovery efforts last year, others wanted to rethink it entirely, and others expressed frustration with the lack of understanding in this hyperpoliticized environment and the false claims that circulated last fall.\n\nAnd at a time when people \u2014 including participants in this group \u2014 expressed real concern and worry about government cuts, layoffs and funding changes, many also expressed a skeptical and dissatisfied view of how government performs today. What does government do well? One participant answered, \u201cProvide complicated explanations for why it does what it does.\u201d\n\nI want to start off with a really big question: What is government for?\n\nGovernment has a lot of functions. It\u2019s making sure that we have a functioning society and not chaos. It\u2019s the military. It\u2019s public services and programs like Social Security and Medicaid. It\u2019s helping its citizens.\n\nMaintaining order, security, protecting our rights, having some sort of rules and structure around everything \u2014 that\u2019s my immediate thought when I think about what the government is supposed to do.\n\nYeah, the government is supposed to provide law and guidance to people so that we all have the same rights and responsibilities.\n\nLet\u2019s talk a bit about the federal government. What does the federal government do well?\n\nFund its military.\n\nCollect taxes. That\u2019s not a good thing.\n\nProvide complicated explanations for why it does what it does.\n\nNot all the people they\u2019re helping deserve the help, but they do supply help to people who are needy, like vets. I think they could do better.\n\nA great segue into my next question: Who is the federal government good at helping?\n\nRich people.\n\nI think they do take care of businesses, so as to ensure that there\u2019s work and jobs.\n\nWhat about state and local government? What are some things they do well, maybe even better than the federal government?\n\nEverything.\n\nThey are more in tune with what our citizens need, our local citizens. A lot of agencies here in North Carolina are local, and they kind of have an ear to what our local people need.\n\nNorth Carolina is definitely pushing the boundaries of working for itself versus for the people. We\u2019ve seen a lot of legislation passed recently that really doesn\u2019t have the best interest of the people, along with a lot of tactics to try to block votes. So while state governments certainly are more in tune across the board, I think North Carolina is testing the limits of what would have been acceptable in the past.\n\nWhat are some things the federal government doesn\u2019t do so well?\n\nI don\u2019t think the federal government does well with FEMA. I think that they\u2019ve let the people of Western North Carolina down.\n\nThere\u2019s been an attempt at combating rampant misinformation. I see all of these documents and websites that try to help people understand what\u2019s actually happening in government and with FEMA. But it seems to just kind of create more mistrust and misinformation. I don\u2019t really know how to combat that, but I think that we could explore other ways to build confidence in our government than tip sheets and fact sheets.\n\nI think the federal government did a terrible job on the Covid response with their overreach. They threw a lot of businesses, especially restaurants and small business owners, in a big wreck, and they silenced alternative methods of treatments for Covid.\n\nIn Washington there\u2019s a lot of discussion about making some pretty big changes to the federal government, including reducing its size. What have people heard about the changes that have been happening in the federal government?\n\nObviously, I hear about Elon Musk and DOGE and the sledgehammer that they\u2019re taking to a lot of the government agencies. There was a memo about laying off 80,000 workers in the V.A. A lot of those are veterans. So I think there\u2019s definitely waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government that needs to be corrected. But I think we need to use a scalpel, not a sledgehammer. And I think it\u2019s causing a lot of problems in the country.\n\nWe have a shadow president. Elon Musk is running the country, and Trump isn\u2019t. And he is sitting here, tearing apart the country. All these people are being laid off. It\u2019s just a mess. I voted Republican before, so it\u2019s nothing against them. But what they\u2019re doing is totally wrong.\n\nWhat, in particular, do you think is wrong about it?\n\nThat all these people are losing their jobs, veterans. There aren\u2019t any jobs. Cuts to services, U.S.A.I.D. It\u2019s everything. The markets are down. Farmers might lose their farms. It\u2019s just terrible, what\u2019s happening right now.\n\nAll the layoffs are very concerning. We\u2019re losing jobs in the technical aspects like NOAA and the National Weather Service. They recently shut down classes for the National Fire Training Academy because all those jobs and funding were cut. And those are not just somebody pushing a piece of paper somewhere. Those vital jobs that are needed to support the whole country.\n\nI think the cuts are absolutely good. We\u2019ve spent billions of dollars for other countries and crazy programs like transgender research in other countries and all kinds of idiotic, non-common-sense expenditures of taxpayer dollars. And that has to change. It\u2019s been going on for years, government waste on both sides.\n\nI want to switch gears a bit to North Carolina and Hurricane Helene. First, what\u2019s your favorite thing about living in North Carolina?\n\nI love that I am roughly an hour and a half from virtually everything except the beach. There\u2019s a big city relatively close by. I can go up to the mountains and hike. I can go over to nice flatlands. We\u2019ve got really good lakes here.\n\nI similarly love the variety that we have. The mountains are so beautiful, with amazing hikes. We have beautiful beaches and big cities, lakes and a very rich history.\n\nComing from New York \u2014 the quality of life here is, hands down, the best. The air smells different. You\u2019re not in a rush to go nowhere like we are in New York. I just love being here. And moving here was the best decision I\u2019ve ever made my whole life.\n\nObviously, a major part of life in Western North Carolina in the last year has been Hurricane Helene. What\u2019s the first thing that comes to mind when I say \u201cHurricane Helene\u201d?\n\nDevastating.\n\nHorrific.\n\nWrecked.\n\nAbsolute disaster.\n\nDevastating.\n\nYeah, devastating.\n\nDestruction.\n\nWhen I first moved to North Carolina as a kid, it was actually a week before Hurricane Hugo hit. That was a profound experience that I carry with me. Preparedness becomes a focal point with every bad storm because my dad was in construction. Still, with Hurricane Helene, it happened to be that even though they said, \u201cHere\u2019s the worst thing that could happen,\u201d it was still worse.\n\nI lived in Florida for 16 years. So I was prepared, as far as my husband and my immediate needs. But I wasn\u2019t prepared for the road coming up and the waters just doing what they did. I feel like I was as prepared as I could be, though.\n\nPorscha, you said 1. Tell me why you feel you weren\u2019t prepared.\n\nI\u2019m also from New York. I went through Hurricane Sandy. At that time, people seemed to know what was going to happen. The need to evacuate, the danger zone \u2014 all that was clear. With Helene, although we watched the news, I don\u2019t think anybody had even a clue that it was going to get that bad. One day, you\u2019re living one way, and the next day, it\u2019s just gone.\n\nWas there a specific moment when you all realized this was a bad storm?\n\nI was out of the country when it was happening. I was keeping up with the news, and no one was texting me back. It would take weeks to reach friends and family. And it was weird because they didn\u2019t know what was happening, given that there was difficulty with transportation and the phones were down. Somehow I was more informed than people who were going through it in real time.\n\nFor me, things got real when our highway and a lot of the major roads were completely blocked. That was a doozy.\n\nWhen the stream in front of my house was coming up to my front door and I was seeing bridges go underwater, I thought, \u201cOK, we\u2019re in trouble.\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t personally affected by the hurricane, but my aunt was. When I wasn\u2019t able to get in touch with her and I heard that everybody lost power for weeks on end, I knew that things were really bad. Where I\u2019m from, we got a few downed trees and lost power for a day or two.\n\nWhere do you feel you got the most accurate information about what was happening in the days when the storm was happening and in the immediate aftermath?\n\nIt was really difficult to get accurate information during the storm. But in the aftermath Blue Ridge Public Radio was the best information that I came across. They started sending daily text messages on what they knew, and they continued to do that until we had our water back and clean.\n\nIt\u2019s about the same with us. Our county, they were sending us alerts on our phone. That\u2019s how I got it before the storm.\n\nDid you encounter anything that just didn\u2019t turn out to be true or that was misleading?\n\nThat happens a lot with regular media. They try to jump on the story just to get something on the air. But they don\u2019t have either all the information or enough facts. My two-way radio connected me with a lot of North Carolina, including the VIPER Network, the radio network for the public safety officials across the entire state.\n\nThere was a lot of politicization of the event because it was right before the big election. And there was a lot of blaming. There was a lot of misinformation about who was getting helped, who was not getting help, who was flying helicopters, who wasn\u2019t. So a lot of stories that came out \u2014 a lot of things got debunked. A lot of things actually were true to some degree, but there was just a lot of things trying to polarize people instead of bringing us all together.\n\nWe were without internet for the better part of two weeks. And that meant that most people were finding information on their phones, and even then, you still couldn\u2019t get much. So a lot of people were focusing on social media, where they could get little bursts of things. There was a lot of, \u201cOh, well, I heard someone say this.\u201d Seeing it through that lens pretty consistently, there were things that were getting spread that were very obviously not true. But people were not in a position to fact-check it, and that\u2019s why it was going rampant.\n\nPorscha, I\u2019ll start with you. Why did you give the government a 1?\n\nI have family that was directly affected, and they just expressed to me how terrible it was, especially immediately after, to get help or support or even just an understanding of what\u2019s all going on or when they will get help or when or how or anything. They didn\u2019t feel safe, secure or any of the things that I said government is responsible for.\n\nI also said 1. Locally, I think things went well. In the western part of the state, absolutely not. There are still people living in tents. It\u2019s not right. I was denied my FEMA claim for damage over $15,000 at my home, and they won\u2019t do anything about it.\n\nI have family members that are still living in trailers. And just like Mark, their claims were denied. The local government, the state, they had food. They had everything. But as far as help from the government and FEMA, they didn\u2019t offer the help you\u2019d think they would.\n\nI watch both sides of the news, left and right, and try to get a common-sense truth among the polar opposite viewpoints politically. Local government and churches, they were more helpful. Definitely not FEMA. And they\u2019re the ones that supposedly have all the money.\n\nI will tell you this till the day I die: If it had not been for people coming, volunteers coming from all over the United States \u2014 we saw people from Georgia and Florida and Oregon and California and Texas \u2014 I don\u2019t know what these people would have done without the volunteers.\n\nThere have been a lot of different organizations that have really stepped up to do whatever they can. Some of them are funded by FEMA, and I\u2019ve worked with a few of those. I want to make sure that everybody knows that FEMA did more than just work with those funds that directly came to us.\n\nI\u2019m sure FEMA funds lots of different things, and I\u2019m sure some of the money went to good use. But there was one organization that we were working with, donating water and things, and they would truck the supplies up to the mountains. My grandparents live up there and were without power and water. And to be fair, I know they want to make sure things are safe and things aren\u2019t getting too crowded. But we simply weren\u2019t allowed to go and bring supplies. So that was really frustrating.\n\nWhen it comes to the recovery from something like this, what do you think were the most helpful things that the government did?\n\nIn Asheville, we got a lot of attention. The Army Corps of Engineers came in to help rebuild and clean up the main water treatment plant. Their efforts were very quick, very direct, with constant updates.\n\nThe $700 they gave people, it was very demonized, a lot of controversy to say that that was all people got. But just the fact that people got that immediate funds to help buy supplies and do things \u2014 and, I mean, I wasn\u2019t affected, but I know people who were.\n\nAre there any people, leaders or organizations that you think of more highly after seeing how they responded to the disaster?\n\nSamaritan\u2019s Purse. They were doing a lot of volunteering and a lot of cleaning up for the western part of North Carolina, along with a lot of church leaders and organizations, too.\n\nLocal church leaders and local businesses.\n\nI would agree about Samaritan\u2019s Purse. I know they had a huge volume of volunteers. I volunteered with them in Asheville.\n\nGiven my own family\u2019s experience with denied claims, I\u2019m just seeing a gray, negative cloud over everyone\u2019s handling of it. I just think there wasn\u2019t a lot of attention. I can kind of see offering a shaky hand for Biden-Harris. But it wasn\u2019t enough. And even now, I don\u2019t think that people understand that so much more help is needed. I think we\u2019re almost forgotten.\n\nThere\u2019s only so much either side can really do, you know? But I still put my hand up for Trump-Vance because the bare minimum you can do is just show up and show your support with the community and just be there and offer whatever resources you have. At least go see some of the devastation yourself and really understand and talk to the people.\n\nKirsten, you gave Biden-Harris at least a halfway raising of your hand on that one.\n\nThere were immediate funds released post-hurricane. Maybe you\u2019d expect either presidency to do that, but that just happened to be the presidency at the time of the hurricane. They did fly over. I remember that. I think it was inappropriate to be on the ground. The roads were blocked, so I think that was the right thing to do, to fly over, not to actually be going into the town and closing the few roads we had open. And that\u2019s something we saw with the Trump visit. I don\u2019t know what Trump has done, if anything. I know he wants to gut FEMA. So how is that helpful? That\u2019s my perspective.\n\nTrump got elected on Tuesday, and he was here on Friday. And I think those people needed to see that the government was there. I think they just needed reassurance, hope, whatever.\n\nWhat has the national media gotten right about how Helene affected you? What has it gotten wrong?\n\nI think there needs to be more attention to the stories of the people that are suffering. I would say it\u2019s just not loud enough.\n\nI think that the media attention was so short-lived.\n\nAll the way down in Swannanoa, I saw people still in tents. They need to come back and show those people in tents. It\u2019s almost forgotten. And I get it. You start living your life.\n\nIt\u2019s like it\u2019s old news.\n\nDid your experience with Helene change the way you think about other natural disasters, like the fires in Los Angeles?\n\nMy first thought was very selfishly like, \u201cThere goes any new support coverage for Western North Carolina. We\u2019re moving on to the next big thing.\u201d And rightfully so, on one hand, because that was devastating. But we\u2019re always moving on to the next story. So it just felt like, \u201cWell, here comes the end for our coverage.\u201d\n\nI see a few people nodding.\n\nAnd then, of course, I also felt a complete sense of loss for them because how horrifying for all those people, whether they lost their homes or just smoke damage that makes their home uninhabitable. And third, concern about FEMA \u2014 we were lucky to get a lot of money in 2024. So the 2025 bucket is probably going heavily out there. And then what does that leave for the rest of the storm season for the rest of the U.S.?\n\nYou had the fires in Hawaii, which has now been \u2014 what? \u2014 two years ago, and they haven\u2019t rebuilt yet. Now you\u2019ve got all these fires in California. How long is it going to take to rebuild that? How long is it going to take to rebuild Western North Carolina? The whole system of fixing things is broken. Everything that\u2019s supposed to be in place is not there.\n\nHas this experience changed how you think about where you live in the United States? For the people who feel there\u2019s a climate change element here, do you feel like the government helps you make decisions about where to live? Has anything about this experience changed how you think about the kind of home or neighborhood or place you would live in if you moved?\n\nThe last flooding we had in this area was, like, a hundred years ago. So I know this was just a fluke. I better knock on wood that it was a fluke. But I don\u2019t think it would make me change.\n\nI know now that I need to be more prepared, that I need to have as many resources as I possibly can for myself. I was a kid as well when Hurricane Hugo came through. And then I went through this one. So it changed my thinking \u2014 not expecting that the government would come through and help. Or if they did, I felt like they just did drive-bys.\n\nI would just stay right where I am. It\u2019s all part of nature and life.\n\nI used to worry about the disasters where I\u2019d live but not anymore. Not at all.\n\nSydney mentioned tip sheets at the beginning of our call. There were a lot of claims swirling around last year, some of which turned out to be false. Do you trust FEMA to give accurate information about things like this?\n\nI don\u2019t trust FEMA. It\u2019s not really saying anything bad about FEMA. I think that the state should handle stuff like that because FEMA, when I did see FEMA, they had no idea about the area. They didn\u2019t know the hollers and places like that. So while giving them credit for what they do, they were almost lost in some cases.\n\nUnpopular opinion: I think FEMA serves a very valuable purpose as the federal response to handle emergency management situations, like the California fires and all the things we have. I mean, Helene hit Florida. It hit Georgia. It hit South Carolina. It was not just Western North Carolina. I think it was a very difficult job because of things that Nina just talked about, all the little hollers and areas up there in the terrain. But I\u2019m scared of losing FEMA or having FEMA be cut and when the next hurricane or natural disaster happens under this administration or moving forward. FEMA is not perfect, but I think it serves a valuable purpose.\n\nI just don\u2019t trust the government hardly at all, anyway, for a lot of reasons, federal government and state. I\u2019m going to say more services should be privatized. Even FEMA could be privatized, I think.\n\nI think there is value to what FEMA does. But I want it ensured that the money\u2019s going to the communities that need help. And I do have a distrust for the government in general. I just want to make sure that the tax dollars they collect go to these communities and go to things that are really going to benefit the country.\n\nThis is a great time to bring up insurance, because that is a form of coverage, privatized coverage. We\u2019ve talked a lot about FEMA, government support. We\u2019re losing insurance in Florida and California and coastal North Carolina because of natural disasters. We pay into it. That\u2019s a private-ish way to get your money back. And a lot of these insurance claims are denied 100 percent. So I think we\u2019ve tried that, and it failed.\n\nOn the topic of insurance: There are some parts of the country where we know natural disasters are more likely, places where we know floods, fires or storms are expected. And in some of those places lately, these private insurers have started leaving markets. What do you think should be done when it comes to insuring people who live in areas that private insurers do not want to insure anymore?\n\nInsurance \u2014 that\u2019s a huge part of the problem. They paid my claim but didn\u2019t cover near everything that they should have. But insurance needs to replace these houses and everything. It is crazy. They keep raising the cost, and what do you get in return? I mean, I guess you do get some peace of mind, but there\u2019s so many different riders.\n\nWell, I had experience with the insurance company, and I called them twice a day, every day. I didn\u2019t have any problems. They paid my claims, but it\u2019s probably because I bugged them to death. They were sick of hearing from me. And to be honest with you, I have no idea how to solve that.\n\nI just think that any insurer that is going to be on the market, there should be something that our government puts down that says, \u201cIf you are going to function as a business, you are required to provide your services to anyone willing to pay for it.\u201d And there should be a limit to how much that person needs to pay, because we don\u2019t want it where there\u2019s suddenly price gouging. But everyone should be able to get insurance. And the government is one of those entities that can step in and help make that happen.\n\nIf you could tell government officials one thing about your experience as someone who lived through Helene or has watched as close family members and friends have gone through this, what would you say?\n\nI wish the government would know what the victims went through, actually. I want the government to be more helpful, to be more in tune with them.\n\nTake a chapter from the local response. I know the government on a federal level has way more resources than local. But I just wish that they would have a continued and forceful effort in the way that local government has.\n\nPeople are really suffering out there. And they need to really step up their game and send people the help that they need.\n\nI would say that these are real people that did not think that this would ever happen to them in the mountains, and that means it could happen anywhere.\n\nHave better coordination with local volunteer efforts. I think that was a big problem, that they weren\u2019t listening to the people in the street who were trying to help and were taking a little bit too much control.\n\nMake readiness a priority, be more proactive and prioritize funds so that we are fully prepared to handle these situations.\n\nI wish they would understand how cold it is in the winter in the mountains. Sleeping in tents is not a great experience. I just feel for all the people that were having to experience that.\n\nGive more of the power and resources back to the local and state governments.\n\nEverything changes. So the response that you have to one disaster one day cannot be the same response that you have to even a similar disaster the next day because everything really matters on specifics. Knowing the people and the places \u2014 that\u2019s what you have to do.\n\nWe want you to come in quick. We want you to come in fast. And we want you to immediately spread the funds and the financial assistance and don\u2019t make it hard for us to get it. And make the amounts a lot higher.\n\nDuring the aftermath of Helene, we completely forgot about the election and political agendas. And they would benefit by doing the same and thinking a little bit more about the citizens who live here.\n\nGet here sooner. And work more with the locals and volunteers to help people.\n\nPeople matter more than politics. Both Republican and Democratic administrations highly politicized the recovery efforts of the government. And I think that ultimately, like everyone said, people are still suffering. And that\u2019s been overshadowed by elections and Elon Musk\u2019s new role and everything.\n\nDo not forget us. We\u2019re still out here. We\u2019re still hurting. We\u2019re still in need. We still need to be rebuilt.\n\nAmerica in Focus seeks to hear and understand the views of cross-sections of Americans whose voices are often not heard in opinion journalism.\n\nThis discussion was moderated by a focus group veteran, Kristen Soltis Anderson, and Katherine Miller, a senior staff editor in Opinion.

        "full_text": "In his opening weeks back in office, President Trump is asserting power in a way that pushes hard on, and sometimes past, the boundaries of executive authority.\n\nOne of the most important of those boundaries involves his relationship with independent regulatory agencies. Mr. Trump is the first president since the 1930s to assert control over many of them, and this assertion of power will almost certainly be tested in the Supreme Court.\n\nMr. Trump is operating under the theory that the executive branch is unitary, in the sense that Article II of the Constitution places executive power in a single person, the president, who gets to control every high-level official who executes federal law (and plenty of lower-level ones, too).\n\nIf Mr. Trump succeeds in court, the country will see a significant shift in power from the independent agencies to the White House.\n\nFor better or for worse, that shift would be profoundly unsettling. And in some respects it could be dangerous \u2014 if, for example, a president is allowed to control monetary policy, or if he is in charge of the Federal Communications Commission, and thus able to play politics with national communications policy.\n\nThe president is not a king. In its most extreme version, the unitary executive theory is a form of invented history, a modern creation that threatens to change, and in important ways to undermine, the operations of the national government.\n\nThe theory of the unitary executive means that the president can fire, at his pleasure, the heads of the Federal Trade Commission, the National Labor Relations Board and other independent agencies. In its strongest form, the unitary executive theory means that the president can control the policy choices of those agencies. So if the F.T.C. wants to issue a rule to protect consumers, and the president thinks that\u2019s a terrible idea, then he can prevent that rule from seeing the light of day.\n\nThe unitary executive theory is supported by some distinguished scholars, who point to the Constitution\u2019s text. The first sentence of Article II states that \u201cthe executive power shall be vested in a president of the United States of America.\u201d The same article gives the president, and no one else, the power to \u201ctake care that the laws be faithfully executed.\u201d\n\nEveryone agrees that at the Constitutional Convention, the founders decided to have just one president, rather than a \u201cplural\u201d executive. Practically everyone also agrees that the very first Congress, in creating the departments of Treasury, War and Foreign Affairs, made a momentous decision, widely known as the Decision of 1789: Their heads would be at-will employees of the president. The Decision of 1789 is often thought to show acceptance of the unitary executive theory.\n\nThe current conflict over the president\u2019s authority owes its origins to the New Deal period. In a 1935 case, Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. United States, the court ruled that Congress could limit the president\u2019s power to remove a head of the F.T.C. \u2014 and thus that it could create independent agencies.\n\nUntil recently, many people agreed that under Humphrey\u2019s Executor, independent agencies are just fine under the law, and that the president does not have much authority over them. In the early 1980s, I worked in the Justice Department under President Ronald Reagan, whose White House liked the idea of a unitary executive and who wanted to know if he could exert at least some control over the independent agencies.\n\nLawyers in the Justice Department decided that Humphrey\u2019s Executor was settled law \u2014 but that it left the president some running room. If he wanted, we said, he could direct independent agencies to submit their regulations to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, the president\u2019s regulatory clearinghouse, for a degree of scrutiny and review. We did not think that the president could tell the independent agencies what rules to issue, but we did think that he could require them to subject their rules to a process of comment and analysis by the regulatory office.\n\nReagan decided not to impose that requirement, partly because of the seriousness of the legal question, and partly because of fear of a fierce congressional pushback.\n\nIn the past four decades, both Republican and Democratic presidents have followed Reagan\u2019s lead. To be sure, they have overseen internal discussions about whether to assert the unitariness of the executive and to require independent agencies to submit their rules to the O.I.R.A.\n\nI was administrator of O.I.R.A. from 2009 to 2012, and the issue came up. The White House\u2019s ultimate judgment was that presidential control would not be a good idea. Some government lawyers thought it would raise serious legal doubts. Other White House officials thought that, for one thing, independent agencies avoided an excessive concentration of power in one person. For another, such agencies reduced the risk of self-dealing (as might occur if, for example, a president rewarded his friends and punished his enemies).\n\nMore recently, the Supreme Court has shown a distinct discomfort with the whole idea of independent agencies. In Seila Law v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, decided in 2020, the court struck down a provision making the bureau independent on the ground that it was headed by a single person. The court purported to preserve Humphrey\u2019s Executor and the multimember independent agencies (like the F.C.C., the N.L.R.B. and the Fed). But at the same time, the court spoke enthusiastically about the unitary executive, and it is reasonable to doubt whether Humphrey\u2019s Executor will ultimately survive.\n\nPresident Trump does not like the idea of independent agencies. He recently fired a member of the N.L.R.B., even though board members can be discharged, under the law, only for \u201cneglect of duty or malfeasance in office, but for no other cause.\u201d\n\nHis acting solicitor general has said that the Justice Department intends to contest the for-cause protections given to the F.T.C., the N.L.R.B. and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. (Why she singled out those three agencies is not entirely clear.)\n\nThe acting solicitor general also said that in certain contexts, the department will contest the idea of independent administrative law judges \u2014 adjudicators within the executive branch who do not serve at the president\u2019s pleasure.\n\nAnd the president has directed the independent agencies to submit their rules for O.I.R.A. review, reversing the course set by Reagan and presidential administrations since.\n\nMr. Trump may ultimately win in court, but the best historical research throws the whole idea of a unitary executive into serious doubt. In the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton, who rejected a plural executive, also insisted that the president lacks unlimited removal power.\n\nAnd defenders of the unitary executive appear to have misunderstood the Decision of 1789. The most careful evidence suggests that, at the time, a majority of members of Congress did not embrace but actually rejected the view that Congress lacks power to protect subordinate officials in the executive branch from presidential control. Indeed, independent agencies are hardly a creation of the New Deal \u2014 they have been with us since the founding era.\n\nIt follows that if you are an originalist, you will probably reject Mr. Trump\u2019s broadest claims.\n\nThen there\u2019s stare decisis, or precedent. The Trump administration\u2019s claims would upset law that has been settled for 90 years. It\u2019s true that the current court has not always respected stare decisis, but it has yet to undertake the kind of radical revision of national institutions that would come from invalidating independent agencies.\n\nRequiring some independent agencies to submit their rules to O.I.R.A. would hardly be the end of the world. It could even do some good. O.I.R.A.\u2019s staffers do a thorough, careful job, and agency regulations are usually improved by the process of review. It would not be unreasonable for the Supreme Court to allow the White House and the regulatory office to comment on, and have some degree of control over, the regulations of most of the independent agencies.\n\nBut the case of the Fed puts a bright spotlight on the potential danger of giving the president unlimited authority over independent agencies. There are strong reasons for its independence. If a president could control interest rates, or oversee regulations that are connected to monetary policy, he could manage the economy so as to promote his own short-term political interests.\n\nOr take the F.C.C. A president who oversees its decisions could punish news sources that he didn\u2019t like and reward those he loved.\n\nOr consider the claim that the president gets to impound congressionally appropriated funds and choose which ones to spend. That claim would render Congress subordinate to the executive in what might be its most fundamental power: the purse. Impoundment authority, on the part of the president, would go well beyond the idea of a unitary executive. It would be a devastating blow to the separation of powers.\n\nThere are decent arguments in favor of reforms that would increase presidential control over the administrative state. But the broadest current claims about executive authority are a creation of the 21st century, not the 18th. They are a form of hubris. They strike at the heart of our founding document.",

        "full_text": "Best Moment\n\nBinyamin Appelbaum Representative Al Green\u2019s stand in defiance of a president who has governed in defiance of the law. Green\u2019s civil disobedience was the behavior of a man who believes that Trump is a threat to American democracy. Why did he stand alone?\n\nJosh Barro Trump boasted of the sharp drop in migrant encounters at the southern border and mocked President Joe Biden\u2019s insistence that better enforcement would require new laws, declaring, \u201cIt turned out that all we really needed was a new president.\u201d An effective line on his strongest issue.\n\nFrank Bruni Trump is on solid political ground \u2014 and in his comfort zone \u2014 when he talks about cracking down on illegal immigration. Among many lies, he truthfully said that fewer migrants were unlawfully crossing the border: \u201cThey heard my words, and they chose not to come.\u201d Hard to dispute that.\n\nMichelle Cottle When Trump had the director of the Secret Service make a 13-year-old boy diagnosed with brain cancer an honorary agent. It was a heartwarming plug for the president\u2019s Make America Healthy Again agenda \u2014 and a clever way to gloss over the problematic views of his health and human services chief.\n\nMichelle Goldberg Green\u2019s heckling. Democrats shouldn\u2019t have shown up at all, but if they were going to be there, noisy protest made more sense than holding up dumb little paddles. There\u2019s nothing dignified about quietly playing the foil to an autocratic thug gloating about stripping America for parts.\n\nKatherine Mangu-Ward I have long dreamed of a president dedicating a significant portion of a major speech to cuts to the federal government. Alas, the cuts cited by Trump were relatively small, unlikely to withstand scrutiny from the courts or (as in the case of his promises to stop Social Security payments to 129-year-olds) fictional.\n\nDaniel McCarthy The State of the Union and presidential addresses to Congress like Tuesday night\u2019s have become ritualized partisan performances, so when Trump said there was nothing he could do to get Democrats to stand, applaud or smile, he exposed the theatricality of their opposition. (Not that occasional bipartisanship isn\u2019t theatrical, too.)\n\nMatthew Schmitz Trump\u2019s recitation of improbable-sounding expenses he claimed to have cut was funny. More important, it dramatized the growing conviction on the right that too much public money is going to NGOs that operate without direct political accountability.\n\nFarah Stockman Trump is good at made-for-TV moments that celebrate ordinary people \u2014 a kid with cancer gets deputized as a U.S. Secret Service agent, a high schooler finds out he got into West Point, a mother is told that her dead daughter has a wildlife refuge named after her.\n\nWorst Moment\n\nAppelbaum It was 90-plus minutes of bad moments \u2014 a typical Trump medley of fabrications, provocations and insults. But the worst part was the perversity of Trump performing a democratic ritual even as he breaks this nation\u2019s laws and destroys its institutions.\n\nBarro The section on inflation, which Trump seemed eager to get past because he has nothing to offer. He blamed Biden, he proposed inflationary policies like new tax cuts, and he touted his massive tariffs, despite the \u201cdisturbance\u201d they will cause. Voters elected Trump to cut prices, and he is raising them. No wonder he\u2019d rather talk about girls\u2019 volleyball.\n\nBruni What nerve Trump has \u2014 accusing Democrats of being too causelessly meanspirited and ceaselessly ungenerous to applaud him as he delivered remarks that, like his entire political career, hinged on mocking and savaging them. Unbelievable. And yet not.\n\nCottle His repeated, literal finger-pointing at the Democratic lawmakers in attendance, as he gloated, trashed Biden and indulged in his characteristic name-calling. \u201cRadical. Left. Lunatics.\u201d\n\nGoldberg Trump\u2019s barrage of easily debunked lies about millions of dead people who could be collecting Social Security checks. The best-case scenario is that he was simply demonstrating, once again, his contempt for the truth, but it seemed like propaganda to justify Social Security cuts.\n\nMangu-Ward Trump\u2019s promise to balance the federal budget was a lie, and everyone in the room knew it. In the coming days, the people in that room will probably pass a continuing resolution that utterly fails to take seriously the real drivers of the deficit: entitlements, military spending and debt service.\n\nMcCarthy The Democrats set themselves up to have the worst moment of the night with their jeering and heckling, especially since it reached full fury as Trump was recounting his popular-vote victory. That made it sound as though the opposition was angry at the American public.\n\nSchmitz The opening section of an overlong speech was wasted on hollow boasting.\n\nStockman When he walked into the Capitol, a place he incited his supporters to storm, cheered by many of the very people who were forced to flee. A very surreal moment.\n\nWhat Else Mattered\n\nAppelbaum The frat boy glee on the Republican side of the aisle.\n\nBarro Trump made good use of Skutniks, especially DJ Daniels, a 13-year-old with cancer whom Trump named as an honorary Secret Service agent. Even though his speech felt interminable \u2014 far longer than any State of the Union or joint address to Congress since at least 1964 \u2014 these bright moments are what casual observers are likely to see as highlights.\n\nBruni Everything in Trump\u2019s world is extreme, absolute, unnuanced, superlative. Worst ever. Best ever. \u201cLike nothing that has ever been seen before.\u201d Over and over. It\u2019s juvenile. It\u2019s narcissistic. It\u2019s exhausting \u2014 like his speech, which made Sunday night\u2019s Oscars seem succinct.\n\nCottle Much of the speech was geared toward painting Democrats as knee-jerk champions of a deeply flawed federal government in which much of the American public has lost faith. Clever.\n\nGoldberg Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has been floating the idea that Trump could reverse his destructive tariffs on Canada and Mexico as soon as Wednesday, but that\u2019s not the message Trump sent on Tuesday night. \u201cTariffs are not just about protecting American jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are about protecting the soul of our country.\u201d\n\nMangu-Ward Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, brought the Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht as his guest. Ulbricht recently received a pardon from Trump, the culmination of years of advocacy by Ulbricht\u2019s mom, Lyn, to free her unjustly imprisoned son.\n\nMcCarthy Trump has become a master of drawing battle lines that put Democrats at a disadvantage, which he did here by weaving guests\u2019 stories of suffering and injustice into his calls for border controls, stronger policing and children\u2019s safety. As controversial as his policies may sound at first, he turns them into common sense.\n\nSchmitz Various European countries have tried Trump\u2019s \u201cgold card\u201d idea to sell citizenship, and several are now backing away from it. It\u2019s a scheme the United States will also come to regret.\n\nStockman Trump didn\u2019t gloat as much as I would have expected when he read a message from President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine offering to sign a mineral deal that was derailed last week after a testy press availability with Trump and his entourage.",

        "full_text": "It\u2019s difficult to convey the full magnitude of the legal chaos emanating from the Trump administration. It goes well beyond the violation of individual laws \u2014 much of the past month has featured what feels like an assault on the very idea of law as a binding constraint.\n\nThis has been especially acute when it comes to personnel, both hiring and firing. For the dozens of high-level officials President Trump has fired in violation of clear legal restrictions, he is likely to be at least somewhat vindicated by a Supreme Court that has been increasingly skeptical of laws limiting the president\u2019s ability to fire at will.\n\nBut Mr. Trump is on decidedly shakier ground when it comes to how he has empowered Elon Musk, who is perhaps the most important figure in the new administration based on the efforts taken to reshape the federal government through his Department of Government Efficiency initiative. That\u2019s most likely why the White House has tied itself in knots trying to explain to courts and to the public the nature of Mr. Musk\u2019s role. Presumably, that\u2019s because it seems clear that the Constitution does not allow it.\n\nThat\u2019s true at the level of broad constitutional principles \u2014 particularly the principle that sovereignty flows from the people and that only officials selected through constitutional methods get to wield power in our name. This insight seems to undergird the growing mobilization against Elon Musk. Protesters at Tesla showrooms who are displaying signs that say \u201cno one voted for Elon Musk\u201d are making, intentionally or not, a constitutionally inflected claim.\n\nMr. Musk\u2019s power also is squarely at odds with concrete constitutional provisions. While the Constitution is largely silent on removal \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s arguments that the Constitution gives him limitless power to fire are atextual \u2014 the document is quite specific when it comes to appointment.\n\nSupreme Court cases make clear that individuals who serve in \u201ccontinuing\u201d positions and who exercise \u201csignificant authority\u201d on behalf of the United States must be appointed consistent with the Constitution\u2019s Appointments Clause. As far as I can tell, Mr. Musk hasn\u2019t been.\n\nThe Appointments Clause \u2014 part of Article II, the source of Mr. Trump\u2019s virtually boundless conception of presidential power \u2014 sets forth two methods of appointment of what are called \u201cofficers of the United States.\u201d \u201cPrincipal\u201d officers must be nominated by the president and are subject to the advice and consent of the Senate. For \u201cinferior officers,\u201d the Constitution allows Congress to give the appointment power to the president alone \u2014 that is, without Senate confirmation \u2014 or to the head of a department, or to the courts of law. Inferior officers must be subject to the supervision of someone other than the president; if you report directly to the president, you\u2019re a principal officer.\n\nThis means that the individuals who wield the most authority \u2014 principal officers \u2014 are subject to both the public scrutiny and the check that is supposed to be imposed by Senate confirmation.\n\nMr. Musk appears to be wielding significant power, as evidenced by his presence at the administration\u2019s first cabinet meeting last week. He was the first to speak after the president\u2019s introduction. He boasted about pushing federal employees to respond to an email about their work, inveighed about the federal deficit and casually disclosed that his team had inadvertently canceled funding for Ebola prevention \u2014 an error he claims was quickly rectified, but may not have been. The email he mentioned appears to have been dashed off without advance warning even to the cabinet.\n\nThe Supreme Court has found that a range of government workers exercise enough authority that they are officers and must be appointed through one of the methods outlined in the Constitution \u2014 including many who exercise far less authority than Mr. Musk appears to. In 2018, for example, the court held that administrative law judges at the Securities and Exchange Commission were officers of the United States. In a more recent decision, the court explained that \u201cthousands of officers wield executive power\u201d on the president\u2019s behalf, power that \u201cacquires its legitimacy and accountability to the public through \u2018a clear and effective chain of command\u2019 down from the president.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the main basis on which Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the classified-documents case against Mr. Trump was that the special counsel Jack Smith was an officer of the United States who had not been constitutionally appointed. The specifics of her conclusion were highly dubious \u2014 but she was right that \u201cthe Appointments Clause is a critical constitutional restriction stemming from the separation of powers.\u201d\n\nTwo legal cases are making the argument that Mr. Musk\u2019s power cannot be squared with the Appointments Clause. They contend that if Mr. Musk is as powerful as he seems to be, he must be appointed consistent with the Constitution \u2014 and he\u2019s most likely a principal officer, which means Senate confirmation.\n\nOne case, in Maryland, was brought by a group of current and former federal employees and contractors; another, in Washington, D.C., was brought by a number of states. In a hearing last week, the judge in the Maryland case, Theodore Chuang, said that he was \u201chighly suspicious\u201d of the administration\u2019s explanation for Mr. Musk\u2019s role and characterized its insistence that he has no formal role in the Department of Government Efficiency as apparently \u201cfactually inaccurate.\u201d\n\nThe district judge in the Washington case has made clear that allegations suggest that Mr. Musk has \u201crapidly taken steps to fundamentally reshape the executive branch,\u201d with no apparent \u201csource of legal authority.\u201d His actions appear to describe \u201cprecisely the \u2018executive abuses\u2019 that the Appointments Clause seeks to prevent.\u201d\n\nBased on well-settled principles, these claims should succeed in the cases. The decisions are unlikely to invalidate what has been done to the federal government by those involved in Mr. Musk\u2019s initiative \u2014 but they should say that Mr. Musk cannot continue to exercise this authority without a constitutionally permissible appointment.\n\nThere is no small irony in Mr. Musk\u2019s exercising this amount of extraconstitutional authority. Mr. Trump\u2019s allies have consistently alluded to the principle of democratic legitimacy in their broadsides against the administrative state. When Mr. Musk laid out the principles of DOGE in an opinion essay, written with Vivek Ramaswamy, they said that \u201cmost government enforcement decisions and discretionary expenditures aren\u2019t made by the democratically elected president or even his political appointees\u201d but by people who were, they stressed, \u201cunelected\u201d and \u201cunappointed.\u201d This, they said, is \u201cantidemocratic and antithetical to the founders\u2019 vision.\u201d\n\nThe system the founders created includes clear requirements for ensuring legitimacy and accountability in positions of significant government power. Americans should insist that if President Trump wants Mr. Musk in government, there\u2019s a way to do that: appoint him as the Constitution requires.",

He said Judge Boasberg was allowing terrorists to mount a class-action lawsuit without heeding national security.\n\n\u201cThe district court\u2019s hasty public inquiry into these sensitive national security matters \u2014 with no contemplated protections against disclosure of operational details \u2014 underscores the urgency of immediate relief from this court, including an immediate administrative stay,\u201d Mr. Ensign said in a filing asking Judge Boasberg be kicked off the case.\n\nThe fight goes to the heart of Mr. Trump\u2019s biggest claims of his second term, including that his national security powers are virtually unfettered, that the country has seen an \u201cinvasion\u201d of illegal immigrants, and the result has been a border emergency and an influx of terrorists in the form of cartel and transnational gang activity.\n\nSEE ALSO: Justice Dept. cites Trump\u2019s commander-in-chief powers to defend deportations to El Salvador\n\nIn a hearing Monday, Judge Boasberg grilled the government\u2019s attorneys, demanding to know the timing of the administration\u2019s actions and whether they ignored his oral instructions.\n\nTwo planes appear to have been in the air during his hearing Saturday. Another seems to have departed the U.S. airport after the hearing. It\u2019s unclear whether it left before the judge issued a written order.\n\nJudge Boasberg wanted to know whether any people he was trying to block from deportation were on that third flight and said he wanted the information fast.\n\nHe asked how many potential targets there are for deportation under the Alien Enemies Act and asked the administration to say whether it would reveal particulars about the flights and their timing.\n\n\u201cIf the government takes the position that it will not provide that information to the court under any circumstances, it must support such position, including with classified authorities if necessary,\u201d he wrote in an order Monday night.\n\nHe gave the administration a deadline of noon Tuesday and told them they could file part of their answers under seal if necessary.\n\nHe is the latest judge to sharply question the veracity of Trump administration claims amid a flurry of lawsuits challenging the president\u2019s executive actions.\n\nSalvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who is being paid about $20,000 per person per year to hold Tren de Aragua members in his Terrorism Confinement Center, mocked Judge Boasberg\u2019s order.\n\n\u201cOopsie\u2026 Too late,\u201d he posted to social media with a laughing emoji. The post was promoted by Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nHe released a video of his new guests, showing men being manhandled off the plane, having their hair and beards shorn off, dressed in white T-shirts, white undershorts and white sandals, shackled and taken to cells.\n\nMr. Bukele said the deal was good for all sides.\n\n\u201cThe United States will pay a very low fee for them, but a high one for us,\u201d he said. He also said the MS-13 deportees on the flights would help his own country, where the gang has been based, to root out the gang\u2019s money, weapons, drugs and collaborators.\n\nJudge Boasberg, an Obama appointee to the district court in Washington, quickly became a target of conservative outrage.\n\nA House Republican said over the weekend that he would introduce articles of impeachment to try to remove the judge.\n\nThe White House has embraced the fight over deportations, believing it has strong legal and political ground.\n\n\u201cThere were violent criminals and rapists in our country. Democrats fought to keep them here. President Trump deported them,\u201d said Vice President J.D. Vance.\n\nTom Homan, Mr. Trump\u2019s border czar and head of his deportation agency in the first Trump administration, said the U.S. ousted 238 members of the Tren de Aragua gang, based in Venezuela, and sent 21 MS-13 gang members to El Salvador.\n\n\u201cWith each criminal illegal alien being deported, neighborhoods are becoming safer,\u201d he said.\n\nCongressional Democrats were far less excited about the way the situation is playing out. They accused Mr. Trump of violating the deportees\u2019 \u201cdue process\u201d rights.\n\n\u201cThis attempt to use an archaic wartime law \u2014 not used since World War II \u2014 for immigration enforcement is yet another unlawful and brazen power grab,\u201d said a joint statement by Sens. Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, Alex Padilla of California, Cory A. Booker of New Jersey and Peter Welch of Vermont.\n\nThey said the U.S. is \u201cnot at war, and immigrants are not invading our country,\u201d so there is no justification for using the 1798 law.\n\nThey said the danger is Mr. Trump will deport U.S. citizens \u201cor people who haven\u2019t committed a crime.\u201d\n\nJudge Boasberg isn\u2019t the first to order a deportation flight to turn around.\n\nIn 2018, in the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s attempt to stiffen asylum standards, Judge Emmet G. Sullivan ordered a plane headed for El Salvador to be returned and threatened contempt of court on U.S. officials who defied him.\n\nThe flight wasn\u2019t turned around, but a mother and child who were the plaintiffs in a case before Judge Sullivan were kept on the plane as it flew back to the U.S.\n\nThe Tren de Aragua deportees aren\u2019t the only case testing Mr. Trump\u2019s powers.\n\nA Lebanese doctor was blocked by Customs and Border Protection officers as she tried to enter the U.S. on a guest worker visa last week.\n\nDr. Rasha Alawieh has been working in the U.S. for years on an H-1B visitor\u2019s visa and is a professor at Brown University, but CBP officials say when she flew into Boston\u2019s Logan International Airport on Thursday, she had images of Hezbollah figures on her phone.\n\nShe was put on a plane out of the U.S. on Friday, about the same time a judge ordered her to be kept in the country pending a decision.\n\nCBP said the order didn\u2019t reach its staff at the airport until the plane had departed.\n\nIn court documents Monday, CBP justified the decision to block the doctor.\n\n\u201cWith the discovery of these photographs and videos CBP questioned Dr. Alawieh and determined that her true intentions in the United States could not be determined,\u201d the documents allege, according to The Providence Journal.\n\nThe judge had scheduled an emergency hearing for Monday morning but canceled it after CBP\u2019s new information and amid a change in attorneys for the doctor\u2019s cousin, who filed a lawsuit to try to block her deportation.",

        "full_text": "A coalition of 21 Democratic attorneys general sued Thursday to block the Trump administration from gutting the Department of Education, arguing that Congress created the Cabinet-level agency and only Congress may abolish it.\n\nThe lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts came two days after Education Secretary Linda McMahon announced that the department\u2019s staff would be cut by about 2,183 employees for a 50% reduction in force.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James called the staffing cuts \u201creckless and illegal.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday I am taking action to stop the madness and protect our schools and the students who depend on them,\u201d she said in a Thursday press release.\n\nPresident Trump campaigned on a promise to eliminate the department, calling it \u201ca big con job.\u201d The attorneys general accused him of exceeding his authority.\n\n\u201cThe Department is an executive agency authorized by Congress, with numerous different laws creating its various programs and funding streams,\u201d said the release. \u201cThe coalition\u2019s lawsuit asserts that the executive branch does not have the legal authority to unilaterally incapacitate or dismantle it without an act of Congress.\u201d\n\nThe department began operations in 1980 after President Carter signed into law the Department of Education Organization Act. Critics blasted the move as a sop by the president to the National Education Association in exchange for its campaign endorsement.\n\nRepublicans have sought to eliminate the department since President Reagan took office in 1981, but Mr. Trump\u2019s 50% reduction in force represents the most dramatic step in that direction.\n\nRepublicans argue that the $268 billion department is inefficient, bloated and unnecessary, given that states and local governments are in charge of building and funding schools. Democrats counter that the department provides critical resources.\n\n\u201cThis administration may claim to be stopping waste and fraud, but it is clear that their only mission is to take away the necessary services, resources, and funding that students and their families need,\u201d Ms. James said in a Thursday statement. \u201cFiring half of the Department of Education\u2019s workforce will hurt students throughout New York and the nation, especially low-income students and those with disabilities who rely on federal funding.\u201d\n\nPrograms run by the department serve \u201cnearly 18,200 school districts and over 50 million K-12 students attending roughly 98,000 public schools and 32,000 private schools,\u201d said the Democrats in a statement.\n\nSchool districts in New York received $6.17 billion, or $2,438 per student, from the department in Fiscal Year 2024. Republicans argue that the funding comes with strings, such as requiring schools to adopt diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\n\nThe department said Tuesday that it will continue to fulfill its statutory obligations despite the staffing cuts, including student loans, Pell Grants, funding for special-needs students, grant-making and formula funding, but the Democrats were leery.\n\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s layoff is so massive that ED will be incapacitated and unable to perform essential functions,\u201d said the Democratic attorneys general in a press release.\n\nThe Democratic attorneys general joining Ms. James represent the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe department\u2019s reduction in force included 600 employees who voluntarily retired or resigned. About 1,400 will be placed on administrative leave starting Friday.\n\nMs. McMahon said the workforce reductions reflect the department\u2019s \u201ccommitment to efficiency, accountability, and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents, and teachers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI appreciate the work of the dedicated public servants and their contributions to the Department,\u201d she said in her Tuesday statement. \u201cThis is a significant step toward restoring the greatness of the United States education system.\u201d\n\nThe Education Department is the third-youngest of the Cabinet-level departments, older only than Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs.\n\n\u2022 Stephen Dinan contributed to this story.",

        "full_text": "President Trump announced Monday that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. plans to spend $100 billion on new manufacturing plants in Arizona.\n\nTSMC is the world\u2019s biggest semiconductor manufacturer. Companies such as Apple and Intel use its chips in computers, smartphones, cars and medical equipment.\n\n\u201cThis will create hundreds of billions of dollars in economic activity and boost America\u2019s dominance in artificial intelligence and beyond,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cSemiconductors are the backbone of the 21st-century economy, and really, without the semiconductors, there is no economy.\u201d\n\nThe money will go toward five facilities in Arizona, which Mr. Trump said will create 20,000 to 25,000 jobs.\n\n\u201cThe most powerful AI chips in the world will be made right here in America,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president called the move \u201ca matter of economic security, it\u2019s also a matter of national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here in American factories with American skill and American labor,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nC.C. Wei, the CEO of TSMC, said he was \u201chappy\u201d to announce the $100 billion investment and thanked Mr. Trump for his support.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to create thousands of high-paying jobs,\u201d Mr. Wei said.\n\nTSMC chips manufactured in the U.S. will not be subject to tariffs.\n\nMr. Trump said these and other new factories will increase the U.S. manufacturing share to close to 40% of the chips in the global market.\n\nTSMC benefited from President Biden\u2019s CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which promised $6.6 billion in funding. The company spent more than $65 billion to build three facilities in Arizona, and the first started producing 4-nanometer chips late last year.\n\nMr. Trump has threatened up to 100% tariffs on semiconductor chip imports if production isn\u2019t moved to the U.S.\n\nHe has bashed the CHIPS Act for giving money to a company that already had plenty. He has also raised concerns about Taiwan\u2019s dominance in the industry.\n\n\u201cThey left us and went to Taiwan,\u201d Mr. Trump told congressional Republicans in January. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t want to give them billions of dollars like this ridiculous program that Biden has given everybody billions of dollars. They already have billions of dollars. They\u2019ve got nothing but money. \u2026 They didn\u2019t need money. They needed an incentive. And the incentive is going to be they\u2019re not going to want to pay a 25, 50 or even a 100% tax.\u201d\n\nCritics of the Taiwan-based company say it has a monopoly on the worldwide microchip market. More than 90% of the most advanced chips come out of the island, which is the target of constant invasion threats by China.\n\nAnalysts see risks to TSMC operating only out of Taiwan, as it has largely done to date.\n\nAttacks on the island leading to destroyed facilities could leave America shorthanded, putting at risk some of the country\u2019s most important technology and affecting the U.S. military. The company has some facilities in mainland China, which could be susceptible to hacking and sabotage.\n\nLawmakers and other officials have suggested that TSMC\u2019s fabrication plants should be destroyed to prevent them from falling into China\u2019s hands if the communist power follows through with its threat to take over Taiwan, which it views as a renegade province.\n\nThe notion was criticized because the absence of production on Taiwan, regardless of political control, would badly damage economies worldwide.\n\nThe TSMC announcement is just one of several investment announcements Mr. Trump has made since he took office.\n\nThe heads of OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank plan to spend up to $500 billion in artificial intelligence infrastructure. DAMAC Properties said it will spend $20 billion to build data centers.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook has announced plans to invest $500 billion in the U.S. and move manufacturing plants from Mexico to the U.S.\n\nHonda announced Monday that it will produce its next-generation Civic hybrid in the U.S. instead of Mexico to avoid any tariffs.",

        "full_text": "The Education Department said Tuesday it will slim down to fewer than 2,200 employees, a nearly 50% reduction from what it looked like when President Trump took office.\n\nThe department said nearly 600 employees took buyouts and nearly 1,400 others will be notified they are on administrative leave.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s reduction in force reflects the Department of Education\u2019s commitment to efficiency, accountability, and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents, and teachers,\u201d said Secretary of Education Linda McMahon.\n\nShe said all of the department\u2019s divisions will see reductions, with some getting what she called a \u201csignificant reorganization.\u201d\n\nIn a later interview on , Ms. McMahon said the department is shuttering its office doors on Wednesday as a security precaution. She said employees were told to take their laptops and phones with them.\n\n\u201cThose that are coming back will know that they\u2019ll be coming back on Thursday,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Education Department is a relative newcomer to the Cabinet, having been created in 1980. It\u2019s the third-youngest of the departments, older only than Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs.\n\nSince that creation, conservatives have targeted the department and question the federal government\u2019s role in schooling. They argue that it has become a way to foist ideological fads onto local schools, who have to accept federal mandates along with Uncle Sam\u2019s cash.\n\nDemocrats said the cuts were Mr. Trump\u2019s first attempt at achieving such an abolition.\n\n\u201cUltimately, what they want to do is clear: fire the people who help our kids and gut funding for our students, teachers, and schools. This is about breaking government for working families \u2014 and enriching billionaires like themselves in the process,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray, the senior Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n\nMs. McMahon, though, said she\u2019s not cutting any education. She characterized the moves as slashing bureaucracy and returning more decisions to local control and to parents themselves.\n\nShe said the department will continue to make payments on programs such as Pell Grants and student loans and on spending under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Those tasks, she said, are required by law.\n\nMs. McMahon was confirmed by the Senate last week and showed signs in her Fox interview of still getting up to speed. At one point she stumbled over what IDEA stood for.\n\n\u201cYou know what? I\u2019m not sure I can tell you exactly what it stands for, except that it\u2019s the programs for disabled and needs,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is my fifth day on the job. I\u2019m really trying to learn it.\u201d\n\nThe department had 4,133 employees on Inauguration Day and will soon be down to roughly 2,183.\n\nThe department said 259 employees took the Deferred Resignation Program, dubbed the Trump administration buyout. Some 313 others took a $25,000 Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment.\n\nThe difference will be made up in the administrative leave announcements to come later this month.\n\nThose being let go will be paid in full up through June 9 and will get \u201csubstantial\u201d retirement or severance pay based upon their time on the job.\n\nRep. Rosa DeLauro, Connecticut Democrat, called the staff cuts illegal.\n\n\u201cNo president or member of the executive branch has the authority to end public education, violate the law, and unilaterally steal dollars promised to students,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Tommy Schultz, CEO of the American Federation for Children, said Ms. McMahon\u2019s move is a blow to teachers unions \u201cwho care only about preserving their own power.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis news is another signal that the bureaucratic state is coming to an end in America, ushering in a golden age in American education that is centered on sending education back to the states and parents,\u201d he said.",

Comey, was revealed by an agency whistleblower in a protected disclosure to the House Judiciary Committee last year and first reported exclusively by The in October.\n\nIn the intelligence community, a honeypot commonly refers to an undercover operative, usually a woman, who feigns sexual or romantic interest to obtain information from a target.\n\nThe whistleblower said two female FBI undercover employees infiltrated Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign at high levels and were directed to act as \u201choneypots\u201d while traveling with Mr. Trump and his campaign staff.\n\nThe Times has learned that the bureau, now led by Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino, is looking for those once-undercover employees under Mr. Comey\u2019s direction.\n\nThe FBI declined to comment.\n\nAccording to the whistleblower disclosure, which The Times reviewed, the investigation differed from Crossfire Hurricane, a later FBI counterintelligence operation that looked into never-proved allegations that the campaign was colluding with Russia.\n\nThe whistleblower said the early off-the-books criminal investigation targeted Mr. Trump and his staff.\n\nMr. Trump launched his presidential campaign on June 16, 2015, about a year before the FBI opened Crossfire Hurricane.\n\nThe whistleblower agent \u201cpersonally knew\u201d that Mr. Comey ordered an FBI investigation into Mr. Trump and that Mr. Comey \u201cpersonally directed it,\u201d according to the disclosure.\n\nThe investigation did not appear to target a specific crime but was more of what agents would describe as a fishing expedition to find anything incriminating against Mr. Trump.\n\nThe whistleblower said the undercover operation was obscured from Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz, who investigated misconduct in the bureau\u2019s probe of the Trump campaign.\n\n\u201cThe case had no predicated foundation, so Comey personally directed the investigation without creating an official case file in Sentinel or any other FBI system,\u201d according to the whistleblower\u2019s disclosure. \u201cThe FBI has multiple methods of protecting highly sensitive investigations, so Comey did not have a legitimate reason not to officially create an official investigation file or have a file number.\u201d\n\nThe disclosure says the secret investigation may have indicated institutional bias at the FBI against Mr. Trump, though \u201cit does not appear that any information about this investigation was turned over to Trump\u2019s criminal defense counsels.\u201d\n\nThe investigation was eventually closed because a major newspaper obtained a photograph of one of the undercovers and was about to publish it, but the FBI press office told the outlet that the photograph was an FBI informant who would be killed if the photograph was publicly released.\n\nIn fact, it was a photograph of the FBI undercover employee.\n\nThe FBI whistleblower employee noted in the disclosure that one of the undercovers agreed to be transferred to the CIA so she would not be available as a potential witness.\n\nThe other undercover employee was rewarded for her activities through a promotion in the bureau and is now a high-level FBI executive in a major field office.\n\nThe whistleblower employee observed one or more employees in the FBI being directed to never discuss the operation with anyone ever again, including other people involved in the 2016 Trump campaign infiltration operation.",

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who declared after the disappointing 2024 election that Democrats were no longer the party of the working class.\n\nSanders accused Democrats in November\u00a0of abandoning the working class, and he accused party leaders of defending the \u201cstatus quo.\u201d\u00a0He also led opposition to the House-passed funding bill, saying it would \u201cliterally take food out of the mouths\u00a0of hungry children, take health care away from seniors, and give a huge tax break to the wealthiest people on the planet.\u201d\n\nMany Democrats were outraged by Schumer\u2019s vote to advance the Republican spending bill; Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), a leading progressive, called it a betrayal.\n\nSaying it was a \u201chuge slap in the face,\u201d she noted that vulnerable Democrats in districts Trump won in 2024 risked their seats to vote against the bill, only to watch 10 Democratic senators \u201cacquiesce\u201d to the Republican legislation.\n\nThe backlash was so intense that Schumer postponed a publicity tour scheduled for this week to promote his new book, \u201cAntisemitism in America: A Warning,\u201d due to what his publicity team called \u201csecurity concerns.\u201d\n\nEven aside from last week\u2019s battle, key Democrats are growing disenchanted with the party\u2019s ability to connect with voters \u2014 especially white voters without college degrees.\n\nFormer Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who lost his seat in last year\u2019s election despite Senate Democrats and their allies pouring tens of millions of dollars into his race, warned earlier this month that the Democratic Party\u2019s reputation had become \u201ctoxic.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must reckon with how far our party has strayed from our New Deal roots. How we see ourselves \u2014 the party of the people, the party of the working class and the middle class \u2014 no longer matches up with what most voters think,\u201d he wrote on the social platform X.\n\nSchumer responded to these criticisms in a New York Times interview.\n\nHe acknowledged the Democratic Party had \u201clost\u201d its reputation with many voters as the party of the working class but insisted it wasn\u2019t because its values had changed but because its messaging had failed to connect with too many Americans.\n\n\u201cWe always cared about the working people. But in the last few years, while we did a lot for working people, here\u2019s what we didn\u2019t do: We didn\u2019t tell people about it. We thought, just by legislating, people would know about it. They don\u2019t!\u201d he said.\n\nBack in Washington, some Democratic lawmakers are privately grumbling over what many in their base view as the Democratic leadership\u2019s feeble response to Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nSchumer\u2019s press conferences vowing to resist Trump\u2019s agenda earlier this year have been mocked by Democratic commentators on television and on social media.\n\nComedian Jon Stewart last month pleaded with Democrats to \u201cstop f\u2011\u2011\u2011ing trotting Schumer out there every time Trump traverses into the unreal,\u201d taking a shot at a Schumer news conference in which he used an avocado and Corona beer as props to illustrate his points about the economic impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nInside the Capitol, some Democrats are calling for Schumer to come up with a better game plan to counter partisan must-pass bills coming from the House.\n\nCritics within the party said that Schumer\u2019s strategy last week appeared to be simply hoping that the partisan funding bill wouldn\u2019t make it out of the House.\n\nBut some Democratic senators, notably Sen. John Fetterman (Pa.), thought it was likely that Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) would muster enough votes to pass the bill.\n\nSen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), the ranking member of the Budget Committee, took the lead in urging colleagues to vote against the House funding bill after it passed the lower chamber Tuesday.\n\nThey did so even after Schumer made clear to his Democratic colleagues in private conversations that he wanted to avoid a government shutdown at all costs.\n\nSchumer later argued on the floor that even though he thought the House-passed bill was \u201cterrible,\u201d it was still a better option than allowing the government to shut down.\n\n\u201cAllowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option,\u201d he warned.\n\nSome Democratic senators who split with Schumer over his decision to help Republicans pass a partisan funding bill acknowledge he may have made the right call. They concede that it could have played into Trump\u2019s and Musk\u2019s plan to slash federal programs had the government shut down Saturday.\n\nAnd some Democratic senators are relieved Schumer and his close allies, including Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (Ill.) and Sen. Brian Schatz (Hawaii), took the tough votes to advance the spending bill so they didn\u2019t have to.\n\nBut there\u2019s growing frustration among Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill that they\u2019re out of step with much of America.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have said for months that the results of the 2024 election, in which they lost control of the White House and Senate, shows their party is failing to connect with voters in a fundamental way.\n\nAfter last week\u2019s bruising battle, some Democratic senators say it\u2019s time to start thinking about who will succeed Schumer.\n\nBut even while Democratic senators start to mull a new generation of leadership, they emphasize Schumer is likely to stay in his job through 2028, when he will be up for reelection at the age of 78.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), the chair of the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, and Schatz, who is deputy Democratic conference secretary, are two lawmakers poised to move up the leadership ladder \u2014 as is Murphy, who spearheaded the negotiation of a bipartisan border security package last year.\n\nBut Klobuchar, 64, who ran for president in 2020 and gained more traction than many Democratic strategists expected, and Murphy, 51, may be harboring presidential ambitions.\n\nAnd Schatz, 52, has a lower public profile than many of his Democratic colleagues, even though he is a prolific presence on social media.\n\nSome Democratic lawmakers think it\u2019s time for a \u201cnew generation\u201d of leadership, which means that Murray, who is 74, and Durbin, who is 80 and considered likely to retire in 2026, are not first-choice candidates to replace Schumer.\n\nSen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), 66, who brokered a deal Friday with Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) to fix a provision in the House bill that would cut close to $1 billion from the District of Columbia\u2019s budget, has been floated as a dark horse future candidate for leader. Van Hollen has kept a low profile in the Senate, but he held leadership positions in the House.\n\nSen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), 64, who led House prosecutors during Trump\u2019s first impeachment trial in 2021 and represents the nation\u2019s biggest state, is also seen as a rising star who could vault to the top of the leadership ranks once he has time to establish himself in the Senate.\n\nHe was just elected to the upper chamber last year, but colleagues are already touting him as someone with huge leadership potential.\n\n Nexstar Media Inc.

        "full_text": "Republican lawmakers are sounding the alarm over the Trump administration\u2019s pointed refusal to blame Russia for starting the war in Ukraine, and they are highly skeptical about negotiating any lasting peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom some describe as a war criminal.\n\nThe Republican criticism of President Trump\u2019s strategy for ending the war in Ukraine comes after the United States voted with Russia and its allies, such as North Korea and Belarus, against a United Nations resolution condemning Russian aggression toward Ukraine and calling for the withdrawal of its troops from the country.\n\nWhile GOP senators were willing to grant Trump broad deference on his controversial Cabinet nominees, they are doubling down in blaming Russia for starting the war and warning the president to approach Putin warily in any negotiation.\n\nSenate Appropriations Committee Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) blasted the American opposition to the U.N. resolution condemning Russian aggression.\n\n\u201cYesterday\u2019s vote by the U.S. against the U.N. resolution was shameful,\u201d she said Tuesday.\n\nThe measure, which received the backing of NATO allies, passed the U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly despite the U.S. opposition.\n\nThe United States instead backed a resolution that called for immediate peace in Ukraine but made no mention of Russia\u2019s invasion for starting the conflict.\n\nCollins said she agreed with Sen. Mitch McConnell\u2019s (R-Ky.) statement marking the third anniversary of the war, in which the former Senate GOP leader said refusing to blame Russia \u201cas the undeniable and unprovoked aggressor\u201d in the conflict \u201creflects a gross misunderstanding of the nature of negotiations and leverage.\u201d\n\nSen. John Curtis (R-Utah) said he was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d that the U.S. voted Monday with Russia and North Korea and against traditional allies such as Britain and France, which supported the resolution condemning Russia and calling for a restoration of Ukraine\u2019s borders.\n\n\u201cI was deeply troubled by the vote at the UN today, which puts us on the same side as Russia and North Korea. These are not our friends. This posture is a dramatic shift from American ideals of freedom and democracy,\u201d Curtis said in a post on social media.\n\nHe warned that any end to the war \u201cmust be achieved on terms that ensure Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and security\u201d and \u201cdeter\u201d Putin from future territorial aggression.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) on Tuesday marked the third anniversary of Russia\u2019s \u201cunprovoked war on Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all want this senseless war to end, but ending it on Russia\u2019s terms would be a devastating mistake that plays right into Putin\u2019s bloody hands,\u201d Murkowski posted on social media.\n\nShe later noted Trump has \u201cthe authority\u201d to pursue a peace deal but warned that any such deal would be \u201cunacceptable\u201d if Putin sets the terms.\n\n\u201cThe president clearly has the ability, has the authority to be negotiating. But I think many of us have suggested that negotiating peace on Putin\u2019s terms is not acceptable,\u201d she told reporters.\n\nSome of the strongest pushback in the conference came from McConnell, who now leads the Senate\u2019s Appropriations defense subcommittee.\n\n\u201cAmerica is right to seek an end to this war, but an end that fails to constrain Russian ambition, ensure Ukrainian sovereignty or strengthen American credibility with both allies and adversaries is no end at all. Instead, such a hollow peace would invite further aggression,\u201d he said in a statement Monday.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said he \u201cdisagreed\u201d with the U.S. vote against the resolution condemning Russian aggression.\n\n\u201cPutin is a murderer who\u2019s ordered the systematic capture, kidnapping, rape and torture of countless numbers of Ukrainians,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would have been my vote recommendation.\u201d\n\nHe argued Putin can\u2019t be trusted to uphold any peace deal, a warning echoed by other GOP lawmakers.\n\n\u201cPutin\u2019s a liar and looking for the next opportunity to continue [Russia\u2019s] march through Moldova and the west Balkans and everything else,\u201d he warned.\n\nSen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he was \u201ctrying to understand\u201d why the administration would oppose a resolution condemning Russia for the war.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to understand the negotiating strategy. I can imagine this was a strategic vote in order to negotiate a hasty and expeditious outcome to a horrible war,\u201d he said. \u201cI will withhold judgment or further comment until I learn more about that.\u201d\n\nBut he said there\u2019s no question that Russia is the aggressor in the war.\n\n\u201cI agree that Russia is the aggressor. I\u2019m acknowledging it, and so many members of Congress are acknowledging that,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), speaking on the Senate floor, said Trump\u2019s refusal to call out Putin as the aggressor has undermined U.S. leverage heading into the peace talks.\n\n\u201cThe United States should have been willing to say this was an illegal war unjustly initiated by Russia. If you\u2019re unwilling to state a truth, you begin in a very weak position,\u201d he warned.\n\nOther Republican senators pushed back on the reluctance of some high-ranking Trump administration officials to blame Russia for sparking the conflict three years ago.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth in a \u201c Sunday\u201d interview told host Shannon Bream \u201cit\u2019s a very complicated question\u201d when asked if it would be fair to say Russia attacked Ukraine without provocation.\n\nOn Tuesday, Stephen Feinberg, the co-founder of Cerberus Capital Management whom Trump has nominated to serve as the Pentagon\u2019s No. 2-ranking official, declined to assign blame to Russia during his Senate confirmation hearing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel that I should publicly comment in the middle of tense negotiations when I\u2019m not privy to the facts,\u201d he said when asked by Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) to confirm that Russia indeed invaded its neighbor.\n\nTrump last week suggested Ukraine was primarily responsible for the war but later walked back his comment.\n\nThe president said last week that Ukraine \u201cshould have never started the war\u201d but later modified his statement by acknowledging \u201cRussia attacked.\u201d\n\nTrump stirred some concern among defense hawk Republicans by refusing to call Putin a dictator when asked Monday about his comments last week calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a \u201cdictator without elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t use those words lightly,\u201d he said when asked whether he views Putin as a dictator.\n\nSeveral Republican senators Tuesday, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.), avowed that Russia is solely to blame for the conflict.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not confused about the facts. That is a fact,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said.\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) said \u201cRussia\u2019s clearly the aggressor.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to quote from the 1946 Nuremberg Trials International Military Tribunal he had posted on social media in response to the U.S. voting against the U.N. resolution condemning Russia.\n\n\u201cTo initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole,\u201d it read.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a close Trump ally and prominent voice on national security issues, said \u201cRussia is the aggressor.\u201d\n\nSenate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) last week rejected Trump\u2019s lenient view of Putin, telling in an interview that the Russian president is a \u201cwar criminal who should be in jail for life.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Wicker told that \u201cit\u2019s clear to most Americans that this war was started by Vladimir Putin\u2019s aggression\u201d dating back as far as 2014, when Russia invaded and seized Crimea.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me that multiple administrations have not been as firm as we should have been,\u201d he said.",

        "full_text": "Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) has cautioned GOP colleagues that the Senate isn\u2019t likely to pass President Trump\u2019s border security, energy and tax agenda until July at the earliest, and some Republican senators are warning the bill could drag well into the fall.\n\nMuch of Washington\u2019s attention has focused on the rocky path Trump\u2019s agenda faces in the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s (R-La.) slim majority means he can only lose one GOP vote and still pass GOP legislation.\n\nBut Republican senators are warning that getting a major package through the Senate will take months longer than has been publicly discussed, due to the sheer size of Trump\u2019s ambitious agenda and internal Republican divisions over an array of policy questions.\n\nWhile Thune has told Republican senators he wants to move a budget resolution in the \u201cnext work period\u201d before the April recess to show progress on Trump\u2019s agenda, the \u201cfinished product\u201d is still months away.\n\n\u201cThune and others have said they don\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic we\u2019ll move the finished product until the end of July,\u201d a Republican senator said of Thune\u2019s projected timeline for moving Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\n\u201cThune said he thought that the House\u2019s timeline on this was totally unrealistic and that the House doesn\u2019t have their ducks in a row, and their budget resolution has to be completely reworked, and this idea that we do it by April or May is just ridiculous,\u201d the source said.\n\nJohnson said in January that House Republican leaders were \u201ctargeting April\u201d for final passage of a budget reconciliation package that would extend the expiring 2017 tax cuts and address border security, energy reform and defense spendings.\n\nJohnson told CNBC in a March 12 interview that he put the reconciliation bill \u201con a very aggressive timetable for the very important reason that we need to get to the certainty [for the business environment] as soon as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve put on an aggressive timetable to try to get a vote on the one big, beautiful bill, the reconciliation package, on the House floor before Easter. If we do that, you\u2019re pushing it over to the Senate for them to act upon \u2014 it\u2019s conceivable you could get this to the president\u2019s desk by the end of April or early May. Certainly before Memorial Day,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublican senators, however, say that timeline is totally unrealistic given internal party divisions on tax policy, defense spending and proposed cuts to entitlement spending.\n\nA second Republican senator said Senate Republican leadership has warned that the reconciliation package may not get passed until late July or even September.\n\n\u201cThune\u2019s been having these small-group discussions, [and] in the one I was in, Senate Republicans were all over the map. There was no consensus,\u201d the GOP senator warned.\n\nThe lawmaker predicted the lack of consensus among Senate Republicans may require the House take the lead to keep Trump\u2019s agenda from being delayed into the fall.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that the House has a little clearer meeting of the minds than we do,\u201d the source said.\n\nSenate Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said last month that the House-passed budget needed \u201ca major overhaul\u201d before it could pass the Senate.\n\nMost Republican senators support adopting Senate Finance Committee Chair Mike Crapo\u2019s (R-Idaho) strategy of using a \u201ccurrent policy\u201d baseline to estimate the cost of the reconciliation package, which wouldn\u2019t count an extension of the expiring 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as adding to the deficit.\n\nBut there are a few dissenters within the Senate Republican Conference who worry that simply coming up with a way to score an extension of the tax cuts as deficit-neutral wouldn\u2019t accurately reflect the fiscal impact of the legislation.\n\nSemafor reported earlier this month that Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.) have raised questions behind the scenes about using Crapo\u2019s \u201ccurrent policy\u201d baseline to project the cost of the reconciliation package.\n\nCassidy has expressed his concern about projected federal deficits and their impact on interest rates.\n\nIn addition to the disagreement over how to score the extension of the 2017 tax cuts, GOP lawmakers need to decide what additional tax cuts to put in the package.\n\nHouse Republicans from high-income, high-tax blue states want to lift the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions.\n\nAnd earlier this month, Trump renewed his call for Congress to exempt tipped income and Social Security benefits from taxation. Those proposals could cost up to $200 billion and $1.5 trillion over 10 years, respectively.\n\nGraham said he\u2019s still hoping to pass the reconciliation package through the Senate before the August recess.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s the goal. I hope so,\u201d he said.\n\nCrapo, who\u2019s leading the negotiations on the tax portion of the package, declined to predict how long the talks might take.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how close we are,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother major stumbling block is the instruction in the House-passed budget resolution to the House Energy and Commerce Committee to reduce the federal deficit by $880 billion over 10 years.\n\nBudget experts say that while the language does not mention Medicaid specifically, the only way to meet that target is to make huge cuts to the program, which pays for the medical services of low-income and disabled people, as well as nursing home costs for many seniors.\n\nRepublican senators including Sens. Josh Hawley (Mo.), John Boozman (Ark.) and Jim Justice (W.Va.) have either expressed opposition to deep Medicaid cuts or have emphasized the importance of the program to many of their constituents.\n\n\u201cI would not do severe cuts to Medicaid,\u201d Hawley told HuffPost in February.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of massive Medicaid cuts,\u201d he said.\n\nBoozman told that Medicaid cuts \u201csure would\u201d impact constituents in Arkansas.\n\n\u201cIt depends what they\u2019re going to do,\u201d he said, noting the House-passed budget resolution doesn\u2019t detail explicitly what mandatory spending programs will be cut.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have $800 billion in cuts in play right now. It\u2019s what the House wants to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I\u2019ll be concerned about is the final negotiated process, which we\u2019re a long way from.\u201d\n\nJustice told reporters Thursday that many West Virginians depend on Medicaid but added that he would support reforms that strengthen the solvency of the program.\n\n\u201cFrom the standpoint of Medicaid, West Virginia has a gigantic participation. Really and truly we have concerns, and we\u2019re going to have to watch as this thing filters all the way through,\u201d he said of the reconciliation package.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we know there\u2019s waste like we can\u2019t imagine,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can try as best we possibly can to make the right moves on the chessboard to fix it or to make it better.\u201d\n\nDefense spending is a third major point of disagreement.\n\nThe House-passed budget proposal calls for a $100 billion direct spending increase for defense needs, but Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) says that\u2019s inadequate to build up the defense industrial base to meet the growing threat posed by China and other adversaries.\n\nWicker wants the reconciliation package to include at least $175 billion for defense programs.\n\nHe said he voted for the continuing resolution to fund the government until Sept. 30 despite what he saw as its failure to meet the Pentagon\u2019s needs, because of the expectation that the reconciliation package would make up for the shortfall.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to need more than $150 billion in the reconciliation bill, if we\u2019re going to be able to defend the country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt needs to be well over $150 billion. We\u2019re looking north of $175 [billion].\u201d",

        "full_text": "Republicans are not the only lawmakers facing confrontational town halls over the congressional recess. Democratic lawmakers are increasingly facing the ire of the party\u2019s liberal base over their response to the Trump administration.\n\nRep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.) clashed with pro-Palestinian attendees at a town hall Wednesday, leading police to shut down the forum. That followed Rep. Glenn Ivey\u2019s (D-Md.) town hall Tuesday, where he faced criticism for being too \u201ccalm\u201d in the face of the Trump administration. And in California, Democratic Rep. Gil Cisneros faced constituents angry about Social Security, Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, potential cuts to Medicaid and fired federal workers.\n\n\u201cI wish you\u2019d be angry,\u201d one woman said, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just House Democrats in safe districts taking heat from liberal constituents. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) responded to frustrated constituents at a town hall Wednesday by saying that her job is to be \u201cmore than just an activist\u201d and that \u201cyelling\u201d from progressives has not stopped President Trump.\n\nThe raucous events come as Democrats have sought to use town halls to target GOP lawmakers in their own districts. The town halls have Republicans and Democrats on edge, as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are put on the defensive on home turf.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re home, my town halls look like a Republican town hall. I\u2019m not taking it personally. People are scared. They want to see us do something,\u201d Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) told News\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d over the weekend.\n\nThe confrontations also come as Democrats continue to struggle to find their footing during the second Trump administration. And recent polling paints a dismal picture of the state of the party.\n\nAn News poll released Sunday found that only 27 percent of voters said they had a positive view of the Democratic Party, while 55 percent of voters said they have a negative view of it. Additionally, 20 percent of Democrats in the poll said they had a negative view of the party.\n\nA separate poll also released Sunday had similar findings, showing the party with a record-low 29 percent favorability rating. Fifty-two percent of Democratic-aligned adults said the leadership of the Democratic Party is currently taking the party in the wrong direction, compared to 48 percent who said the party\u2019s leaders were taking them in the right direction.\n\nThis week\u2019s town halls appeared to be a manifestation of that data.\n\n\u201c[Democratic leadership] neglects to see the army of pitchforks behind them ready to fight back if they\u2019re willing to take action,\u201d said Sawyer Hackett, a progressive Democratic strategist.\n\n\u201cRight now, what we\u2019re seeing is those pitchforks aren\u2019t necessarily on our side,\u201d he continued. \u201cTheir anger is pointed at Democratic lawmakers.\u201d\n\nThere is growing frustration from Democrats across the ideological spectrum over Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), along with nine other Senate Democrats, helping Republicans advance a House GOP-drafted government funding resolution. Liberals had hoped the Democrats would use the Senate filibuster to block the bill.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had one source of leverage to push back on these people and do everything we can to grind the gears of government to a halt to fight back, and we didn\u2019t use it,\u201d Hackett said.\n\nEven Democrats who voted against the resolution in their respective chambers, like Ivey and Slotkin, have faced tough questions over the future of their party at town halls.\n\n\u201cVoting the right way is literally the least you can do,\u201d said Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. \u201cThe expectation is that Democratic elected officials proactively do things to show that they get that we\u2019re in an existential fight for the future of America.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnybody on the inside who does not understand that their role in this moment in time is to be an organizer in addition to a policymaker, is failing to meet the moment. That\u2019s an absolute fact,\u201d Green said.\n\nOne attendee at Ivey\u2019s town hall Tuesday told the congressman that his constituents \u201cwant him to show fight, and you are not fighting.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that you\u2019re in the minority, it\u2019s that you\u2019re not even working on a shared strategy, and that is failure,\u201d the attendee shouted, garnering applause.\n\n\u201cThe message you should clearly take to your colleagues from your constituents is this: We are not interested in hearing that you\u2019re in the minority. We know that. We want you to show some of the backbone and strategic brilliance that Mitch McConnell would have in the minority,\u201d the attendee said.\n\nProgressives say Democratic officials and lawmakers need to take Trump and Musk head on, not just through votes.\n\n\u201cI wish more Democratic lawmakers would call for boycotts of Musk\u2019s products,\u201d Hackett said. \u201cI wish more Democratic lawmakers would pressure their Democratic states to cut contracts with SpaceX, to cut contracts with Starlink, to cut contracts with Tesla charging stations.\u201d\n\n\u201cDemocratic leadership seems to think that they can just lay low and point at Republicans until the midterms,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocratic strategist Antjuan Seawright noted Democrats are \u201cfighting with alligator arms tied behind their back in this case,\u201d but said the key battle will be at the ballot box in 2026.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep our eye on the bigger prize, and that\u2019s winning elections, because that\u2019s how we change the tone,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean that leaders in our party get a free pass on making bad political decisions.\u201d\n\nRepublican lawmakers are also grappling with viral videos emerging from heated town halls. Republicans have blamed the interruptions on Democratic agitators, and earlier this month House GOP leadership urged members to hold virtual events or telephone town halls as opposed to in-person events. Democrats have used the opportunity to put their Republican counterparts on defense by traveling to GOP districts to hold town halls.\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing in town halls across the country is a rejection of the failed Republican agenda, and it\u2019s why vulnerable House Republicans are hiding from their constituents. They know they are witnessing the beginning of the end of their majority,\u201d said Viet Shelton, a spokesperson at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nProgressives say there are Democratic lawmakers who are taking a step in the right direction. A number of Democratic senators have gone on the offense this week, holding town halls in GOP House districts within their respective states.\n\n\u201cIf one is reading tea leaves, the willingness of Democratic senators to go to House Republican districts within their state and step on toes to fight for the future of America, is hopefully a good signal of backbone to come,\u201d Green said.\n\nProgressive figures such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) are taking matters into their own hands, hitting the road on their \u201cFighting Oligarchy\u201d tour. Sanders told The New York Times on Thursday that a goal of the tour is to encourage more people to \u201crun as independents outside of the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nAt the Las Vegas stop of the tour Thursday with Rep. Steven Horsford (D-Nev.), Ocasio-Cortez told attendees to \u201clook at every level office around and support brawlers who fight.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause those are the ones who can actually win against Republicans. Let\u2019s be real about that,\u201d she said.",

        "full_text": "Republican lawmakers are conflicted over how to respond to President Trump\u2019s confrontational standoff with the federal judiciary, which drew a rare public rebuke Tuesday from Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nTrump and his allies are directing their attacks more frequently against judges who threaten to slow or block the president\u2019s ambitious agenda, putting GOP lawmakers in an uncomfortable spot.\n\nRepublican officeholders are leery of criticizing Trump for fear of becoming the target of his wrath or a primary challenge, yet privately they worry about the president\u2019s efforts to expand his executive power, which could reverberate far into the future.\n\nWhile a few Republican senators and House members have publicly cheered the Trump administration in its battle with a federal judge who ordered it to halt the deportation of several hundred Venezuelans to El Salvador, many more are keeping quiet.\n\n\u201cRepublicans, by and large, will support Trump publicly because of the situation \u2014 we\u2019re dealing with Venezuelan gang members, and most Americans agree they should have been deported,\u201d a senior Republican strategist said of the reaction to the Trump administration going forward with a deportation flights despite an order by a federal judge to stop them.\n\n\u201cPrivately, most congressional Republicans will think this is really going right up to the line on having a constitutional crisis, and that situations like this need to be avoided in the future,\u201d the strategist added. \u201cThey do believe in due process.\n\n\u201cThere will be future situations where hearings are necessary, and continuing to go against judicial rulings will be politically precarious for Trump,\u201d the strategist warned, noting Trump\u2019s direct challenge to federal judge\u2019s authority caught many lawmakers off guard Tuesday.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have urged Trump to heed the federal court rulings he disagrees with and to challenge them in the appeals process instead of flouting court orders.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said last month that \u201cthe White House should comply with court rulings,\u201d voicing a concern shared by a number of GOP lawmakers.\n\n\u201cWe have a judicial system. If you don\u2019t like the ruling, you can appeal the ruling and you can follow that through. But we are a nation of laws, and it is not necessarily for you or I to be the final arbiter here. This is why we entrust the judiciary with this responsibility,\u201d she said.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) has said the courts have a \u201cvalid role and need to be listened to.\u201d\n\nThey and many other GOP lawmakers didn\u2019t address the issue Tuesday after Trump called for the impeachment of Judge James Boasberg, the chief judge of the federal district court of the District of Columbia, who ordered the halting of flights carrying people to El Salvador.\n\nTrump called the judge, who was appointed to his seat by former President Obama, \u201ca troublemaker and agitator.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis judge, like many of the Crooked Judges\u2019 I am forced to appear before, should be impeached!!\u201d he declared on Truth Social, suggesting many the deportees were \u201cVICIOUS, VIOLENT AND DEMENTED CRIMINALS.\u201d\n\nThat statement drew pushback from Roberts, who declared that threatening to impeach the judge over a legal disagreement is \u201cinappropriate.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration sought to deport the migrants under the Aliens Enemies Act of 1798, a seldom-cited law that previously has been invoked during times of war.\n\nTrump\u2019s call for impeaching Boasberg was immediately supported by Rep. Brandon Gill (R-Texas), who introduced a resolution to impeach Boasberg.\n\nThe idea of impeaching federal judges who rule against Trump was not popular with Senate Republicans when tech billionaire Elon Musk, one of Trump\u2019s closest advisors, floated it last month.\n\n\u201cWrong, wrong, wrong. Get him out of\u00a0the White House. Get him out, the sooner the better,\u201d one GOP senator told last month.\n\n\u201cEvery day that he\u2019s there, he seems more destructive,\u201d the source said of Musk.\n\nThe Republican strategist warned that Trump\u2019s battle with Republican-appointed jurists such as Roberts is a bad look for the president, politically.\n\n\u201cTrump is once again breaking norms,\u201d the strategist said. \u201cIt does raise the visibility of [the issue] and I don\u2019t think it intimidates the judges, either.\n\n\u201cIf power ends up in a Democratic White House and [a Democratic president] ignores judicial rulings, Republicans will be reminded of his situation. Hopefully, this is an anomaly,\u201d the source added. \u201cBehind the scenes, they believe in an independent judiciary and they don\u2019t want Trump messing with it.\u201d\n\nFormer Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) said Trump\u2019s attack on the judge puts Republican lawmakers in a difficult position.\n\n\u201cWhen you arbitrarily try to cancel the rule of law, which is what Trump is trying to do, and lead by the edict of an individual, whether he is president or not, you\u2019re creating almost a banana republic-type of event,\u201d he warned.\n\n\u201cThe fact that members of the Republican Party would introduce articles of impeachment [against the judge] is an inexcusable abrogation of their obligation as members of the Congress,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHow does it affect Republicans? Significantly. Because even though senior Republicans in the Senate may disagree and hopefully would disagree strongly, it\u2019s the president who\u2019s head of the party and is defining the party,\u201d Gregg warned. \u201cIf you\u2019re running as a Republican against a Democrat, or anybody else, you\u2019re going to be painted with the brush that you don\u2019t think the rule of law should apply in America anymore.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department on Tuesday complied with Boasberg\u2019s order for sworn statements acknowledging that the deported Venezuelan migrants, allegedly members of the Tren de Aragua gang, arrived in El Salvador after the judge issued verbal and written orders to stop the deportations.\n\nThe judge asked Justice Department officials to explain why two deportation flights continued on from Honduras to El Salvador after he issued his orders.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s lawyers argued Monday that Boasberg\u2019s order wasn\u2019t violated because the judge does not have the jurisdiction to overrule the president\u2019s powers as commander in chief.\n\nTwo prominent Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee rallied to Trump\u2019s defense.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on Sunday accused Boasberg of \u201cunilaterally deciding policy for the whole country\u201d and vowed to investigate.\n\n\u201cThis time to benefit foreign gang members,\u201d he posted on the social platform X, referring to the court order. \u201cIf the Supreme Court or Congress doesn\u2019t fix, we\u2019re headed toward a constitutional crisis.\n\n\u201cSenate Judiciary Cmte taking action,\u201d he added.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), another member of the Judiciary Committee, posted on X that \u201cDemocrats would rather defend known terrorists and cartel gangsters than let President Trump do his job of keeping our country safe.\u201d\n\n Nexstar Media Inc.

        "full_text": "The U.S. Supreme Court temporarily delayed a court-mandated deadline requiring the Trump administration to pay nearly $2 billion to contracted aid organizations for work they already completed.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, in an order Wednesday night, stayed a lower court order that the administration pay out $1.9 billion by midnight. In his order, Roberts asked the aid groups that sued the Trump administration to provide a response by noon Friday after which the court will decide its next steps.\n\nRoberts' order came after the Trump administration sought emergency intervention by the high court after a panel of federal appeals court judges denied the administration's earlier request to push the deadline.\n\nActing Solicitor General Sarah Harris asked the justices to impose an administrative stay -- freezing the status quo for a short time.\n\n\"What the government cannot do is pay arbitrarily determined demands on an arbitrary timeline of the district court\u2019s choosing or according to extra-contractual rules that the court has devised,\" Harris wrote in the emergency request, saying the deadline created \"an untenable payment plan\" at odds with the president's obligations.\n\n\"The order appears to contemplate the immediate outlay of nearly $2 billion. And the government has no sure mechanism to recover wrongfully disbursed funds delivered to entities that claim to be near insolvency,\" Harris said in the request.\n\nIn proceedings earlier Wednesday denying a request to stay his deadline, U.S. District Court Judge Amir Ali, a Biden-era appointee, balked at the government's insistence that it couldn't meet the midnight payout deadline and criticized the Trump administration for waiting until Tuesday to raise the argument that they lack the ability to restart the funding.\n\n\"This is not something that Defendants have previously raised in this Court, whether at the hearing or any time before filing their notice of appeal and seeking a stay pending appeal. That is so even though Plaintiffs' motion to enforce explicitly proposed compliance on this time frame,\" Ali wrote.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ali had ordered the Trump administration to dole out delayed payments that could total nearly $2 billion, according to a USAID official, to multiple nonprofit groups, determining the Trump administration violated the terms of a temporary restraining order issued two weeks ago regarding freezing foreign aid.\n\nA top official with the United States Agency for International Development claimed that complying with Tuesday's court order would require paying foreign aid groups nearly $2 billion, arguing the payments \"cannot be accomplished\" in the timeframe set by the court.\n\nLawyers with the Department of Justice asked Ali in a late-night filing on Tuesday to issue a stay of his order that requires the Trump administration to pay by Wednesday at 11:59 p.m. any outstanding debts to foreign aid groups for work completed prior to Feb. 13. The Trump administration initially tried to freeze the payments via an executive order before Judge Ali ordered the payments to resume two weeks ago.\n\nDOJ lawyers argued that fulfilling the payments is not only technically impossible but would also prevent the Trump administration from ensuring the payments are \"legitimate.\"\n\n\"The order apparently requires the Government to expend taxpayer dollars without regard to any processes for ensuring that the expenses are legitimate\u2014even though Executive Branch leadership harbors concerns about the possibility of waste and fraud and is in the process of developing revised payment processing systems to address those concerns,\" DOJ attorney Indraneel Sur wrote in a late-night filing.\n\nAccording to Peter Marocco, the deputy administrator of USAID and director of foreign assistance at the State Department, complying with the court order would require dispersing $1.5 billion between 2,000 payment requests at USAID and an additional $400 million in payments at the State Department.\n\nEarlier this week, Judge Ali excoriated Trump administration attorneys during a lengthy hearing over its failure to pay the groups for work they conducted prior to President Trump's Jan. 20 executive order, which froze all foreign aid for 90 days. Ali also signed an order to enforce a temporary restraining order he signed on Feb. 13, ruling the groups must be paid by 11:59 p.m. Wednesday.\n\n\"Plaintiffs submitted evidence that defendants have not lifted the suspension or freeze of funds as the [temporary restraining order] required. Defendants have not rebutted that evidence, and when asked today, defendants were not able to provide any specific examples of unfreezing funds pursuant to the Court's TRO,\" Judge Ali said after a two-hour hearing today.\n\nLawyers with the Department of Justice acknowledged that the Trump administration ignored the temporary restraining order, which prohibited them from freezing foreign aid funds since the order was issued. Instead, they argued that they should not be required to pay back the money because of \"sovereign immunity.\"\n\nDuring an extended exchange with Ali, a DOJ lawyer struggled to answer basic questions about the Trump administration's compliance with the temporary restraining order, which prevented the administration from freezing funds.\n\n\"I'm not sure why I can't get a straight answer from you on this. Are you aware of an unfreezing of the disbursement of funds for those contracts and agreements that were frozen before February 13?\" Ali asked. \"Are you aware of steps taken to actually release those funds?\"\n\n\"I'm not in a position to answer that,\" DOJ attorney Indraneel Sur said.\n\n\"We're 12 days in and you're here representing the government...and you can't answer me whether any funds that you've kind of acknowledged or covered by the court's order have been unfrozen?\" Judge Ali responded.\n\n\"All I can do, really, is say that the preparations are underway for the joint status report on compliance,\" Sur said.\n\nAt one portion of the lengthy court hearing, Sur attempted to offer a legal justification for the Trump administration's noncompliance, prompting a stern response from the judge about his order, the terms of which he said were \"clear as day.\"\n\n\"The purpose of this hearing is to understand and to hear arguments on the motion to enforce TRO. It is not an opportunity to re-litigate the TRO,\" Ali said.\n\nA lawyer representing the nonprofits who brought the case argued that the lack of a response from the Trump administration amounts to defiance of the court order.\n\n\"What the court's colloquy with the government has revealed is that the government has done nothing to make the flow of payments happen,\" he said. \"As far as we are aware, there's been zero directives from the agency with respect to the unfreezing of funds.\"",

        "full_text": "SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah will become the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, despite widespread opposition from dentists and national health organizations.\n\nRepublican Gov. Spencer Cox said he would sign legislation that bars cities and communities from deciding whether to add the mineral to their water systems.\n\nFluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.\n\nGovernment researchers have found that community water fluoridation prevents about 25% of tooth decay.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got tried and true evidence of the safety and efficacy of this public health initiative,\u201d said American Dental Association President Brad Kessler, of Denver. Cavities could start emerging in children within months or years of Utah stopping fluoridation, Kessler said.\n\nThe ban comes weeks after federal health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has expressed skepticism about water fluoridation, was sworn into office.\n\n\u201cIt's not a bill I care that much about,\u201d Cox added, \u201cbut it's a bill I will sign.\u201d\n\nUtah lawmakers who pushed for a ban said putting fluoride in water was too expensive. Its Republican sponsor, Rep. Stephanie Gricius, acknowledged fluoride has benefits, but said it was an issue of \u201cindividual choice\u201d to not have it in the water.\n\nCox said that like many people in Utah, he grew up and raised his own children in a community that doesn\u2019t have fluoridated water \u2014 or what he called a \u201cnatural experiment.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would think you would see drastically different outcomes with half the state not getting it. We haven\u2019t seen that,\u201d Cox said in a weekend interview with ABC4 in Salt Lake City. \u201cSo it\u2019s got to be a really high bar for me if we\u2019re going to require people to be medicated by their government.\u201d\n\nAlready, some cities across the country have gotten rid of fluoride from their water, and other municipalities are considering doing the same. A few months ago, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate fluoride in drinking water because high levels could pose a risk to kids\u2019 intellectual development.\n\nA Utah teenager who urged lawmakers to pass the bill described suffering a medical emergency when the fluoride pump in Sandy, Utah, malfunctioned in 2019, releasing an excessive amount of the mineral into the drinking water. The fluoride sickened hundreds of residents and led many in Utah to push for its removal.\n\nIt\u2019s rare to find high levels of fluoridation in water, according to the National Institutes of Health. The agency said it\u2019s \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d to get a toxic dose of fluoride from water with standard levels of the mineral.\n\nKessler said the amounts of fluoride added to drinking water have been reduced over time and are below levels considered problematic.\n\n\u201cThe science proves that it is effective at reducing cavities with little to no risk of other problems,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that a ban in Utah could have a domino effect with other legislatures being encouraged to follow suit with fluoride bans in their states.\n\nOpponents warned it would disproportionately affect low-income residents who may rely on public drinking water having fluoride as their only source of preventative dental care. Low-income families may not be able to afford regular dentist visits or the fluoride tablets some people buy as a supplement in cities without fluoridation.\n\nFluoridation is the most cost-effective way to prevent tooth decay on a large scale, said Lorna Koci, who chairs the Utah Oral Health Coalition.\n\nUtah in 2022 ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents that receive fluoridated water, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About two in five Utah residents served by community water systems received fluoridated water.\n\nIn February, the city council in Riverton, a Salt Lake City suburb, unanimously passed a resolution to remove fluoride from the city\u2019s public water systems. Voters in Brigham City, 59 miles (95 kilometers) north of the capital city, struck down by a large margin a measure in 2023 that would have removed the mineral from its public water supply.\n\nOut of the 484 Utah water systems that reported data to the CDC in 2024, only 66 fluoridated their water, an analysis showed. The largest was the state\u2019s biggest city, Salt Lake City.\n\nRodney Thornell, president of the Utah Dental Association, began practicing dentistry in a Salt Lake City suburb before the city added fluoride to its water. His adult patients who grew up locally continue to get lots of cavities but younger patients who grew up with fluoride in the water get fewer, he said.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to keep eating sugar, we need fluoride.\u201d Thornell said, noting that Utah residents consume more than the national average of candy and sugary drinks.\n\n___\n\nBrown reported from Billings, Montana.",

        "full_text": "One day ahead of a court hearing for Mahmoud Khalil -- the Palestinian activist who was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on the campus of Columbia University, despite possessing a green card -- his wife and attorney both released statements shedding more light on Khalil's detainment and the days leading up to it.\n\nKhalil's wife, who is eight months pregnant, issued a statement speaking of the outpouring of love she has received and the urgent need for him to be home in time for their baby's birth.\n\nIn it, she said that Khalil \"begged\" Columbia University for legal support one day before his arrest, explaining that he was fearful that ICE might target him.\n\nKhalil allegedly sent an email to the university urging them to intervene, his wife said.\n\n\"I haven't been able to sleep, fearing that ICE or a dangerous individual might come to my home. I urgently need legal support and I urge you to intervene,\" he reportedly said in his email.\n\nHis wife claimed that the university never responded.\n\nABC News reached out to Columbia for comment and has not independently reviewed the reported emails.\n\nKhalil's wife also said in her statement that a \"doxxing\" campaign began targeting her husband about six days ago and anti-Palestinian groups were also spreading \"false claims\" about him.\n\nShe recalled the moment she was also threatened with arrest when she refused to leave her husband with the agents, claiming that the couple was never shown a warrant.\n\n\"I was born and raised in the Midwest. My parents came here from Syria, carrying their stories of the oppressive regime there that made life unlivable. They believed living in the US would bring a sense of safety and stability. But here I am, 40 years after my parents immigrated here, and just weeks before I'm due to give birth to our first child, and I feel more unsafe and unstable than I have in my entire life,\" her statement said.\n\nThe Trump administration said it detained Khalil, who was a leader of the encampment protests on Columbia's campus, alleging he was a supporter of Hamas.\n\nBaher Azmy, one of the lawyers representing Khalil, called his client's alleged alignment with Hamas \"false and preposterous.\"\n\nAccording to a joint letter filed in court and obtained by ABC News, the government and Khalil's attorneys conferred on Monday but were unable to agree on how to proceed. Khalil's side asked the court to first decide a pending motion to compel the government to return him to New York; the government indicated that it intends to move to dismiss or transfer the case for improper venue and is asking the court to address that first.\n\n\"For everyone reading this, I urge you to see Mahmoud through my eyes as a loving husband and the future father to our baby. I need your help to bring Mahmoud home, so he is here beside me, holding my hand in the delivery room as we welcome our first child into this world. Please release Mahmoud Now,\" the statement from Khalil's wife concluded.\n\nAttorney Amy E. Greer said she spoke with Khalil on Tuesday and that he is \"healthy and his spirits are undaunted by his predicament.\"\n\n\"He also greatly appreciates, and, typically for him, is moved by the extraordinarily broad and steadfast support he has received from a variety of communities that understand what is at stake,\" she said.\n\nGreer also hinted that some of the administration's comments about Khalil, including President Donald Trump's social media posts, may be used by his legal team to argue for his release.\n\n\"The remarks by government officials, including the President, on social media only confirm the purpose \u2013 and illegality \u2013 of Mahmoud's detention. He was chosen as an example to stifle entirely lawful dissent in violation of the First Amendment. While tomorrow or thereafter the government may cite the law or process, that toothpaste is out of the tube and irreversibly so. The government's objective is as transparent as it is unlawful, and our role as Mahmoud's lawyers is to ensure it does not prevail,\" Greer said.\n\nThe court has scheduled a hearing on the habeas petition on Wednesday at 11:30 a.m.\n\nKhalil's team will be asking the court to order the government to return him to New York to while the legal battle plays out. Khalil is currently being held in Louisiana -- a move that Greer claimed is a \"blatantly improper but familiar tactic designed to frustrate the New York federal court's jurisdiction.\"",

        "full_text": "Former United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Jessica Aber was found dead on the morning of March 22 in Virginia, according to local police. She was 43.\n\nPolice in Alexandria, Virginia, were called to a home on Beverly Drive in the suburb of Washington, D.C., at around 9:18 a.m. for the report of an unresponsive woman, according to a police statement. They found Aber dead inside.\n\nPolice said an investigation is underway surrounding the circumstances of her death.\n\nTwo sources close to the investigation told ABC News that the death appears to be from natural causes. At this point there is no indication of foul play, the sources added.\n\nA friend of the family told ABC News on Sunday that police believe the death was the result of a longstanding medical issue.\n\nHowever, officials are still awaiting a formal report as to the cause and manner of her death from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.\n\nAber, who served as U.S. attorney in Virginia for most of the Biden administration, took office in October 2021 after being unanimously confirmed by the Senate and stepped down in January, shortly after President Donald Trump's inauguration.\n\nAs U.S. attorney, Aber oversaw a staff of some 300 prosecutors and other staff and handled federal prosecutions in the state.\n\nShe started working in the office in 2009 as an assistant U.S. attorney, prosecuting financial fraud, public corruption, violent crime and child exploitation cases, according to an online biography.\n\nShe received her law degree from William and Mary Law School in 2006.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi shared a statement on X on Saturday night, writing: \"The loss of Jessica Aber, former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, is deeply tragic. Our hearts and prayers go out to her family and friends during this profoundly difficult time.\"\n\n\"We are heartbroken beyond words to learn of the passing of our friend and former colleague, U.S. Attorney Jessica Aber,\" current U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Erik Siebert said in a statement. \"She was unmatched as a leader, mentor, and prosecutor, and she is simply irreplaceable as a human being. We remain in awe of how much she accomplished in her all too brief time in this world.\"\n\nCalling her a \"proud Virginian from high school through college and throughout her career,\" Siebert's statement went on to say: \"Her professionalism, grace, and legal acumen set the standard. Though we are devastated by this loss, each of us in the Eastern District of Virginia (EDVA) will look to her example and endeavor to live up to that standard.\"\n\nIn a statement, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares said he was saddened to learn of her death, saying her \"career of public service included US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia and whose work with Ceasefire Virginia saved more lives than we may ever realize.\"\n\nHe added, \"Our thoughts and our prayers are with her family this week.\"\n\nABC News' Alexandra Faul contributed to this report.",

        "full_text": "Democrats have spent months debating how and why they lost the 2024 election. But the full picture of what happened on Election Day is only now coming into view.\n\nThe most authoritative election analyses draw on a variety of different data sources, including large sample polling, precinct-level returns, and voter file data that shows definitively who did and did not vote. And those last figures became available only recently.\n\nThe Democratic firm Blue Rose Research recently synthesized such data into a unified account of Kamala Harris\u2019s defeat. (Blue Rose Research did ad testing for Future Forward, the largest PAC supporting Harris, which had disputes on strategy with the campaign itself.) Its analysis will command a lot of attention. Few pollsters boast a larger data set than Blue Rose \u2014 the company conducted 26 million voter interviews in 2024. And the firm\u2019s leader, David Shor, might be the most influential data scientist in the Democratic Party.\n\nI spoke with Shor about his autopsy of the Harris campaign. We discussed the problems with the popular theory that Democrats lost because of low turnout; why zoomers are more right-wing than millennials; how TikTok makes voters more Republican; where Donald Trump\u2019s administration is most vulnerable; what Democrats can do to win back working-class voters; and whether artificial intelligence is poised to turbo-charge America\u2019s culture wars, among other things. Our conversation has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nBefore we get into why Democrats lost the 2024 election, let\u2019s talk about how they lost it: Which voting blocs shifted the furthest right over the past four years?\n\nThe most important thing is that we saw incredible polarization on political engagement itself. There\u2019s a bunch of different ways to measure this: There\u2019s how many elections you vote in, or how important politics is to your identity. There\u2019s how closely you follow the news. But across all of these, there\u2019s a consistent story: The most engaged people swung toward Democrats between 2020 and 2024, despite the fact that Democrats did worse overall.\n\nMeanwhile, people who are the least politically engaged swung enormously against Democrats. They\u2019re a group that Biden either narrowly won or narrowly lost four years ago. But this time, they voted for Trump by double digits.\n\nAnd I think this is just analytically important. People have a lot of complaints about how the mainstream media covered things. But I think it\u2019s important to note that the people who watch the news the most actually became more Democratic. And the problem was basically this large group of people who really don\u2019t follow the news at all becoming more conservative.\n\nIf they\u2019re not responding to mainstream media information, where are they getting their views on politics? Is this group reacting to the prices at the grocery store, or firsthand experience of changes in the economy, immigration, or culture?\n\nMost people have to balance their reaction to objective facts in the economy with their preexisting ideological beliefs. A strongly Democratic voter isn\u2019t going to switch to Trump just because they\u2019re upset about high prices. So, it isn\u2019t too surprising that the people with the weakest political loyalties would be the most responsive to changes in economic conditions.\n\nThis story was first featured in The Rebuild.\n\nSign up here for more stories on the lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat \u2014 and a closer look at where they should go next. From senior correspondent Eric Levitz.\n\nAnd people who are politically disengaged \u2014 like every other subgroup of people this election \u2014 overwhelmingly listed the cost of living as the thing they were the most concerned about.\n\nBut it can\u2019t just be inflation. Politically disengaged voters went from being a roughly neutral group in 2020 to favoring the Republicans by about 15 points in 2024. But during the Obama era, this was a solidly Democratic group, favoring us by between 10 and 15 points. So there\u2019s also this long-term trend that goes beyond inflation or social media. Our coalition has been transitioning from working-class people to college-educated people.\n\nTo move beyond the why, this shift in the partisanship of politically disengaged voters has a really important implication: For most of the last 15 years, we\u2019ve really lived in this world where the mantra was \u201cIf everybody votes, we win.\u201d But we\u2019re now at a point where the more people vote, the better Republicans do.\n\nIf I understand you correctly, you\u2019re suggesting that Democrats cannot rebuild a national majority merely by juicing higher turnout, since registered voters as a whole were more pro-Trump in 2024 than those who actually showed up at the polls.\n\nNevertheless, many progressives have attributed Harris\u2019s loss to depressed turnout among Democratic voters specifically. They point to the fact that, between 2020 and 2024, the Democratic presidential nominee\u2019s vote total fell by significantly more than Trump\u2019s tally increased. And they also note that, according to VoteCast, only 4 percent of Biden 2020 voters backed Trump last year \u2014 while a roughly equal percentage of Trump 2020 voters switched to Kamala. So, in their telling, if defections roughly canceled out while a large number of voters went from supporting Biden to staying home, then clearly the problem was inadequate Democratic turnout. So if Harris had focused more on energizing the progressive base, she might have won. What do you think is wrong with that narrative?\n\nWell, the problem with the VoteCast data is that it was released the day after the election. There was just a lot of information that they didn\u2019t have at the time. At this point, voter file data has been released for enough states to account for an overwhelming majority of the 2024 vote. And what\u2019s really cool about having that data is that you can really decompose what fraction of the change in vote share was people changing their mind versus changes in who voted.\n\nAnd when you do that, you see that roughly 30 percent of the change in Democratic vote share from 2020 to 2024 was changes in who voted \u2014 changes in turnout. But the other 70 percent was people changing their mind. And that\u2019s in line with the breakdown we\u2019ve seen for most elections in the past 30 years.\n\nThe reality is that these things always tend to move in the same direction \u2014 parties that lose ground with swing voters tend to simultaneously see worse turnout. And for a simple reason. There were a lot of Democratic voters who were angry at their party last year. And they were mostly moderate and conservative Democrats angry about the cost of living and other issues. And even though they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for a Republican, a lot of them stayed home. But basically, their complaints were very similar to those of Biden voters who flipped to Trump.\n\nThe reality is if all registered voters had turned out, then Donald Trump would\u2019ve won the popular vote by 5 points [instead of 1.7 points]. So, I think that a \u201cwe need to turn up the temperature and mobilize everyone\u201d strategy would\u2019ve made things worse.\n\nAccording to your data, voters who got their news from TikTok were much more likely to swing to the GOP than other voters, even after controlling for demographics. Why do you think that is?\n\nI think people can debate how much of this is the nature of the algorithm versus the strategic choices that the parties made. A lot of people argue that maybe TikTok just helps negative content get promoted, and that\u2019s naturally bad for whoever\u2019s the incumbent. But TikTok is also really different from social media that came before.\n\nOther social media sites are very dependent on what people call \u201cthe follower graph.\u201d If you look on Instagram Reels, for example, the correlation between how many views a video gets and how many followers the creator has is extremely high. On TikTok, it\u2019s quite a bit lower than any other platform. And the reason is TikTok uses machine learning to analyze a video \u2014 and make a good guess about whether it will be appealing \u2014 before they show it to anyone. So if your video is likely to be engaging, it can get wide distribution even if you don\u2019t have a following. And that has been genuinely democratizing.\n\nWe used to live in this world where in order to get your message out there, you had to get people who write really well to absorb your message and put it out. And now, we\u2019re in a world where anyone can make a video and if that video is appealing, it\u2019ll get out there. And this is naturally bad for the left, simply because the people who write really well are a lot more left-wing than the overall population.\n\nOne of my favorite stats on this is something that Nate Cohn put out a couple years ago: Working-class white voters who\u2019ve read a book in the last year are much more Democratic than working-class white voters who haven\u2019t.\n\nSo what other groups did Democrats lose ground with, beyond those who pay little attention to politics and TikTok enthusiasts?\n\nIf you look at predominantly immigrant neighborhoods, whether they\u2019re white or Hispanic or Asian or African, you really see these absolutely massive shifts against Democrats. Trump won Corona in Queens. Immigrants go from a D+27 group in 2020 to a potentially R+1 group in 2024.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why that happened. I think we\u2019re still waiting for data to come back. But I\u2019d guess it\u2019s the same stories about the cost of living and cultural issues and ideological polarization.\n\nSpeaking of ideological polarization: One of the findings in your data is that nonwhite voters who identify as \u201cconservative\u201d or \u201cmoderate\u201d have been voting more and more like their white ideological counterparts over the past few elections. So, the electorate is polarizing less on race and more on ideology.\n\nI feel like there\u2019s an argument that this was inevitable: Hispanic and Asian Americans were always likely to follow the political trajectory of other immigrant groups, many of which were tethered to the Democratic Party for the first couple of generations but then started to polarize ideologically as they became more affluent and assimilated. And you could perhaps tell a similar story about Black Americans, in which the easing of extreme racial oppression and segregation makes it easier for conservative African Americans to consider voting for the GOP.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe Democrats just made some avoidable mistakes that alienated these constituencies. So I\u2019m wondering how you understand this development?\n\nIf we look at 2016 to 2024 trends by race and ideology, you see this clear story where white voters really did not shift at all. Kamala Harris did exactly as well as Hillary Clinton did among white conservatives, white liberals, white moderates.\n\nBut if you look among Hispanic and Asian voters, you see these enormous double-digit declines. To highlight one example: In 2016, Democrats got 81 percent of Hispanic moderates. Fast-forward to 2024; Democrats got only 57 percent of Hispanic moderates, which is really very similar to the 51 percent that Harris got among white moderates.\n\nYou know, white people only really started to polarize heavily on ideology in the 1990s. Now, nonwhite voters are starting to polarize on ideology the same way that white voters did.\n\nIf you look at African Americans, they did not swing nearly as much. But in our polling, before the Kamala switchover, Black voters were poised to swing 7 to 8 percentage points against us.\n\nAs to whether this is inevitable, I would say that to some degree getting 94 percent of any ethnic group is unsustainable. But I think the losses that we\u2019re seeing among nonwhite voters and immigrants is symptomatic of this broader, ideological polarization that Democrats are suffering from.\n\nFundamentally, 40 percent of the country identifies as conservative. Roughly 40 percent is moderate, 20 percent is liberal, though it depends exactly how you ask it. Sometimes it\u2019s 25 percent liberal. But the reality is that, to the extent that Democrats try to polarize the electorate on self-described ideology, this is just something that plays into the hands of Republicans.\n\nThis isn\u2019t necessarily as ideologically restrictive as people think. If you look at moderates \u2014 and especially nonwhite moderates \u2014 a bunch of them hold very progressive views on a variety of economic and social issues. A very large fraction of Trump voters identify as pro-choice. We\u2019ve seen populist economic messaging do very well in our testing with voters of all kinds. But I think that there are also some big cultural divides between highly educated people who live in cities and everybody else. And to the extent that we make the cultural signifiers of these highly educated people the face and the brand of our party, that is going to make everyone else turn against us.\n\nOne surprising thing\n\nYoung people have been one of the most reliably Democratic constituencies for more than a decade. According to the Democratic data firm Catalist, Joe Biden won voters under 30 by 23 points in 2020. But Blue Rose Research\u2019s data suggests that Trump narrowly won that demographic in 2024.\n\nHow do young voters fit into this? In my understanding, young voters shifted significantly against Democrats in 2024.\n\nYeah. So this is related to the other trends: Young people are more nonwhite than the overall electorate. They\u2019re more politically disengaged than the overall electorate. But the single biggest predictor of swing from 2020 to 2024 is age. Voters under 30 supported Biden by large margins. But Donald Trump probably narrowly won 18- to 29-year-olds. That isn\u2019t what the exit polls say. But if you look at our survey data, voter file data, and precinct-level data, that\u2019s the picture you get.\n\nAnd if you look at people under the age of 25, every single group \u2014 white, nonwhite, male or female \u2014 is considerably more conservative than their millennial counterparts. And it even seems that Donald Trump narrowly won nonwhite 18-year-old men, which is not something that has ever happened in Democratic politics before.\n\nSo, young people are quite a bit more right-wing than they were four years ago. And a lot of that is replacement. It\u2019s a different set of young people. It turns out, people age.\n\nWhat\u2019s your sense of why this generation of young people is more conservative than we were? Is it about each cohort\u2019s distinctive formative experiences? In my understanding, political events that transpire during your adolescence and early adulthood can shape your worldview in a durable way. So, maybe the millennial generation came of age during the disaster that was George W. Bush\u2019s second term, and then associated Democrats with an incredibly charismatic two-term president in Barack Obama \u2014 while young zoomers associated Democrats with Covid and inflation under Biden? Or is something else at play?\n\nYeah, I think some of that story is true. Yair Ghitza has an incredible paper that shows that people have formative political years. And you can predict a lot of how conservative someone will be from how popular the incumbent president was when they were teenagers or when they were in their 20s. And so I think that\u2019s definitely true and it\u2019s definitely part of the story. But I think that there\u2019s more to the story than that.\n\nIf you look at the millennials, the millennials were more left-wing in a bunch of countries \u2014 Canada, the UK, and Europe. I think that there\u2019s a story you can tell: Baby boomers were an incredibly left-wing generation in most places in the world. And millennials were their kids.\n\nBut Gen X was really quite a bit more conservative than the Boomers in most countries. And there\u2019s a lot of theories you can make about that \u2014 response to the oil shocks, stagflation, neoliberalism. But whatever the reason, Gen X came out more conservative. So I think that part of the story is simply that the current crop of young people had Gen X parents. And in our surveys, if we ask people, \u201cHow Democratic were your parents growing up?\u201d zoomers are something like 7 percent more likely to say they had Republican parents than millennials are.\n\nBut isn\u2019t part of the Democrats\u2019 problem with younger voters about men, specifically?\n\nYeah. There\u2019s also this enormous amount of gender polarization. If you look at the gender gap \u2014 just what fraction of the vote Kamala Harris got versus what fraction of the vote Donald Trump got among men and women \u2014 for voters over the age of 30, there was about a 10 percent gender gap between men and women. And that\u2019s, roughly speaking, where it\u2019s been in American politics for most of the last 20 years.\n\nBut if you look at voters under the age of 25, the gender gap has doubled in size. And if you look at 18-year-olds specifically, 18-year-old men were 23 percentage points more likely to vote for Donald Trump than 18-year-old women. And gender polarization seems to be increasing in other countries as well. How it plays out varies from country to country. In Germany, for example, young women voted in very high numbers for Die Linke, the left-wing party there.\n\nA lot of different things could be causing this. But I think that if you look at non-political polling, you can really see evidence that there is wild, cultural change afoot here and basically everywhere else in the online world. In Norway, there\u2019s a poll of high school students where the fraction of young men saying, \u201cgender equality has gone too far\u201d spiked in recent years.\n\nI don\u2019t know necessarily what the answer to that is. But I think it\u2019s important to resist nihilism. These young men who have terrible, retrograde views on politics and gender relations are still pro-choice. They still support universal health care. I think we need our politicians to focus on those fights. But it\u2019s extremely important for other people \u2014 who don\u2019t need to win elections \u2014 to try to improve the online discourse around these more divisive issues.\n\nEarlier, you referenced the divide between cosmopolitan, college graduates who live in big cities and working-class voters. And you suggested that Democrats need to distance themselves from the sensibilities of highly educated urbanites. I\u2019m wondering if you could get more concrete. Do you think the party merely needs to increase the salience of its best issues by focusing on them rhetorically? Or are there areas where you believe Democrats need to become substantively more conservative?\n\nI think there are two very important things to understand about this election. The first thing is that the Biden administration was extremely unpopular. His approval ratings collapsed after Afghanistan and then continued to decline as prices went up and immigration happened. The budget fights in the fall of 2021 around the reconciliation package were particularly damaging. And then, his approval ratings never really recovered. And so, I think there\u2019s a substantive angle to that.\n\nThe way that we like to track issues is that we look at 40 different issues and we ask people basically, \u201cHow important are these issues?\u201d And then, \u201cWhat party do you trust more on these issues?\u201d\n\nIn 2020, what people cared about the most was Covid and health care. And those were also the issues that people trusted us on the most. And so the thing we had to do was very straightforward: We just had to talk about Covid and health care. That\u2019s what we did. And we won.\n\nBut the situation this time was a lot harder. The issue that voters cared the most about was overwhelmingly the cost of living. I really cannot stress how much people cared about the cost of living. If you ask what\u2019s more important, the cost of living or some other issue picked at random, people picked the cost of living 91 percent of the time. It\u2019s really hard to get 91 percent of people to click on anything in a survey.\n\nAfter the cost of living, it was the size and scope of the federal government, the budget deficit, immigration, crime, and also health care. And people trusted Republicans on these issues by double-digits \u2014 except for health care, where we had a 2-point advantage, which was much lower than our traditional advantage on that issue.\n\nI think there\u2019s this nihilism that\u2019s very popular in our industry \u2014 that nothing we do, or that the other side does, really matters. But in the wake of inflation, voters went from favoring Republicans by about 5 points on the economy to favoring them by 15 or 16. And after Dobbs, voters started trusting the Democrats much more on abortion. Education used to be the Democrats\u2019 strongest issue. But our standing on that collapsed during Covid, and now it\u2019s basically even. So, what people care about and trust us on really is responsive to concrete events that happen in the world. That isn\u2019t 100 percent of the story. There are a lot of other things going on. But what we do and what we say does matter.\n\nTo directly answer your original question \u2014 about how much of this is changing what our positions are versus messaging \u2014 I think the exact details of that vary from issue to issue. But I think that we have to approach this from the position that we are in a deep trust hole. The people that we\u2019re trying to persuade have very different values than we do and have a very different perception of reality. And a lot of these people are very poorly informed and literally do not consume the sources of information that we broadcast to.\n\nAnd so, there has to be some combination of messaging and outreach and changes in how we approach these platforms, and also probably some substantive changes that address what voters see as an error.\n\nIt seems to me that the Democratic Party\u2019s biggest challenge is less how to win the presidency than how to win comfortable Senate majorities. The median US state is much more conservative than America as a whole, and this means that the Senate is heavily biased against Democrats. In 2018 and 2020, Democrats won really strong national victories \u2014 and still ended up with just 50 Senate votes in 2021. So, how grim do you think the party\u2019s prospects of winning back the Senate are in the near term, and how can it go about improving those odds?\n\nI think we should start by recognizing how lucky we are. In 2020, we won basically every competitive Senate race. And in both 2022 and 2024, we saw something that I had never seen before, which is that we did a lot better in swing Senate races than we did nationally.\n\nBut a lot of that was the other side running terrible candidates. And we can\u2019t count on that happening forever. And even despite that \u2014 even despite historically well-run campaigns and historically weak opposition \u2014 here we are four years later at 47 Senate seats and with a very difficult path to getting back to 50 even in a wave Democratic year.\n\nAnd I think that something has to change in order for us to have a majority that\u2019s capable of securing the Senate. But I don\u2019t want to overemphasize the ideological dimension of that. What we really need to do to win in places like Ohio and Iowa is change the brand.\n\nThe candidate who outperformed the most in 2024 at the top of the ticket was Dan Osborn in Nebraska. And some of that was just because he ran as an independent. But a lot of it was that he ran an economically populist campaign that focused on issues that people cared about. I think that the moderate and left-wings of the party don\u2019t like each other very much, but they did both like Dan Osborn.\n\nTo push back a little on that, Osborn definitely ran a populist campaign. But he also aired advertisements declaring himself \u201cthe only real conservative\u201d in the race, attacked his Republican opponent for voting to fund the government, said that he would personally help build Trump\u2019s border wall, and didn\u2019t endorse Kamala Harris.\n\nAnd so, I feel like there definitely was an element of ideological moderation \u2014 or at least, heterodoxy \u2014 to his approach. More critically, Osborn refused to say which party he would caucus with once he got to the Senate. And yet, assuming he secretly did intend to caucus with the Democrats, that\u2019s a play you can only run a single time. After that first run, voters know which party you really favor. And it doesn\u2019t seem tenable for Democratic Senate candidates writ large to all pretend that they support Trump or might actually caucus with Republicans. So it\u2019s not clear to me how the Osborn model scales.\n\nI think the main problem is that we tried this strategy in an incredibly red state. I think Trump won Nebraska statewide by 20.5 points. But there are a bunch of states he won by between 4 and 7 points. The degree of ideological compromise that is necessary to win in a state like Ohio is very different than the degree of ideological compromise that\u2019s necessary to win in a state like Nebraska. And the current status quo is that we have a very low chance of winning in these places at all using the current strategy. But that said, I think that both wings of the party have to make sacrifices in order for us to achieve the coalition that we want.\n\nThere\u2019s an interesting tension in your polling: Voters generally say that they would like the Democratic Party to be more moderate, while also saying they favor \u201cmajor change\u201d and a \u201cshock to the system\u201d because things in America are going poorly. I think many people would look at that and see a contradiction. After all, moderate Democrats generally have less enthusiasm for major policy change \u2014 and feel more comfortable with the status quo \u2014 than progressive Democrats do.\n\nIt\u2019s tricky. On the one hand, voters say they thought that the Democratic candidate was too liberal. But on the other hand, in our randomized control trials, the best testing advertisements were more compatible with progressive critiques of the Harris campaign. The single best testing ad by the Kamala Harris campaign was one where she looked directly into the camera and said something like, \u201cI know the cost of living is too high, and I\u2019m going to fix that by building more housing and taking on landlords who are charging too much.\u201d\n\nAnd I think you can get into existential debates about what economic populism really is. But I think that the existing research really pointed clearly toward the idea that the electorate wanted economic change \u2014 and cared more about that than preserving America\u2019s institutions.\n\nWhatever you want to say about Trump, he has delivered a \u201cshock to the system\u201d \u2014 though maybe not the one that voters were hoping for. In your polling, has there been a reduction in support for the president since he took office? If so, where do you see him as being most vulnerable?\n\nYeah. Trump\u2019s approval rating has dropped since he took office. His ratings on his handling of the economy, which historically was a strong suit for him, have dropped the most, and his handling of cost of living has also gone down by quite a bit. And Elon Musk has become much more unpopular and is now the most unpopular member of his administration by a good deal. Trump and Elon have really spent the first part of their term diving into the biggest weaknesses of the Republican Party \u2014 namely, they\u2019re trying to pass tax cuts for billionaires, they\u2019re cutting essential services and causing chaos for regular people left and right, while trying to slash social safety net programs. It\u2019s Paul Ryan-ism on steroids.\n\nI think we have a real opportunity to return to the politics of 2012, in terms of vigorously opposing these very unpopular economic changes that Trump is pushing through.\n\nThe presentation that you\u2019ve been giving to Democratic stakeholders takes a sharp turn at the very end. You warn that the party cannot get stuck fighting the last war, and argue that 1) AI is going to cause mass unemployment in the relatively near future, 2) this social and political shock is likely to exacerbate partisan tensions in the US, and 3) Democrats need to start preparing for this scenario. Can you explain your reasoning?\n\nI\u2019m not an AI expert by any means, but AI capabilities are increasing dramatically. And AI experts are very, very bullish on the extent to which AI systems are going to be able to replace some fraction of jobs. The prediction markets say this, too. And I think something that\u2019s really important is that regardless of whether it\u2019s going to happen or not, the public believes it will happen.\n\nIf you just ask, \u201cDo you believe that AI will be able to perform most people\u2019s jobs better than humans can in the next 10 years?\u201d 65 percent of the population says yes and 35 percent says no.\n\nAnd then, when you ask, \u201cDo you think this will be good or bad?\u201d Something like 80 percent of the population believes that this is going to be bad. And so, I think this is something where voters are ahead of the political classes of both parties right now.\n\nI think when you try to speculate about something like this, it\u2019s important to recognize that nothing like this has ever really happened before, so it\u2019s hard to make predictions. But we worked with two economists, Jonathan Hersh and Daniel Rock, who have made fine-grained estimates of which jobs are going to be the most affected by AI and which the least. And their work indicates that this will impact college-educated people more than working-class people for the simple reason that LLMs are advancing more quickly than robotics is. And AI will also have a bigger impact on employment in cities and suburbs than in rural areas. And it will impact women more than men.\n\nAnd I really worry that this may accelerate these cultural divides that politics have been centered on in the last decade, in a way that could be unproductive and dark. In a lot of ways, this could be the biggest culture war fight of the century. And I don\u2019t pretend that I have the answer on what we should do. But with Covid, we had this sudden shock and our response just reinforced the dysfunctional cultural divides that had already opened up in 2016. And those effects have persisted and made it harder for us to win elections today. But unlike with Covid, we have a real chance of seeing this next shock a year or two ahead of time. And we really have to think about this proactively and not just dig our heads into the sand.\n\nCorrection, March 18, 12pm: Trump won Nebraska statewide by about 20.5 points.

        "full_text": "On a random Tuesday in February, a conservative provocateur and talk radio host made a bold proclamation about the state of the Democratic Party. Donald Trump had won over young men, and nearly a majority of young voters overall in November, because \u201cDemocrats, for men, are pussies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are no masculine men in the Democrat Party right now,\u201d Clay Travis, the Trump-supporting sports and politics commentator, said while speaking on a panel hosted at the University of Chicago. \u201cWho\u2019s the most masculine Democrat right now in America? Mayor Pete?\u201d\n\nHis audience gasped in response. The moderator intervened. And so began a week of debate and commentary about the relationship \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 between the Trump-era Democratic Party and the Gen Z men who abandoned them last year.\n\nIn hindsight, all the signs were there that the 2024 election would feature a yawning gender gap between Trump-curious men, and more liberal women. What polls predicted came true: a shift of Gen Z voters toward Republicans, driven by young men voting for Trump. Since then, plenty of postmortems have tried to wrestle with just what went wrong with the Democratic pitch. Still, the question remains: Will this dynamic linger? And if so, how worried should Democrats be?\n\nA month into the second Trump presidency, the alarm bells are still ringing. While the president\u2019s honeymoon is fading, he remains quite popular with the youngest cohort of men.\n\nAs Democrats attempt to redefine themselves ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections, they\u2019ll need to accurately diagnose why young men have jumped ship in large numbers.\n\nIn reviewing the data and talking to experts, three main explanations emerge.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s the structural: the effects and aftermath of the Covid pandemic and economic pressures that explain the shift of young men to the right.\n\nThen, there are Trump-specific dynamics, related to his persona, his campaign and media strategy last year, and his ability to define himself independently of the two-party, liberal-conservative spectrum.\n\nAnd finally, there are cultural, education, and gender dynamics that explain the divide \u2014 which Democrats have driven, and can still fix.\n\nBut if Democrats are to make any progress, their first step must be rooting out denial: When it comes to young men, the party has a real problem.\n\nWhat the Democrats\u2019 young male problem looks like\n\nThe Gen Z gender gap isn\u2019t easy to map out, so it\u2019s helpful to look at a few factors \u2014 vote choice, political ideology, partisan identification, and favorability ratings \u2014 to try to figure out what\u2019s going on.\n\nThe first, vote choice, is the easiest, but also bluntest, tool to use. Using estimates from VoteCast surveys, in 2024, young men backed Trump by a 14-point margin; young women backed Harris by a 17-point margin. Trump\u2019s share of the young male vote increased from 41 percent in 2020 to 56 percent in 2024 per VoteCast data by CIRCLE at Tufts University. And it\u2019s young white and Latino men who shifted most dramatically to the right, by 22 points and 38 points respectively.\n\nPartisan identification shows some of this change too. Over the last 20 years, it\u2019s young men who have been more likely to identify as Republicans, according to Gallup polling data. The share of young women, aged 18-29, who identify as or lean toward Democrats has remained steady since about 2003, while the share of young men who identify with Republicans has steadily grown since 2015.\n\nPuzzlingly, the change in partisan leaning has not been accompanied by a corresponding self-reported change in young men\u2019s political ideology. They have not been calling themselves more \u201cconservative\u201d over that same timeline. Instead, it\u2019s young women who have gotten much more liberal over the last two decades, while the share of men who call themselves conservative has remained steady. According to Gallup polling, women 18 to 29 who call themselves liberal are now at the highest level they\u2019ve been since 1999, a trend that picked up during the second Obama term and the first Trump presidency. A plurality of young men, meanwhile, have called themselves moderate over the last 20 years, with shares of young conservatives and young liberals also remaining steady.\n\nWhat this all suggests is two opposite shifts: Young women are identifying as more liberal, but not necessarily more Democratic. Young men, meanwhile, are identifying as more Republican, but not more conservative. It\u2019s a point that Daniel Cox, the director of the American Enterprise Institute\u2019s Survey Center on American Life, was trying to make on the same panel that Travis blew up at the University of Chicago. His argument is that issues, and the positions the political parties are taking, only explain so much.\n\nYoung women are identifying as more liberal, but not necessarily more Democratic. Young men, meanwhile, are identifying as more Republican, but not more conservative.\n\n\u201cYou have a slow decline. This didn\u2019t happen in just one election. There\u2019s been a deterioration of Democratic identity among young men for over 10 years,\u201d Cox said. \u201cThis group looks a lot more liberal on paper. You had six in 10 young men who are moderates vote for Trump, and more than one in five liberal young men vote for Trump\u2026There\u2019s something about Trump that was attractive and then there\u2019s something about the Democratic Party, at least in its current manifestation, that was repellent.\u201d\n\nExplanation No. 1: It\u2019s bigger than America\n\nThere is no one explanation for these dynamics, but breaking out a few theories can help explain the situation.\n\nWe can start with structural, post-Covid explanations. The shift of young people to the right in general isn\u2019t only happening in the United States, but all over the world. Something about this generation\u2019s experiences, regardless of gender, is causing a rightward shift.\n\nThat shift mirrors the anti-establishment, anti-incumbency trend that democracies have been experiencing since the start of the coronavirus pandemic: frustration with the economic prospects; the squeeze of inflation and prices, and distrust in institutions, which in the US were represented by the Democratic Party. This theory would explain the dramatic shift in vote choices and partisan representation of young men over the last decade, and it is boosted by the fact that both young men and young women swung to Republicans last year \u2014 despite those swings being uneven.\n\nOutside of the US, it\u2019s young voters who drove some of the surges of far-right and right-wing political parties across Europe in 2024. As the Atlantic\u2019s Derek Thompson put it recently:\n\nIn France, Germany, Finland, and beyond, young voters are swinging their support toward anti-establishment far-right parties \u201cin numbers equal to and even exceeding older voters.\u201d In Germany, a 2024 survey of 2,000 people showed that young people have adopted a relatively new \u201cgloomy outlook\u201d on the future. No surprise, then, that the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland has become the most popular party among Germans under 30. Like most interesting phenomena, this one even has a German name: Rechtsruck, or rightward shift.\n\nThompson points to political science research that has tracked a negative effect on trust in scientific authorities and political leaders as a result of pandemics and epidemics, particularly with those people between the ages of 18 and 25. Declining trust in American institutions \u2014 such as the Supreme Court, news media, the presidency, Congress, and big business \u2014 all make sense under this view.\n\nThe economics writer Kyla Scanlon argues something similar: that the youngest cohort of Gen Z faces a world of AI-driven disruption and institutional distrust and instability. They\u2019re surrounded by echo chambers that feed their anxiety, and feel looser social connections. In response, they\u2019re embracing more extreme, polarized identities and approaches to the economy and politics.\n\n\u201cMany younger Gen Zers came of age watching political gridlock, rising inequality, and a system that seemed increasingly detached from their lived reality. They saw institutions that refused to adapt (and as of recently, have shown a lack of resilience). They were locked inside during their formative years,\u201d she argues, and so view reality much differently than even the older range of Gen Z.\n\nIn the context of the 2024 election, this theory explains why young Democrats in particular were so down on Joe Biden, and eventually distrustful of Harris and the establishment she came to represent. My own conversations with youth Democratic activists during the election cycle and in its aftermath brought forth many of the same takeaways \u2014 that young Democrats found themselves talking to young people who were distrustful of the status quo, of incumbents, and of an older generation of politicians promising change.\n\nBut while these explanations do a solid job explaining the overall shift of Gen Z, they\u2019re less strong on explaining the dramatic lurch right by young men specifically.\n\nExplanation No. 2: There\u2019s something unique about Trump\n\nWhether it was the issues Trump talked about, the salience of those issues to young people, or his campaign strategy and appeal to traditional masculinity, these candidate-specific factors are more persuasive in explaining how a group that reads more liberal on paper could be willing to swing so drastically to the right.\n\nAs Cox of AEI told me, \u201cThey\u2019re Trump Republicans, they\u2019re not [traditional] Republicans.\u201d They hold much more progressive views on a range of issues, and are much less aligned with the traditional Republican orthodoxy than standard conservatives, but were Trump-curious, or felt less stigma in being open to voting for him.\n\nMuch of that was due to the media and messaging apparatus Trump and his allies built over the last year, specifically to reach young men. Whether through specific advertising, social media and influencer outreach on YouTube and TikTok, podcast interviews, or other campaign events, Trump saturated the feeds and platforms that young people, especially men, love to consume.\n\nIt worked. Trump posted his strongest gains with groups of young voters who fall into two buckets: those who prioritized the economy and \u201clow-propensity\u201d voters. That second",

        "full_text": "In the past week, Donald Trump announced that he would buy a Tesla and advertised the company\u2019s vehicles at an event that turned the White House lawn into a showroom benefitting his ally, Tesla CEO Elon Musk. He also said that vandalizing Tesla cars \u2014 as some demonstrators have done to protest Musk \u2014 will be labeled an act of \u201cdomestic terrorism.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the latest and perhaps most egregious example of the conflicts of interest that have ensnared both Trump and Musk, who is leading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a role that has given the world\u2019s richest man the ability to target and gut any government agency that draws his ire.\n\nThis isn\u2019t anything new. Trump\u2019s first term was riddled with unprecedented conflicts of interest. Yet this time around, Trump came into office with even more business entanglements and ways to use the presidency to enrich himself. His social media company, Truth Social, is now a publicly traded company, giving anyone the ability to become a shareholder in the president\u2019s business. He and his family members have launched crypto coins. And Trump also has a new set of merchandise licensing deals.\n\nBut when it comes to just how unprecedented the conflicts of interest are in this administration, the Tesla incident shows that Musk is the new elephant in the room. The businessman, who became one of the president\u2019s closest advisers after spending hundreds of millions of dollars to help Trump win, is now directly influencing agencies tasked with regulating his own companies. And of course other Trump appointees and nominees \u2014 from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to Dr. Mehmet Oz, Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \u2014 are not free from conflicts of interest either.\n\nAt this point, the public seems resigned to the fact that people in power also have massive incentives to enrich themselves. But in truth, there are people and processes that are supposed to protect us from this kind of abuse. What are they, how have they broken down, and how can we get them to work?\n\nHow the government polices itself\n\nA conflict of interest arises when an official\u2019s personal interests can cloud their judgement when making decisions on behalf of the public. When foreign officials, for example, spend money at Trump\u2019s businesses, they create a conflict of interest for the president because he materially benefits from his relationship with them. And while some conflicts of interest are inevitable and not inherently corrupt, they do increase the risk of corruption, where officials intentionally advance their own personal interests instead of national ones.\n\nEvery branch of government has ethics standards and conflict of interest rules. Though as the ethics scandals with Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas have shown, they\u2019re not always enforced.\n\nIn the executive branch, conflicts of interest are determined by statutes that apply to all federal employees \u2014 like the law prohibiting someone from working on matters where they have a financial interest \u2014 and ethics rules that are set up by the White House.\n\nOne major limitation, though, is that these conflict of interest laws do not apply to the president or vice president, which is why Trump is allowed to maintain all of his businesses while serving in the White House.\n\nAs for Musk, there\u2019s a reason he hasn\u2019t been subject to the same ethics standards as most other government employees. \u201cThe administration has taken pretty significant steps to insulate Mr. Musk from accountability,\u201d said Donald Sherman, the executive director and chief counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). \u201cSo they made him a special government employee instead of a permanent employee, so he\u2019s working for the federal government while also maintaining his day job.\u201d\n\nThe administration has pointed to that special status \u2014 usually given to short-term advisers who sit on temporary advisory committees or task forces \u2014 as a reason why Musk doesn\u2019t have to make his financial disclosure form public, limiting scrutiny into his businesses\u2019 entanglements. (Past administrations have also dubiously granted people special government employee status, as was the case when Huma Abedin worked as an aide to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton while maintaining an outside consulting job.)\n\nSo who is responsible for actually enforcing existing conflict of interest rules where they can be applied?\n\n\u201cPrimarily that has been \u2014 within the executive branch \u2014 the Office of Government Ethics,\u201d said Eric Petry, who serves as counsel in the Brennan Center\u2019s Elections and Government Program. \u201cThere\u2019s also a robust system of inspectors general, who are supposed to expose fraud and waste and conflicts.\u201d\n\nThe Office of Government Ethics (OGE) was formed after the Watergate scandal. Before then, conflict of interest cases were mostly handled through criminal investigations and proceedings, but OGE was established to help prevent conflicts of interest from arising in the first place. Tasked with scrutinizing the president\u2019s political appointees, the office reviews their financial disclosures, identifies areas where conflicts of interest might arise, and proposes ethics agreements to address those conflicts, including by requiring appointees to sell assets. OGE also maintains a database of officials\u2019 disclosures, which are generally available to the public.\n\nInspectors general also play an important role. They are an independent watchdog within a given agency and conduct audits and investigations to ensure that the agency and its employees are complying with the law and to prevent fraud and abuse. While their investigations usually come in the form of a public report, inspectors general can also make referrals to the Department of Justice, where criminal violations can be prosecuted.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d as Petry notes, \u201cyou\u2019ve seen the Trump administration has really been putting those systems under stress or just outright ignoring them.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Trump has engaged in a full-on assault on these watchdogs, firing the director of OGE as well as at least 17 inspectors general across various federal agencies. Trump\u2019s moves also underscore the potential conflicts of interest at play. At least one of the inspectors general he fired was overseeing an investigation into one of Musk\u2019s companies. To put it mildly, these firings \u2014 which are potentially unlawful \u2014 are a major setback for the executive branch\u2019s ability to police itself.\n\nObviously, that\u2019s by design. From day one, Trump has shown little interest in promoting ethical conduct. One of his first executive orders, for example, rescinded Biden-era ethics rules that prohibited employees from accepting gifts from lobbyists. To be sure, while other administrations haven\u2019t exactly been squeaky clean, the way the Trump administration has handled ethics concerns is a departure from its predecessors.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately within the executive branch, some of the tools that we typically look to to police conflicts are not going to be effective,\u201d Petry said. \u201cSo that means we look to the other branches of government.\u201d\n\nCongress and the courts need to step up\n\nThis administration\u2019s flagrant disregard for ethics rules underscores that the regulations we already have are clearly not enough. \u201cIt\u2019s a real problem that federal conflicts-of-interest laws don\u2019t apply to the president and vice president,\u201d Petry said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that Congress can and should change. There are problems here that are sort of systemic that require reform.\u201d After Trump left office in 2021, there were some efforts to bolster ethics standards and oversight, and ensure that the president and vice president are no longer exempt from conflict of interest rules. But those efforts largely failed.\n\nStill, the different branches of government have to make an active effort to hold each other accountable. Since Trump has undermined the ability of the executive branch to hold itself accountable, the Congress and the courts have to be more vigilant.\n\nIt might seem like it\u2019s expecting too much of a Republican-controlled Congress to investigate potential conflicts of interests, but that\u2019s the legislative branch\u2019s job. It\u2019s also not unheard of. During Trump\u2019s first term, Republican lawmakers oversaw inquiries into the president\u2019s appointees. Former US Rep. Jason Chaffetz, of Utah, for example, called out Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, for potentially violating the law for not properly disclosing payments from foreign governments. (Flynn pleaded guilty for lying to law enforcement, but the Department of Justice eventually dropped its case against him and Trump granted him a pardon in 2020.)\n\nWhere Congress falls short, the courts can step in. Trump\u2019s firing of the inspectors general, for example, is improper because he neither gave Congress a 30-day notice, as required by law, nor provided a substantive reason for the inspectors general dismissals. So some of those inspectors general have filed a lawsuit against Trump, saying their firing was \u201ccontrary to the rule of law.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately this moment of chaos could be really painful for a lot of people, but hopefully it will generate the backlash and public momentum for changing the system that we saw following the Gilded Age, following Watergate, following other periods of crisis and constitutional uncertainty,\u201d Petry said.\n\nThat\u2019s why the last line of defense against the conflicts of interest plaguing the Trump administration is important. And that is the role of the press and government watchdog groups.\n\nTrump has been able to evade accountability in part because he is more immune to public shaming than other public officials. His corruption has always been brazen and often out in the open. As a result, many people seem desensitized to this kind of abuse of presidential power.\n\nBut while public shaming might not work as effectively on Trump, it can pressure other officials and institutions to take action. Even when there aren\u2019t specific remedies to Trump\u2019s or Musk\u2019s conflicts of interest, shedding light on them for the public to see is an important accountability mechanism because people can demand more of their representatives in government and put pressure on the administration. So the public shouldn\u2019t be resigned to the idea that ethics rules are somehow moot under Trump.\n\nAfter all, that\u2019s who lawmakers will have to answer to come election time. And it\u2019s likely that voters will have some questions about who this administration is really serving.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be an ethics expert,\u201d Sherman, of CREW, said, \u201cto have significant questions about how this administration is operating and whether or not conduct rises to the level of a violation of federal or criminal law.\u201d",

        "full_text": "Donald Trump has a gift for inheriting valuable things. And the economy of January 2025 was no exception.\n\nWhen the president took office, stock values were hitting record highs, unemployment was hovering near historic lows, and consumer confidence was stable. Wall Street expected that business conditions would only improve. Among investors, conventional wisdom held that Trump was serious about corporate tax cuts \u2014 but not about launching an unprovoked trade war against America\u2019s closest allies (a proposition too pointless and self-destructive to be sincere).\n\nTimes have changed. Contrary to corporate America\u2019s wishful thinking, Trump has made good on his promise for large tariffs on Chinese goods, steel and aluminum from all countries, and many Mexican and Canadian imports, triggering retaliatory tariffs from America\u2019s trade partners. Largely as a result of these developments, US stock markets forfeited six months of gains in three weeks, while consumer confidence fell precipitously. All this has led countless Americans to ask whether their economy is headed for a recession (Google searches for that word have skyrocketed since the beginning of March).\n\nThere is no certain answer to that question. Economic forecasters generally believe that the risk of a US downturn in 2025 has risen sharply over the past month, but still remains unlikely. What\u2019s left of Wall Street\u2019s optimism rests on a simple truth: Trump (almost certainly) has the power to stabilize the economy whenever he pleases by merely abandoning his most arbitrary and haphazard trade policies. But betting on the president\u2019s prudence seems only a little safer than investing in his memecoin.\n\nWhy Wall Street is increasingly worried about the risk of a recession\n\nThe probability of a US recession has risen in recent weeks, according to major US banks. JPMorgan Chase now pegs the risk of a 2025 economic downturn at 40 percent, up from 30 percent at the start of the year. Goldman Sachs raised its own recession probability from 15 percent to 20 percent last week.\n\nEven if the US does not enter a proper recession \u2014 which is defined as six months of declining economic activity \u2014 the outlook for economic growth has soured, according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve, Morgan Stanley, and other analysts.\n\nTrump\u2019s trade policies are the primary cause of such darkening forecasts.\n\nLarge and perpetually shifting tariffs hurt the economy in multiple ways. Tariffs are a tax on foreign-made goods paid by importers \u2014 such as retailers or manufacturers \u2014 who tend to pass their heightened costs onto consumers. This effectively reduces Americans\u2019 purchasing power. According to one estimate from the Peterson Institute, if Trump\u2019s tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada were to be fully implemented, and left in place, they would cost the typical US household $1,200 a year.\n\nWhen Americans make less money, they tend to reduce their spending on goods and services. And when consumer demand declines, businesses often lay off workers, who must then reduce their own spending \u2014 a dynamic that can yield a self-reinforcing, recessionary cycle.\n\nTrump has mitigated his tariffs\u2019 impact on consumers by repeatedly pausing them, or adding temporary exemptions for certain goods. Yet the fact that the president\u2019s trade policy is constantly changing creates its own problems.\n\nEconomic uncertainty is bad for investment. As harmful as Trump\u2019s tariffs are, if businesses knew they would be permanent, then some might invest in new US factories or mines that wouldn\u2019t have been financially viable under conditions of free trade. By contrast, if no one can be sure that Trump won\u2019t roll back those tariffs tomorrow then investing in such factories would be perilous. Uncertainty therefore leads many investors and companies to delay investment until long-term economic conditions become clear. And a pullback in investment reduces demand in the economy, thereby increasing the risk of recession.\n\nThese factors lay the groundwork for a stock market selloff. But that sell-off was accelerated by the president\u2019s nonchalant attitude toward falling equity values. For months, financial analysts had assumed that the stock market boasted a veto over Trump\u2019s most ill-advised economic policies: Given the president\u2019s past enthusiasm for bragging about record stock prices, many believed that Trump would roll back his tariffs in response to any sustained drop.\n\nBut over the past week, the president and his advisers have signaled the opposite: That they are comfortable with inducing economic pain in the immediate term, for the sake of realizing their broader ideological goals. Asked about whether he expected a recession this year, Trump told last Sunday that he didn\u2019t like to \u201cpredict things like that\u201d but \u201cthere is a period of transition because what we\u2019re doing is very big. \u2026 And there are always periods of, it takes a little time.\u201d\n\nAlthough Trump has been the primary driver of declining investor sentiment, he is not the sole cause of economic concern. The economy of January 2025 was broadly considered strong. But it had some vulnerabilities. Years of inflation had eroded Americans\u2019 savings, causing some to fall behind on their loans. \n\nThe Trump-induced stock market collapse risks exacerbating these sources of economic strain, since affluent households often pare back spending when the value of their stock portfolios declines.\n\nThe risk of a downturn is rising, but the odds are still low\n\nAll this said, there\u2019s reason to think fears of an imminent recession have been overhyped. One source of such anxieties is the Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDP forecast, which turned negative in recent weeks. But the Fed\u2019s model is highly volatile, and its current projections are largely informed by data from early this year, particularly a 0.2 percent decline in consumer spending during January.\n\nBut there\u2019s reason to think that this dip reflected fleeting headwinds. After all, much of the country experienced major winter storms in January, while southern California was devastated by wildfires. These natural disasters surely kept many Americans away from retailers, restaurants, and other businesses.\n\nIt is true that consumer sentiment has fallen precipitously in recent months, in response to the public\u2019s anxieties over Trump\u2019s tariffs. But such surveys have not been very predictive of consumers\u2019 actual spending habits in recent years.\n\nMeanwhile, the US economy continued adding jobs in February and unemployment remains low by historical standards. One of the government\u2019s gauges of inflation also came in unexpectedly low Wednesday, showing that consumer prices were only 2.8 percent higher in February 2025 than they were one year earlier. If inflation continues to decline, then the Federal Reserve may feel comfortable cutting interest rates, which would make it easier for consumers to spend and businesses to invest.\n\nTrump could stabilize the economy if he wanted to\n\nWhile the US economy isn\u2019t devoid of complicated challenges, Trump could all but eliminate the threat of a recession anytime he wishes. All he needs to do is rescind his unpopular and arbitrary tariffs.\n\nDoing so would not undermine any of the president\u2019s more respectable economic goals. Putting 25 percent tariffs on industrial inputs made in Canada and Mexico is not beneficial for American manufacturing, but harmful to it. And alienating core US allies does not bolster our nation\u2019s national security but jeopardizes it.\n\nGoldman Sachs\u2019s belief that the risk of a recession is only 20 percent hinges on Trump\u2019s responsiveness to deteriorating economic conditions: The fact that \u201cthe White House has the option to pull back if the downside risks begin to look more serious\u201d tempers the bank\u2019s anxiety.\n\nPerhaps, if stocks remain depressed \u2014 while unemployment climbs \u2014 the president will decide to prioritize Americans\u2019 economic well-being over his own ideological hobby horses. But I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019d put money on it. And a growing number of investors seem to feel the same.",

        "full_text": "In early February, Texas health officials reported that measles was spreading among an insular religious community in Gaines County, Texas, where nearly 14 percent of schoolchildren have an exemption (granted in some states for reasons of conscience, including for religious beliefs) from the required childhood vaccinations. The disease has since been detected in a bordering New Mexico county. And this week, the case count grew to at least 124 people. Last year, the US saw 285 measles cases nationwide \u2014 the fourth-highest total since 2000.\n\nThe outbreak has escalated just as the US\u2019s foremost vaccine skeptic, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has ascended as its top health care official. On February 26, the Texas health department reported the first death in the outbreak, an unvaccinated school-aged child.\n\nKennedy promises to probe the safety of childhood vaccines, and in his first actions as the new US Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary, Kennedy has already put vaccine advisory meetings on indefinite hold. He has helped cultivate a culture of skepticism toward medical science as the most prominent voice promoting a debunked link between childhood vaccinations and autism and other health issues \u2014 a view that corresponds to the re-emergence of measles over the past decade.\n\nKennedy is no longer an outside agitator but the government official ultimately responsible for squashing public health threats in the US.\n\nSo far, he has not commented on the Texas outbreak. But what happens next will be the first big test case for how Kennedy will lead the US health department during an active public health emergency.\n\nHow would the response to an outbreak normally look?\n\nWhen there is a disease outbreak that requires government action (i.e., not your standard sniffles), local governments are the first responders. County officials are typically the first to receive reports of a disease spreading and they will start ramping up testing and other kinds of surveillance to assess the situation.\n\nThat was what happened in Texas: One Gaines County school district reported the first measles to their local community in late January. Within a week, the Texas state government stepped up once the outbreak had climbed to six cases, and began providing support for the local response. That\u2019s also typical: While local authorities are on the front line, the state provides technical expertise, they may offer funding for communication and interventions (such as vaccine drive-throughs), and they otherwise serve as the top authority on how the response should be handled.\n\nThe feds usually stay in the background with an outbreak the size of the current measles occurrence. They can offer expert or laboratory support, for example. But otherwise, they are supporting players, unless the outbreak poses a unique threat to the rest of the nation or becomes a large multi-state crisis. For now, the current outbreak is limited to a small geographical region, and the states appear well aligned on how to respond.\n\nBut it is possible that further spread could demand federal officials get more involved \u2014 a development that would be worth watching closely, given its new leadership.\n\nThe good news: So far, RFK Jr.\u2019s HHS isn\u2019t complicating the response.\n\nThe outbreak was already underway before Kennedy was confirmed and, though it\u2019s easy to forget after the pandemic, local authorities are taking the lead as they should. Texas health officials \u2014 and their counterparts in New Mexico, now that cases have begun to spread there \u2014 have set up mobile vaccination and testing sites, encouraging unvaccinated people to get their shots now. Because local officials are among the community they serve, they may be considered more trustworthy (and in turn they can ultimately be more effective).\n\nIf those efforts are allowed to continue unencumbered, that will be a hopeful sign that the RFK Jr.-led health department will not actively sabotage public health efforts when there is an acute crisis underway. After some observers pointed out that the CDC measles tracker had not been with the new outbreak, the web page was refreshed on Friday with a pledge to continue updating it every Friday.\n\nSo far, there is no sign that local officials have requested support from the federal government and been denied it.\n\nShould I be worried about measles spreading more widely?\n\nNot exactly. Such outbreaks are still relatively rare and, when they do occur, they usually stay localized. But America is trending in the wrong direction when it comes to this ancient disease, which can cause painful skin rashes and be deadly for young unvaccinated children.\n\nThe US declared measles eliminated in 2000. But it has regained a foothold as vaccination rates have dropped. In 2019, there was the largest outbreak in decades when more than 1,200 people became ill, mostly in New York. Now more than 120 individuals are sick along the border of Texas and New Mexico \u2014 larger than any outbreak last year and it is still only February.\n\nNationally, the measles vaccination rate has slipped just below the 95 percent target that experts say is necessary to maintain population-level immunity. In some states, the situation is more dire: 14 states had vaccination rates below 90 percent for the 2023\u20132024 school year, per the health policy think tank KFF.\n\nBut in individual communities, rates can slip even lower, creating the right conditions for an outbreak to explode; measles, after all, is one of the most contagious diseases known to man. In the Gaines County school district most affected by the outbreak, the vaccination rate is under 50 percent.\n\nThe vast majority of Americans still believe the measles vaccine is safe and effective, and its benefits outweigh any risks. But as our collective faith in science deteriorates, vaccination rates are also declining.\n\nUpdate, February 26, 11:20 am ET: This story has been updated to include the first death of a child who contracted measles in the Texas outbreak.",

The answer is simple, making it easier to pay the fare and making it more affordable means more for paying customers,\u201d Lieber said Wednesday.\n\n\u201cContactless fare payment is not only faster and more convenient, it\u2019s going to allow us to do more, much more with discounts and promotions. It\u2019s a much more dynamic system.\u201d\n\nMetroCards have reigned supreme in the Big Apple since its introduction in 1993. The OMNY of its time, the originally blue cards replaced subway tokens, which were only sold in packs of ten, and introduced the city to the world of free transfers.\n\nMuch like the OMNY rollout, it also took years for MetroCards to be introduced. Carol Bellamy, the first woman elected to the City Council, floated the idea back in the 1970s, but the MTA didn\u2019t seriously contemplate it until 1983.\n\nThe Whitehall Station was the first to get the automatic fare collection (AFC) turnstiles in 1994 \u2014 and sold 600 MetroCards on its first day, New York Transit Museum Curator Jodi Shapiro told The Post.\n\nIt would be another three years before the rest of the city\u2019s stations and all the buses in the MTA\u2019s flee had their own AFC turnstiles, an undertaking that cost almost $700 million at the time, and was one of the biggest projects in the subway\u2019s then-90 year history.\n\nThe MetroCard vending machines were unveiled in 1999, over 2,250 of which are in subways today \u2014 but it wouldn\u2019t be until 2003 that token sales finally ceased.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be honest. New Yorkers hate change. When the MetroCard debuted, plenty of die-hard token users struggled with the idea. But after a few years, public perception shifted, and I think the convenience of the cards was really appreciated,\u201d said Shapiro.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the New York way \u2014 resist, complain, learn the benefits, and adapt. Not exactly the Kubler-Ross model, but close.\u201d\n\nDespite the initial resistance, the plastic passes quickly became much more than a method of transit and was quickly usurped into the identity and iconography of New York City.\n\nT-shirts, coffee mugs, pins and even Christmas tree ornaments emboldened with the distinguishable Helvetica font can be found throughout the five boroughs \u2014 and local artists have routinely turned toward the disposable cards as a form of media to craft their pieces over the last three decades.\n\nThe cards themselves have also served as canvases through the MTA Arts & Design program, Lilly Tuttle, Curator at the Museum of the City of New York pointed out. One such piece includes the 7 million cards simply printed with the word \u201cOptimism\u201d in 2009 as part of a mission to inject joy into the transit hubs.\n\nWhile OMNY also signifies a leap toward the future, Tuttle acknowledged there will be a void when MetroCards become nothing more than a collector\u2019s item.\n\n\u201cI think there will be something lost,\u201d said the lifelong New Yorker, who keeps several subway tokens near the desk at the museum.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much nostalgia for the token and people remember the different token styles \u2026 At the MTA store, you can buy token earrings and token lapel pins and things like that. I can imagine that in the future the nostalgia for the MetroCard will only increase because it will feel sort of retro \u2014 that whole idea of bygone technology that people increasingly have a great, great affinity for.\u201d",

        "full_text": "President Trump has fired both of the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s Democratic members, setting up a legal battle that will have major implications for a key bipartisan regulatory agency traditionally seen as independent from the executive branch.\n\nThe White House informed Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter of their dismissals on Tuesday, the Democrats confirmed in separate X posts. Both Bedoya and Slaughter called their firings \u201cillegal\u201d and vowed to challenge Trump in court.\n\n\u201cThe president just illegally fired me. This is corruption plain and simple,\u201d said Bedoya.\n\nSlaughter said Trump\u2019s decision violated \u201cthe plain language of a statute and clear Supreme Court precedent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe law protects the independence of the Commission because the law serves the American people, not corporate power,\u201d Slaughter said in a statement.\n\nThe firings left FTC chair Andrew Ferguson and fellow Republican Melissa Holyoak as the sole remaining members of the five-person panel. Mark Meador, who was nominated by Trump to be the third Republican FTC commissioner, has yet to be confirmed by a full Senate vote.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear if Trump plans to nominate replacements for Bedoya and Slaughter.\n\nWhite House assistant press secretary Taylor Rogers said Trump \u201chas the lawful authority to manage personnel within the executive branch.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump will continue to rid the federal government of bad actors unaligned with his common sense agenda the American people decisively voted for,\u201d Rogers added in a statement.\n\nFerguson, who has referred to the agency as the \u201cTrump-Vance FTC\u201d since taking over as chair, backed the president\u2019s right to fire commissioners.\n\n\u201cI have no doubts about his constitutional authority to remove commissioners, which is necessary to ensure democratic accountability for our government,\u201d Ferguson said in a statement posted on X.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Trade Commission will continue its tireless work to protect consumers, lower prices, and police anticompetitive behavior,\u201d Ferguson added.\n\nA White House official informed Bedoya and Slaughter that the president has \u201cunrestricted power\u201d to remove executive-branch officers who were confirmed by the Senate, according to an email obtained by the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cYour continued service on the FTC is inconsistent with my administration\u2019s priorities,\u201d the email said. \u201cAccordingly, I am removing you from office pursuant to my authority under Article II of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Ferguson confirmed that the FTC was fully prepared to challenge Meta in an April trial that is seeking a breakup of the tech giant. The agency also has pending cases against Amazon and oversees data privacy settlements related to Meta and X.\n\nTrump has sought to exert greater control over independent agencies, issuing an executive order in February that gave the White House more latitude.\n\nThe firings will test a 1935 decision by the Supreme Court in the case Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. United States.\n\nAt the time, the court ruled that the president doesn\u2019t have the authority to fire FTC commissioners without good cause \u2014 setting a precedent that has traditionally shielded independent bodies like the FTC and the Federal Reserve from direct executive intervention.\n\nThe White House argues that the FTC has significant executive power and that exemptions offered by Humphrey\u2019s Executor should not apply to its commissioners.\n\nThe FTC firings have \u201cmajor implications for the independence of the Fed,\u201d one former FTC official told The Post.\n\nTrump has been sharply critical of Fed Chair Jerome Powell in the past due to disagreements over his handling of interest rates. Powell will notably announce the Fed\u2019s next policy move this afternoon.\n\n\u201cI think it was timed as a threat,\u201d the FTC official said.\n\nThe firings along partisan lines could backfire on Republicans in the future under a Democratic White House administration, the official added.\n\n\u201cAre we all going to be happy with Queen Lina Khan at the FTC?\u201d the official said.\n\nKhan, who led the agency under former President Joe Biden and irritated business leaders with a hardnosed approach to enforcement, also ripped the firings.\n\n\u201cThe must enforce the law without fear or favor,\u201d Khan said. \u201cThe administration\u2019s illegal attempt to fire Commissioners Slaughter & Bedoya is a disturbing sign that this FTC won\u2019t. It\u2019s a gift to corporate lawbreakers that squeeze American consumers, workers, and honest businesses.\u201d",

        "full_text": "George Foreman, heavyweight boxing icon and business entrepreneur, died on Friday night.\n\nHe was 76 years old.\n\nThe International Boxing Hall of Famer\u2019s family announced the news on his Instagram page.\n\n\u201cOur hearts are broken,\u201d the caption read on the post. \u201cWith profound sorrow, we announce the passing of our beloved George Edward Foreman Sr. who peacefully departed on March 21, 2025 surrounded by loved ones. A devout preacher, a devoted husband, a loving father, and a proud grand and great grandfather, he lived a life marked by unwavering faith, humility, and purpose.\u201d\n\nBorn in Marshall, Texas in 1949, Foreman, who admittedly was a bully in his youth, joined the Job Corps at 16 years old before turning to boxing at 17.\n\nHe made his first major stamp on the boxing world as a 19-year-old at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics when he won the heavyweight gold medal against Soviet fighter Jonas \u010cepulis.\n\nIn 2012, Foreman reminisced about the win and how \u201cafraid\u201d he was at the time of the fight after accumulating fewer than two dozen amateur fights before the Olympics.\n\n\u201cWhen I look back at the fight, all I can remember was how afraid I was,\u201d he told the . \u201cChepulis was representing another \u2018superpower\u2019. I didn\u2019t have the confidence that people thought I had.\n\n\u201cI wanted to win gold but didn\u2019t expect anything like that to happen in my life. But I was told to jab, jab, jab. With my jabs and other wild punches, there was no way to stop me. \u2026 The left jab was my number one punch \u2014 I still think it was the best punch in boxing.\u201d\n\nOne year after his gold medal win, the fearsome and intimidating Foreman took up professional boxing, embarking on a legendary career that saw him accumulate a 76-5 record with 68 wins by knockout.\n\nIn 1973, he won his first of two heavyweight champions when he knocked out Joe Frazier \u2014 the heavyweight gold medalist in 1964 \u2014 during a bout in Jamaica.\n\nForeman lost the title one year later in the famous \u201cRumble in the Jungle\u201d against Muhammad Ali in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo).\n\nIn 1977 after a defeat at the hands of Jimmy Young in a fight in Puerto Rico, Foreman suffered from exhaustion and heatstroke in what he called a near-death experience.\n\nHe stepped away from boxing for a decade and returned to Texas.\n\nHis life took a complete 180-degree turn as he became an ordained minister, and, in 1984, founded the George Foreman Youth and Community Center.\n\nForeman returned to the squared circle in 1987, and in 1994, found himself back on top in defeating Michael Moorer for his second heavyweight title at the age of 45 \u2014 two decades after losing his first to Ali.\n\n\u201cAnything you desire, you can make happen,\u201d Foreman said after that fight. \u201cIt\u2019s like the song, \u2018When you wish upon a star, your dreams come true.\u2019 Well, look at me tonight.\u201d\n\nIn 1997, he retired from boxing for good, having already reinvented himself as a gregarious pitchman endorsing various products, the most famous of which was the George Foreman Grill line, which earned him millions.\n\nForeman also made a number of television appearances in his life, including on a 1975 episode of \u201cThe Six Million Dollar Man\u201d and, most recently, on \u201cThe Masked Singer\u201d in 2022.\n\nHe had 12 children, and all five of his sons were named George.\n\n\u201cI named all my sons George Edward Foreman so they would always have something in common. I say to them, \u2018If one of us goes up, then we all go up together, and if one goes down, we all go down together,\u2019 \u201d Foreman wrote on his website.\n\nWith his life spanning across sports and pop culture, stars from across the spectrum were saddened by the legend\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cCondolences to George Foreman\u2019s family,\u201d Mike Tyson wrote on X after the news of Foreman\u2019s death broke. \u201cHis contribution to boxing and beyond will never be forgotten.\u201d\n\n\u201cRest in peace, George Foreman. Your legacy lives on, champ,\u201d NBA legend Scottie Pippen wrote.\n\n\u201cLegendary boxing champion, life-changing preacher, husband, father, grand- and great-grandfather and the best friend you could have,\u201d WBC President Mauricio Sulaiman wrote on his social media. \u201cHis memory is now eternal, may Big George rest in peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cCondolences to the family of George Foreman,\u201d wrote actor William Shatner.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful for the outpouring of love and prayers, and kindly ask for privacy as we honor the extraordinary life of a man we were blessed to call our own,\u201d Foreman\u2019s family wrote in their statement.",

        "full_text": "About a dozen people were cuffed as they clashed with NYPD officers during a demonstration in support of former Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil on Tuesday afternoon, police said.\n\nCops swarmed in to make arrests after throngs of protesters blocked a downtown Manhattan street, despite repeated warnings from police to clear the roadway.\n\nOne keffiyeh-clad rabble-rouser was tackled to the ground by a pair of officers during his arrest.\n\n\u201cMove, cops, get out the way, we know you\u2019re Israeli-trained,\u201d some protesters taunted during the tense, caught-on-video scene where police blocked protesters from entering City Hall Park. \u201cOink, oink, piggy, piggy. We\u2019re gonna make your lives s\u2013tty.\u201d\n\nCops blared a message on a loop warning protesters that if they remained in the roadway, they were going to be arrested and slapped with disorderly conduct charges.\n\nThe NYPD said late Tuesday one person was hit with disorderly conduct and obstructing governmental administration charges and another 11 were issued summonses.\n\nKhalil, at the center of a national firestorm, was detained Saturday by federal authorities and faces the threat of deportation for what the White House said Tuesday was peddling \u201cpro-Hamas\u201d views.\n\nThe arrest comes as President Trump has vowed to root out alleged antisemitism by foreign citizens on college campuses, including at Columbia, which has been a hotbed for fiery anti-Israel protests for the past year and a half.\n\nAbout 350 protesters started out at Washington Square Park earlier Tuesday and marched to Federal Plaza Immigration Court, grinding traffic to a halt multiple times as they chanted anti-Israel slogans and called for Khalil\u2019s freedom.\n\n\u201cThere is only one solution, intifada revolution,\u201d protesters crowed as the crowds grew to about 500.\n\nStay up to date on Columbia anti-Israel agitator Mahmoud Khalil\n\nAnti-Israel agitator Mahmoud Khalil denies feds\u2019 claim that bedbugs drove him from NJ to Louisiana lockup\n\nWho is Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University agitator detained by ICE for deportation?\n\nColumbia anti-Israel agitator Mahmoud Khalil sues to block Columbia, Barnard from releasing student records to Congress\n\nNoor Abdalla, wife of Columbia anti-Israel agitator Mahmoud Khalil, says she was \u2018naive\u2019 to think he wouldn\u2019t face arrest\n\nThe group was trying to make speeches in front of the federal courthouse in the middle of the street, but was ordered by the NYPD to keep moving. When the protest tried to enter City Hall Park, cops blocked marchers and forced them to turn around before the chaos unfolded.\n\nOne tourist visiting from Texas who saw the protest pass by her earlier Tuesday wondered why the protesters were hiding their faces with masks and Palestinian headscarves.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re embarrassed to show who they really are,\u201d Andrea Benatar, 44, told The Post.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re so proud of freeing Palestine, why not show their faces?\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like them to go and live in Gaza. They clearly have no sympathy for the Jewish people in Israel, including children, who were murdered and kidnapped,\u201d she added.\n\nPolice officers also took a man into custody after he got into an argument with a protester.\n\nA demonstrator, Anastacia Symone, 30, claimed the man grabbed a young protester by the throat and took a swing at him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to call for the release of Mahmoud Khalil. He was at home with his family when he was criminalized for expressing his freedom of speech,\u201d Symone said.\n\nProtesters argued that Khalil was targeted because he is the \u201ccornerstone in our community,\u201d calling him a \u201cpolitical prisoner.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration and the complicit Columbia University believe if they separate us from this key cornerstone of our community, our movement will begin to crumble,\u201d the protesters screamed.\n\nKhalil was being held in Louisiana ahead of a scheduled hearing before a federal judge Wednesday morning to determine the next steps in the highly controversial case.\n\nKhalil has a green card and is married to a US citizen, who is pregnant.\n\nHis legal team wants him returned to New York, arguing the federal government is \u201cengaging in blatant efforts to target and chill\u201d their client\u2019s free speech and to \u201cdiscriminate against particular viewpoints.\u201d",

        "full_text": "ESPN host Stephen A. Smith challenged Whoopi Goldberg during \u201cThe View\u201d on Tuesday over the Democratic Party\u2019s messaging problem after the liberal host attempted to defend the messaging by comparing it to President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cIf you think about him being impeached twice, 34 felony convictions, and they still elected him president, it\u2019s not about him winning. It was an indictment against the Democratic Party and what the Democratic Party was offering to American citizens. We might sit up there and talk about, \u2018Hey, you should be a party for the working class,\u2019 which the Democrats was once known for. They\u2019re not known for that right now. Why? Because their message was catering towards others and other issues, and they forgot about the people that brought them there, that elevated the Democratic Party to what it was over the last few decades. That\u2019s why they lost. He didn\u2019t win. The Democrats lost,\u201d he told the co-hosts of \u201cThe View.\u201d\n\nSmith, a Trump critic, has regularly criticized the Democratic Party and their messaging ahead of the election as well as after Trump won.\n\nCo-host Whoopi Goldberg attempted to push back on Smith and said she wanted to remind people of what those issues were, arguing they included, \u201cMaking sure that families had what they need. SNAP, making sure stuff is there. Making sure that the America that we all grew up in where you could come and be whoever you were supposed to be or want to be, you still have that right. All these things are the things that the Democrats have always said.\u201d\n\nShe then compared that to President Donald Trump\u2019s early executive actions, specifically in cutting federal jobs, as Smith pushed back.\n\n\u201cBefore you brought that up, you brought up the message that the Democratic Party was disseminating. I\u2019m challenging you on that. That is not what they were doing,\u201d he said.\n\nGoldberg shot back, \u201cOh, yes, it was. I was here. We did it.\u201d\n\nSmith went on to argue that Biden contributed to a major migrant crisis and wondered why, pointing out that former President Barack Obama deported more migrants than Trump.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line, you\u2019re Joe Biden, you open borders. Now, remember, Barack Obama deported more people than Trump did. You know what he didn\u2019t do, he didn\u2019t stick out his chest and bloviate about it, he just did it. What does Joe Biden do? Who is the Democrat, who is the vice president under Barack Obama? He opens borders. Over 12-plus million people entered the country. You had stuff going on in the streets, there was a migrant crisis,\u201d Smith said.\n\nIn the second segment, Smith made the argument that Trump did have a mandate from the American people, pointing to his gains within minority groups.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re the Democratic Party and you lost 49.8% to 48.3%, and looking at that 1.5% difference, that\u2019s an excuse to say, what we did really wasn\u2019t that bad, we should continue to do that. No, don\u2019t continue to do it, find a new strategy,\u201d he said.\n\nSmith demanded to know what Democrats were doing to win future elections, and said he would continue to interview prominent Democratic figures and ask them that question.\n\n\u201cI want somebody to step up and recognize that man in the Oval Office, whether you like it or not, is potent, he\u2019s coming, and he wins, you got to find a way to beat him,\u201d he said.",

        "full_text": "Este art\u00edculo estar\u00e1 disponible en espa\u00f1ol en El Tiempo Latino.\n\nSummary\n\nIn his first address to a joint session of Congress in his second term, President Donald Trump distorted the facts on fraud, immigration, aid to Ukraine, the economy, autism and more.\n\nTrump claimed that the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has \u201cfound hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud.\u201d However, the DOGE website currently states that the department has only generated $105 billion in savings, and only purports to provide evidence to support $19.8 billion of that total. It\u2019s unclear how much, if any, of that is related to fraud.\n\nThe president read data purportedly showing that millions of dead individuals were incorrectly labeled as alive in the Social Security database, and misleadingly claimed that \u201cmoney is being paid to many of them.\u201d Social Security Administration internal audits show that the number of dead recipients still being sent benefits is likely in the thousands, not the millions.\n\nIn talking about aid to support Ukraine\u2019s defense against Russia\u2019s invasion, Trump inflated U.S. aid by about double when he claimed that the U.S. has \u201cspent perhaps $350 billion,\u201d and he wrongly claimed Europe had spent only $100 billion. European aid is larger than that from the U.S.\n\nTrump exaggerated when he claimed to have \u201cinherited \u2026 an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare\u201d from his predecessor. Economic growth was strong, and inflation had fallen significantly.\n\nHe also wrongly said that inflation was \u201cperhaps\u201d the worst in history under President Joe Biden, and he ignored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic while claiming that the Biden administration \u201cdrove up\u201d prices on energy, groceries and other necessities.\n\nTrump misleadingly claimed that \u201cnot long ago\u201d just 1 in 10,000 children had autism. Estimates that low are from many decades ago, before the definition and awareness of the condition expanded.\n\nHe misleadingly said Biden\u2019s administration had \u201cclosed more than 100 power plants.\u201d According to the Department of Energy, the total number of electric power plants increased by 2,187 from 2020 to 2023. Coal- and petroleum-powered plants decreased.\n\nWhile talking about building up America\u2019s military might, Trump claimed that \u201cnow we have the technology\u201d for an air defense system to protect the U.S. like Israel\u2019s Iron Dome. But that technology has not been developed yet, and weapons experts question its feasibility for protecting the entire U.S.\n\nTrump repeated his unsupported claim that \u201cpeople from mental institutions and insane asylums were released into our country,\u201d and he exaggerated when he again claimed that under Biden \u201c21 million people poured into the United States.\u201d\n\nThe president misleadingly lumped Canada in with Mexico as a significant source of fentanyl in the U.S., claiming those countries have \u201callowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before.\u201d Less than 1% of fentanyl seized by border officials comes through Canada.\n\nIn pushing for more oil and natural gas drilling, Trump, again, falsely claimed that \u201cwe have more liquid gold under our feet\u201d than all other nations. There are several countries that have larger estimated oil and natural gas reserves than the U.S.\n\nHe repeated his false claims that 38,000 American lives were lost during construction of the Panama Canal and that Panama had ceded control of the canal to China.\n\nWhile this address, coming early in a new term, technically isn\u2019t a State of the Union address, Trump\u2019s March 4 speech was longer than any prior SOTU, clocking in at an hour and 39 minutes, as measured by the American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\n\nAnalysis\n\nDOGE Savings\n\nTrump claimed that the Department of Government Efficiency, led by White House adviser Elon Musk, has \u201cfound hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud.\u201d However, the most recent update on DOGE\u2019s website from March 2 reports that the department has only created an estimated $105 billion in savings thus far. Although Trump ticked off several examples of what he called \u201cappalling waste\u201d found by DOGE, it\u2019s unclear if any of the savings touted by DOGE are related to actual fraud.\n\nWe also cannot verify DOGE\u2019s savings figure, as the department has not yet uploaded evidence of each transaction it has conducted. The website includes a \u201cWall of Receipts\u201d described as \u201ca subset of contract, grant, and lease cancellations, representing ~30% of total savings.\u201d\n\nHowever, the \u201csubset\u201d of transactions listed on the website does not meet this 30% threshold. In total, DOGE\u2019s \u201cWall of Receipts\u201d lists about $19.8 billion in estimated savings, which is less than 19% of the $105 billion in total savings claimed by the department. Of this $19.8 billion in savings, $8.9 billion comes from the cancellation of contracts, $10.3 billion comes from the termination of grants, and $660 million comes from the termination of government leases.\n\nDOGE has faced scrutiny for inflating and miscalculating the savings figures posted on its website. The New York Times reported that DOGE deleted hundreds of transactions previously posted to its \u201cWall of Receipts\u201d and also found that DOGE incorrectly claimed credit for canceling government contracts that had already been terminated before Trump entered office. Other errors by DOGE identified in media reports include a typo mislabeling $8 million in savings as $8 billion and triple-counting the cancellation of a single contract.\n\nSpeaking about DOGE\u2019s efforts on Feb. 11, Musk said, \u201cWe will make mistakes, but we\u2019ll act quickly to correct any mistakes.\u201d\n\nTrump went on to cite a Government Accountability Office report that estimated annual fraud losses to the government of between $233 billion and $521 billion. But we could not verify how much, if any, of the DOGE savings identified to date includes instances of fraud. Rather, most of the savings appears to be related to spending that it deemed wasteful.\n\nOverstating Social Security Fraud\n\nIn a Feb. 16 post on X, White House adviser Elon Musk shared a screenshot of a spreadsheet denoting that the Social Security database categorizes nearly 21 million people over the age of 99 as alive. Trump read the data from Musk\u2019s post during his speech and misleadingly claimed that \u201cmoney is being paid to many of\u201d the centenarians still listed as alive.\n\nAs we\u2019ve written, internal audits conducted by the Office of Audit in the Social Security Administration\u2019s Office of the Inspector General have identified that millions of deceased individuals were still listed as living in the Social Security database. However, the number of dead recipients still being sent benefits is likely in the thousands, not the millions.\n\nIn total, the SSA distributed payments to 89,106 individuals aged 99 and older in December 2024.\n\nA July 2023 report published by the Office of Audit found that there were 18.9 million people with Social Security numbers born in 1920 or earlier with no record of their deaths. The vast majority of these records are clearly outdated, as the Pew Research Center estimated that there were only 101,000 Americans who were 100 and older in 2024.\n\nHowever, very few of these dead individuals incorrectly labeled as alive still receive Social Security benefits. Among this group of 18.9 million, the report found that only 44,000, or 0.2%, were still receiving Social Security benefits. The report did not specify how many of these benefit payments were believed to be improper. A portion of the 44,000 recipients were likely living Americans over the age of 103 who continued to receive payments in July 2023.\n\nThe Office of Audit provided a more specific estimate of improper payments to deceased individuals in a November 2021 report. That report concluded that the \u201cSSA issued approximately $298 million in payments to about 24,000 deceased beneficiaries in suspended payment status.\u201d The report also noted that while the SSA did recover some of the funds, $214 million of the improper payments remained unaccounted for.\n\nIn a statement published on Feb. 19, Lee Dudek, the newly appointed acting commissioner of the SSA, explained that the data posted by Musk does not reveal millions of dead individuals who continue to receive benefits.\n\n\u201cI also want to acknowledge recent reporting about the number of people older than age 100 who may be receiving benefits from Social Security,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reported data are people in our records with a Social Security number who do not have a date of death associated with their record. These individuals are not necessarily receiving benefits.\u201d\n\nIn September 2015, the SSA began a process that automatically designates individuals aged 115 and older as deceased and ends payments to them.\n\nExaggerating Ukraine Aid\n\nTrump repeated a claim he\u2019s made frequently in recent weeks \u2013 telling the joint session of Congress that \u201cwe\u2019ve spent perhaps $350 billion\u201d to support Ukraine\u2019s fight against the Russian invasion since 2022, while Europe has spent $100 billion. Those figures are wrong.\n\nAs we\u2019ve written before, the total amount that Congress has appropriated since 2022 is $174.2 billion. According to a report from the special inspector general who is overseeing the U.S. support for Ukraine, the U.S. has made a total of $182.75 billion available for the broader response.\n\nFigures from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German research organization that tracks funding for Ukraine, show that the U.S. has so far allocated about $121 billion compared with about $140 billion from Europe. Additionally, the institute shows that Europe has committed another $122 billion that hasn\u2019t yet been allocated, while the U.S. has committed another $5 billion. The institute\u2019s figures include direct, bilateral aid.\n\nWe didn\u2019t get an immediate response from the White House to an email asking where Trump had gotten his numbers.\n\nWhat Trump Inherited\n\nTrump exaggerated the state of the economy when he took office earlier this year, and he misleadingly placed the blame for higher consumer prices solely on the Biden administration.\n\n\u201cAs you know, we inherited, from the last administration, an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare,\u201d Trump said. \u201cTheir policies drove up energy prices, pushed up the cost of groceries, and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions of Americans. We suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country \u2014 they\u2019re not sure.\u201d\n\nAs we wrote in January, before Trump began his second presidential term, he inherited a \u201cresilient economy that has grown by at least 2.5% every year since he left office in early 2021,\u201d as well as a \u201cpost-pandemic jobs boom that has driven the unemployment rate well below the historical norm.\u201d\n\nWe also noted that inflation \u201chas come down significantly\u201d from the annual inflation rate of 9.1% in June 2022. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said that was \u201cthe largest 12-month change since the period ending November 1981\u201d \u2014 not in history, as Trump said. Most recently, the Consumer Price Index increased 3% for the 12-month period ending in January.\n\nIt\u2019s also wrong to suggest that Biden administration policies alone increased prices on energy, food and other consumer goods. As we\u2019ve also written, economists primarily blame the COVID-19 pandemic, the supply chain disruptions that followed and rising labor costs, among other reasons, for the dramatic price increases while Biden was president.\n\nAutism\n\nShortly after introducing DJ Daniel, a 13-year-old who was diagnosed six years ago with brain cancer, Trump cited two autism prevalence figures that need context.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to get toxins out of our environment, poisons out of our food supply, and keep our children healthy and strong,\u201d the president said. \u201cAs an example, not long ago \u2014 and you can\u2019t even believe these numbers \u2014 1 in 10,000 children had autism. 1 in 10,000. And now it\u2019s 1 in 36. There\u2019s something wrong. 1 in 36 \u2014 think of it.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re going to find out what it is and there\u2019s nobody better than Bobby and all of the people that are working with you,\u201d he continued, referring to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., \u201cto figure out what is going on.\u201d\n\nTrump made nearly identical remarks about the autism rate on Feb. 13 when swearing in Kennedy as the new health secretary.\n\nTrump\u2019s higher figure of 1 in 36 is correct. That\u2019s the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s latest estimate, in 2020, of the number of U.S. children who have been identified with autism.\n\nThe 1 in 10,000 number, however, is decades old \u2014 and isn\u2019t directly comparable to today\u2019s figure. As we\u2019ve explained before, some studies in the 1960s and \u201970s estimated autism affected about 1 to 5 in 10,000 kids. But these studies used a much more stringent definition of autism. Awareness and recognition of autism has also dramatically improved since then.\n\nMuch of \u201cwhat is going on,\u201d then, is actually a broader clinical definition of autism capturing more mild cases, along with better awareness. There may be a slight true increase in the condition, researchers say, in part due to known risk factors, including parents having children at older ages and more babies surviving birth complications. Autism is largely a genetic disease.\n\nKennedy and others around him have previously used the same or similar statistics to falsely suggest that vaccines may be behind the surge in autism diagnoses. Numerous studies have failed to find any link between autism and vaccines.\n\nPower Plants\n\nTrump said the Biden administration had \u201cclosed more than 100 power plants.\u201d That\u2019s misleading. The number of electric power plants went up by 2,187 since the last full year of Trump\u2019s first administration to 2023, according to the latest data from the Department of Energy\u2019s Energy Information Administration.\n\nThe number of power plants fueled by coal did decrease by 57 plants, from 284 in 2020 to 227 in 2023. Plants powered by petroleum and other fossil gas also declined by 23 plants. But the number of other types of electric power plants, including natural gas and renewable energy, went up.\n\nIn April 2024, a rule finalized by the Biden administration to limit the pollution from existing coal power plants required those plants, and any new natural gas-fired power plants, to capture 90% of their carbon emissions by 2032, if they intend to operate after 2039. The rule was contested by some Republican states and industry groups, but in October the Supreme Court decided that the rule could go into effect while legal cases work their way through the courts. During his campaign, Trump promised to kill Biden\u2019s power plant rules.\n\nEnergy Secretary Chris Wright recently advocated for the need for coal-fired power plants, Bloomberg reported. In February, the EIA reported that electricity generators plan to retire about 8 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity this year.\n\nDuring his address to Congress on Tuesday night, Trump said, \u201cWe are opening up many of those power plants right now.\u201d\n\nGolden Dome Defense System\n\nTrump said he is focused on \u201cbuilding the most powerful military of the future,\u201d and one of the first steps will be building a \u201cGolden Dome missile defense shield to protect our homeland.\u201d\n\n\u201cRonald Reagan wanted to do it long ago,\u201d Trump said, \u201cbut the technology just wasn\u2019t there, not even close. But now we have the technology. It\u2019s incredible, actually. And other places, they have it. Israel has it. Other places have it, and the United States should have it too, right?\u201d\n\nBut the technology for the U.S. isn\u2019t there yet.\n\nTrump said repeatedly during his campaign that during his presidency the U.S. would develop a missile defense system similar to Israel\u2019s Iron Dome. Israel has used that air defense system since 2011 to shoot down short-range rockets fired from neighboring Gaza. Israel\u2019s Iron Dome, along with its Arrow 3 system \u2014 an air defense system that can intercept ballistic missiles \u2014 and with help from the U.S. and others, shot down nearly 300 drones and missiles launched at Israel by Iran in April 2024.\n\nIsrael\u2019s system, developed by an Israeli company and the U.S. weapons manufacturer Raytheon, can detect and intercept \u201ca variety of shorter-range targets such as rockets, artillery and mortars,\u201d Raytheon\u2019s website explains. The system can target threats launched from 2.5 to 43.5 miles away.\n\nBut \u201cagainst the normal threats to U.S. security, the Iron Dome is not a useful system,\u201d Stephen Biddle, adjunct senior fellow for defense policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, told us when we wrote about this issue last year. \u201cIron Dome is designed to deal with short-range threats, especially unguided rockets,\u201d not long-range ballistic missiles that could be launched by China, Russia or North Korea.\n\n\u201cIf the North Koreans launched intercontinental ballistic missiles at the U.S., an Iron Dome would not be able to intercept reentry vehicles,\u201d explained Biddle, referring to the parts of intercontinental ballistic missiles carrying warheads back into Earth\u2019s atmosphere before hitting a target.\n\nThe defense technology company Lockheed Martin is apparently working on a \u201cGolden Dome\u201d system that Trump referred to in his remarks to Congress, and the Pentagon is seeking proposals from other defense contractors. The Lockheed Martin website says, \u201c[W]e will bring in the best and brightest of American innovation to rapidly develop game-changing tech \u2013 like space-based interceptors and hypersonic defenses \u2013 that will ensure America\u2019s Golden Dome stays well ahead of adversary threats.\u201d\n\nBut the Golden Dome technology is still being developed, and defense experts are skeptical that a missile defense system will be able to protect the entire U.S.\n\nImmigration\n\nTrump made several misleading and unsupported claims about immigration.\n\nTrump began by boasting that after declaring a national emergency on the southern border and cracking down on illegal immigration, by February, his first full month in office, apprehensions of those crossing the border illegally \u201cwere by far the lowest ever recorded.\u201d\n\nAlthough U.S. Customs and Border Protection has not yet released its official February apprehensions data, the agency reported via X on March 1 that February \u201csaw just 8,326 encounters at the Southwest border\u2014the lowest documented by U.S. Border Patrol.\u201d That eclipses the figure of 11,127 in April 2017, Trump\u2019s third full month in office during his first term \u2014 and previously the lowest month going back to at least 2000. However, it\u2019s not the lowest \u201cever recorded.\u201d Government data going back to 1925 shows entire years in the 1920s and 1930s that were close to the February figure.\n\nTrump went on to say that under Biden, \u201cthere were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month.\u201d Illegal immigration did soar through most of the years Biden was in office, with apprehensions by Border Patrol averaging about 150,000 per month. Apprehensions reached a monthly high of 251,178 in December 2023.\n\nBut the numbers dropped dramatically after Biden enacted emergency measures in June 2024 to restrict asylum eligibility for those illegal border-crossers. Between July and December, the last full month under Biden, apprehensions of people crossing the border illegally averaged about 55,000 per month. That\u2019s lower than the average during the last few months of Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nWe should note that after tough talk on immigration in the 2016 campaign, the number of apprehensions plummeted in the first few months of Trump\u2019s first term as well, what some referred to as \u201cthe Trump Effect.\u201d After that dip in the months immediately after he took office, apprehensions of illegal border-crossers steadily increased over the next two years, reaching a peak of 132,856 in May 2019. The figures then began to steadily decline again, going to 16,182 in April 2020 at the height of the pandemic.\n\nTrump also made his oft-repeated but unsupported claim that \u201cpeople from mental institutions and insane asylums were released into our country.\u201d As we have written, immigration experts in the U.S. and in countries in South America where Trump has alleged that kind of activity have told us they have seen no evidence of that.\n\nAnd finally, Trump claimed that \u201cover the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States.\u201d As we have written, that\u2019s double the total number of people caught trying to enter the country illegally (7.3 million, which includes repeat attempts), those who came to legal ports of entry without authorization to enter (1.2 million), and the estimated number who evaded capture (2 million). Comprehensive Department of Homeland Security data on the initial processing of these encounters show that 2.9 million were removed by CBP and 3.2 million were released with notices to appear in immigration court or report to Immigration and Customs Enforcement or given other classifications, such as parole.\n\nFentanyl Smuggling\n\nWhile talking about his reasons for putting new 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, Trump claimed that both countries have \u201callowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens.\u201d But comparing Canada to Mexico is misleading.\n\nNo one knows exactly how much illicit fentanyl comes into the U.S. each year because comprehensive data is not available. U.S. Customs and Border Protection does publish drug seizure statistics, which are often used as a proxy for how much gets into the country undetected.\n\nThe 43 pounds of fentanyl seized by authorities at the northern border in fiscal year 2024 is more than the 2 pounds seized in fiscal 2023 and the 14 pounds seized in fiscal 2022. But that is significantly less than the 21,148 pounds of fentanyl seized by officials at the southwest border with Mexico during the 2024 fiscal cycle.\n\nAs we\u2019ve written, for at least the last three full fiscal years, the amount of fentanyl captured coming into the U.S. from Canada has made up less than 1% of the fentanyl seized nationwide by the Border Patrol and the Office of Field Operations.\n\n\u2018Liquid Gold\u2019\n\nTrump repeated a false claim about the oil and natural gas reserves in the U.S.\n\n\u201cAs you\u2019ve heard me say many times, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on earth, and by far,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd now, I fully authorize the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it. It\u2019s called drill, baby, drill.\u201d\n\nAs we\u2019ve written before, Trump is wrong. The Brookings Institution has noted that while \u201cestimating reserves is an inexact science and methodologies differ,\u201d the U.S. generally ranks between ninth and 11th in the world in the size of its crude oil reserves, and it ranks fourth or fifth in recoverable natural gas reserves.\n\nAnd although Trump would like oil and gas companies to do more drilling, it\u2019s worth noting that oil and gas production in the U.S. already reached new record levels in 2024.\n\nPanama Canal\n\nTrump wrongly repeated his claims that 38,000 American lives were lost during construction of the Panama Canal and that Panama had ceded control of the canal to China.\n\nThe canal was \u201cbuilt at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure, 38,000 workers died building the Panama Canal. They died of malaria. They died of snake bites and mosquitoes. Not a nice place to work,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAs we have written, Trump grossly overstates the number of American lives lost building the canal. About 7,600 people died during the more than decade-long American phase of the construction of the Panama Canal, which started in 1904, according to Noel Maurer, an associate professor of international affairs and international business at George Washington University, and co-author of the book, \u201cThe Big Ditch: How America Took, Built, Ran, and Ultimately Gave Away the Panama Canal.\u201d\n\nMost of those deaths weren\u2019t Americans, Maurer told us via email. \u201cRather, about two-thirds of them were either West Indian (mostly from Barbados), and a smaller unknown share of Spanish laborers who were hired at the start of construction.\u201d In total, fewer than 1,000 Americans died due to accident or infectious disease during the canal\u2019s construction phase, he said.\n\nTrump also continued to falsely suggest that China has been operating the canal.\n\nThe canal \u201cwas given away by the Carter administration for $1 but that agreement has been violated very severely,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we\u2019re taking it back.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not accurate to say the canal was given to China. A Hong Kong-based company managed ports at either end of the canal, which has raised concerns among some in the U.S., including the head of U.S. Southern Command, who last year warned Congress the ports could be used by the Chinese military as \u201cpoints of future multi-domain access.\u201d But canal experts and Panamanian officials have said China had no involvement in operation of the canal.\n\nAnd in any case, as Trump noted in his speech, an American investment group led by BlackRock has agreed to purchase both ports owned by the Hong Kong company.",

        "full_text": "Este art\u00edculo estar\u00e1 disponible en espa\u00f1ol en El Tiempo Latino.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans are accusing one another of \u201clying\u201d about what a House Republican budget resolution means for Medicaid, and both sides have made misleading or speculative comments. There\u2019s little doubt the health care program would face cuts under the plan \u2014 and it would have to if Medicare cuts are off limits.\n\nDemocrats have seized on the resolution\u2019s call for the Energy and Commerce Committee to cut $880 billion in spending over 10 years. The committee\u2019s options for those reductions are almost entirely in spending for Medicaid, a federal-state program that provides health care for low-income people, and Medicare, the federal program that covers seniors.\n\nRepublicans have said the legislation doesn\u2019t pinpoint any specific changes to Medicaid, which is correct but sidesteps the reality that the bulk of the spending cuts would likely be to that program. Democrats, meanwhile, have speculated that hospitals and nursing homes will close, impacts that aren\u2019t known without details of how federal spending will be trimmed and how states will react.\n\nThe resolution that narrowly passed the House on Feb. 25 along party lines has several legislative hurdles to overcome before any spending cuts materialize. Most notably, it still needs to pass the Senate, where some Republicans want to change the legislation. The budget resolution is the first step to Congress using a maneuver called reconciliation to extend the 2017 tax cuts, most of which are set to expire at the end of this year. Reconciliation enables a tax and spending bill to pass the Senate with a simple majority, rather than 60 votes.\n\nThe House resolution lays out the broad parameters of extending the 2017 tax cut provisions and enacting some new cuts, at a cost of $4.5 trillion over 10 years, and reducing government spending by $2 trillion over the same time period. Both houses of Congress need to agree on this or another budget framework before lawmakers can then propose legislation on the specific ways they would cut and spend their way to those figures. (See slide 11 here for a flowchart on the process from the Committee on a Responsible Federal Budget.)\n\nWe\u2019ll go through several claims about the resolution.\n\nSize of Medicaid Cuts\n\nLawmakers have made conflicting statements about how much would need to be cut from Medicaid under the House resolution.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Pete Aguilar, Feb. 25 press conference: Now some of our friends on the other side of the aisle will say, \u201cThis is just a procedural step. Please don\u2019t hold this vote against me.\u201d Here\u2019s the truth: This vote doesn\u2019t just open the door for Medicaid cuts, it guarantees them.\n\nRepublican Rep. Steve Scalise, Feb. 25 press conference: The word Medicaid is not even in this bill. This bill doesn\u2019t even mention the word Medicaid a single time. And yet, all Democrats are doing is lying about what\u2019s in the budget because they don\u2019t want to talk about the truth of what we\u2019re voting to start.\n\nAs we said, the Senate would still need to pass the resolution, and lawmakers then would need to agree on the specific spending cuts. But Aguilar has a point that the $880 billion would have to touch Medicaid, unless lawmakers wanted to find the reductions in Medicare \u2014 which may be even more politically challenging. Plus, House Republicans already have talked about some options for Medicaid cuts, such as adding work requirements and finding efficiencies in the program.\n\nScalise is correct in saying the legislation doesn\u2019t include the word \u201cMedicaid.\u201d But, again, there\u2019s little doubt that the program would face spending reductions \u2014 and they could be substantial, as we\u2019ll explain.\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan budget watchdog group, said in a Feb. 20 post that \u201cit would likely be nearly impossible to meet the [$880 billion] target without including some Medicaid reductions.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Rep. Brendan Boyle, Feb. 25 press conference: If Energy and Commerce Committee said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to cut Medicaid, instead we will cut literally everything else we possibly can 100%,\u201d that only gets you about halfway to the $880 billion. So, by definition, they have to, as a minimum, cut hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicaid.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Feb. 27 press conference: Republicans are lying to the American people about Medicaid. The Republican budget authorizes up to $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid by directing the Energy and Commerce Committee to find those spending cuts. Everybody knows who has had any connection to the congressional budget that if you are directing the Energy and Commerce Committee to find up to $880 billion, if not more, in spending cuts, that means Medicaid.\n\nAll $880 billion over 10 years doesn\u2019t have to come out of Medicaid, as Jeffries suggested in a Feb. 27 news conference, but Boyle is correct that there\u2019s no way to get around sizable cuts to Medicaid \u2014 unless, again, lawmakers turn to cutting Medicare.\n\nOn Jan. 27, President Donald Trump said he would again \u201cpledge,\u201d as he did repeatedly during the campaign: \u201cI will not sign any bill that cuts even a single penny from Medicare or Social Security for our great seniors.\u201d He has said similar things about Medicaid, though he has left open the possibility of cutting waste or \u201cfraud\u201d from all three programs.\n\nRobin Rudowitz, a vice president and director for the program on Medicaid and the uninsured at KFF, a health policy research group, told us that \u201cthe large majority\u201d of the $880 billion \u201cis likely to come out of Medicaid,\u201d and if Medicare cuts are off the table, there\u2019s \u201cno other way to get to that magnitude of savings\u201d without Medicaid cuts.\n\nCJ Young, a spokesperson for the Democrats on the Energy and Commerce Committee told us: \u201cOf the funding that\u2019s available for the Committee to cut, approximately 98% percent of that is either Medicare or Medicaid funding. So if you take Trump at his word that he\u2019s not touching Medicare, then the vast majority of the cuts will have to come out of the safety net health care program.\u201d\n\nWe asked a spokesperson for the Republicans on the committee about this, but we haven\u2019t received a response.\n\nIn breaking down the numbers of what the Energy and Commerce Committee can trim, the New York Times said that if the committee eliminates all non-health care spending, \u201cit will still be more than $600 billion short\u201d of that $880 billion target.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that this 880 number is targeting Energy and Commerce, and the place where they have the ability to make cuts is going to be in Medicaid,\u201d Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy\u2019s Center for Children and Families, told us.\n\nMedicaid is jointly funded by the states and the federal government; the federal share over the next 10 years is estimated at $8.2 trillion. So, it would be about an 11% cut if all $880 billion came out of Medicaid.\n\nMedicare spending over 10 years is even higher \u2014 approximately $15.8 trillion, according to this New York Times analysis. The Energy and Commerce Committee oversees about another $600 billion that it could trim, including money for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\n\nIf this budget resolution moves forward, the committee would have to find the entire $880 billion in deficit reduction, Chris Towner, CRFB\u2019s policy director, told us in an email. \u201cIf push comes to shove and lawmakers don\u2019t think they can meet those instructions, they would need to amend the budget resolution,\u201d he said.\n\nImpact of Potential Cuts\n\nDemocrats have claimed that hospitals would close and people would lose health coverage, while Republicans have said any cuts would be to waste, fraud and abuse. Without the specifics on spending reductions, the impacts aren\u2019t known, but experts told us that large cuts in federal funding would leave states with budget gaps and tough choices on what to do about them.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Frank Pallone, Feb. 25, CNBC: Well, I think the problem is that the Republican leadership is lying to the rank and file Republicans. In other words, they know that these Medicaid cuts will really take away health care from so many people and close hospitals and close nursing homes.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ted Lieu, Feb. 25 press conference: And what does $880 billion of Medicaid look like? It means the shutting down of community health clinics, the shutting down of hospitals, the shutting down of nursing homes.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, Feb. 27, : We\u2019re going to take care of those who are rightful beneficiaries of the programs. We\u2019re going to cut the fraud, waste and abuse out of Medicaid, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to get part of the savings to accomplish this mission. \u2026 There\u2019s about $50 billion estimated that are lost every year in Medicaid just in fraud alone.\n\nTrump, Feb. 26, Cabinet meeting: We\u2019re not going to touch it [Medicaid, Medicare or Social Security]. Now, we are going to look for fraud. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re OK with that, like people that shouldn\u2019t be on, people that are illegal aliens and others, criminals in many cases.\n\nMedicaid is funded jointly by states and the federal government, which provides matching funds of at least 50%, as KFF explains. An expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act provides a match of 90% in federal funding. About 21% of the U.S. population, or 83 million people, have Medicaid coverage, including those with low income and disabilities, as well as seniors. Medicaid, not Medicare, covers long-term care expenses for the elderly.\n\nRudowitz at KFF told us that changes the federal government makes to Medicaid financing \u201creally gets transferred to the states,\u201d which then \u201chave to figure out how they\u2019re going to respond to those cuts.\u201d She said states could raise revenue, make cuts to other parts of their budgets or cut their Medicaid programs \u2014 and the latter option could mean cutting coverage or benefits, or the payment rates to health care providers. \u201cAll states might respond differently,\u201d she said.\n\nShe noted that while most of Medicaid\u2019s enrollees are children and adults, most of the spending is for people with disabilities and seniors, because of their high health care costs.\n\nCuello at Georgetown told us an $880 billion cut is \u201cgigantic\u201d and \u201corders of magnitude too large to not be destructive.\u201d He, too, said that the \u201cfinal cuts might be made by states.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo in other words, you might reduce state funding by some gigantic number, and then the state has to react to that, and we can\u2019t predict, we can\u2019t tell you exactly what they\u2019re going to do,\u201d Cuello said.\n\nWe asked if he thought the potential impact would be as severe as community health centers, hospitals or nursing homes closing, as Democrats have claimed. \u201cYes, I do,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can predict that that is going to happen exactly in every state. Those things are the downstream consequences.\u201d\n\nCuello noted that rural hospital closure is already a problem. \u201cAnd if you defund the system \u2026 there are going to be hospitals that go over the brink,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a Feb. 20 post, CRFB identified what it called \u201cstate financing gimmicks\u201d that it said could be changed or eliminated to save federal dollars. It said that \u201cincremental policy changes could improve the integrity of the Medicaid program and prevent states from unfairly gaming Medicaid\u2019s financing laws while also leading to savings.\u201d One example is lowering or banning Medicaid provider taxes, which are now capped at 6%.\n\n\u201cAs we have discussed, states often tax providers up to 6 percent of providers\u2019 revenue and then use those funds to remit payments back to providers, reporting the payments to the federal government in the process to collect matching funds,\u201d which \u201cessentially\u201d boosts the Medicaid match, CRFB said. It estimated savings of $240 billion to $610 billion over a decade if provider taxes were restricted or eliminated, respectively.\n\nTowner told us his organization\u2019s post showed that \u201cfinding Medicaid savings also does not necessarily mean slashing Medicaid or even benefits \u2013 there are lots of non-benefit savings options available that could be used to fulfill this savings.\u201d\n\nRudowitz and Cuello, however, said that a reduction in provider taxes would still leave states with a budget gap for their Medicaid programs. Some could argue that there should be more transparency and restrictions on provider taxes, Rudowitz said, but on the other side, \u201cthere are tradeoffs and consequences\u201d to states getting less in federal matching funds.\n\nAs for Johnson\u2019s and Trump\u2019s claims about finding fraud, that\u2019s unlikely to result in a sizable amount of savings \u2014 and certainly not $880 billion, these experts said. Johnson referred to $50 billion in fraud in Medicaid each year, but the Government Accountability Office estimated that amount for \u201cimproper payments\u201d in fiscal year 2023 not solely \u201cfraud.\u201d\n\nThe GAO said that improper payments include overpayments and underpayments or payments that shouldn\u2019t have been made. That can include fraud, \u201cbut not all improper payments are the result of fraud,\u201d the report said. It didn\u2019t give an estimate for fraud, saying that \u201cestimates of improper payments cannot be used to determine the extent of fraud in a particular program.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s office hasn\u2019t responded to our inquiry about his claim.\n\nOften improper payments are missing some documents or paperwork, Rudowitz and Cuello said, and it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the payment shouldn\u2019t have been made.\n\nAndy Schneider, also a research professor at Georgetown\u2019s McCourt School of Public Policy, wrote a January blog post about Medicaid fraud. He said that fraud does occur \u2014 mostly on the part of unscrupulous providers, who, when caught, are charged with crimes. But there isn\u2019t a good estimate of how much fraud there might be.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services also provides estimates on improper payments and recommendations on how to reduce them, Schneider explained. HHS\u2019 fiscal year 2024 report estimated Medicaid\u2019s improper payment rate at 5.09%, or $31.1 billion for the year. Of this amount, 74.3% was classified as improper due to \u201cinsufficient documentation.\u201d The report said: \u201cThe insufficient documentation errors include claims where information was missing, or states did not follow appropriate processes to determine if a payment was proper or improper.\u201d\n\nAs Schneider said, \u201chad the information been available, the claim may have been payable (or not).\u201d\n\nIn his interview on on Feb. 27, Johnson said adding work requirements was one possibility for cutting Medicaid spending (which would save about $100 billion over 10 years, according to the Times). But a per-capita cap on funding or reducing the federal match (measures that would save hundreds of billions more) weren\u2019t being considered, he said.\n\n\u201cLook, everybody needs to watch the process play out,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take us five or six weeks, probably, to dig through all those details and come up with the final proposal.\u201d",

        "full_text": "Este art\u00edculo estar\u00e1 disponible en espa\u00f1ol en El Tiempo Latino.\n\nIn arguing for more tariffs on goods imported to the United States, President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that the U.S. was its \u201crichest\u201d or \u201cwealthiest\u201d during the late 1800s and early 1900s because of tariffs. In multiple ways, his claim is wrong or misleading.\n\nIn terms of the overall U.S. economy, real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product per capita is many times higher today than it was during the so-called Gilded Age, which was a post-Civil War period of economic prosperity \u2013 largely for the wealthy \u2013 amid the nation\u2019s industrial expansion.\n\nIn addition, several economists have said that Trump and others have given too much credit to tariffs for the economic growth that did occur in America more than 100 years ago. For example, in a 2000 paper, Douglas Irwin, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College, wrote: \u201cThat tariffs coincided with rapid growth in the late nineteenth century does not imply a causal relationship.\u201d Irwin and other economists and historians have said that other factors, such as immigration and increased labor productivity, contributed more to the growth in that era.\n\nBut the way Trump tells it, the U.S. was at its best economically many, many years ago, because tariffs, otherwise known as customs duties, were a significant source of federal revenue.\n\n\u201cOur country is going to become rich again, very rich,\u201d Trump said at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 22, when talking about new tariffs that he announced this year on imports from China and imports of steel and aluminum from all foreign countries.\n\nHe continued, \u201cThe word tariff is my favorite word in the dictionary. You know, we were richest, the richest, relatively, from, think of this, from 1870 to 1913. That was our richest because we collected tariffs from foreign countries that came in and took our jobs and took our money, took our everything, but they charged tariffs.\u201d\n\nTrump has even made the dubious suggestion that tariffs could be used to replace the federal income tax, which became law in 1913, with the ratification of the 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Federal income taxes account for about half of federal revenue each year.\n\n\u201cBut you could wipe out your income tax. You could maybe not even have an income tax system when this thing works out,\u201d Trump said while discussing tariffs at a dinner with Republican governors on Feb. 20.\n\n\u201cBecause in the old days that\u2019s what happened. Our country was the richest ever from 1870 to 1913. That\u2019s when we were actually the richest and we were a full tariff country.\u201d\n\nTariff revenue accounted for no more than about 60% of federal receipts during that period, according to a 2024 analysis by the White House Council of Economic Advisers. And more importantly, economists have said that it\u2019s highly unlikely that the U.S. could raise enough money from tariffs on imported goods to match current income tax revenues.\n\nIn fiscal year 2024, just 1.7% of the more than $4.9 trillion in federal receipts came from customs duties on imports.\n\nThe \u2018Richest\u2019 Claim\n\nWe don\u2019t know exactly how Trump defines the terms \u201crichest\u201d or \u201cwealthiest.\u201d We contacted the White House press office, but have not received a response.\n\nWhen the New York Times wrote about Trump\u2019s tariff remarks at this year\u2019s CPAC, the newspaper said, \u201cA White House spokeswoman noted [to the Times] that wages and the economy grew rapidly during the Gilded Age, but did not provide evidence of unparalleled prosperity in that era.\u201d\n\nIn addition, based on real GDP per capita, Trump\u2019s claim is false \u2013 because it is much higher now than it was more than a century ago.\n\nAs of 2022, it was $58,487 \u2013 nearly six times higher than $10,108 in 1913 and more than 12 times higher than $4,803 in 1870. That\u2019s according to inflation-adjusted data from the Oxford University-based project Our World in Data, which calculated historical real GDP per capita based on international prices in 2011.\n\nTrump has said that, because of tariffs, the U.S. had \u201cso much money\u201d at that time that \u201cwe didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d In that context, he may have been alluding to the fact that in many of the years between 1870 and 1913, the federal government had budget surpluses, which occur when federal receipts exceed outlays.\n\nThe president has also falsely claimed that the U.S. had \u201cno debt\u201d during that period, and he has often mentioned a legitimate debate that occurred in 1888 over what to do about excess federal revenue due to high tariffs. Democrats wanted to cut tariff rates to lower revenue while Republicans wanted to raise tariffs more to discourage imports and reduce revenue.\n\nBut the U.S. also has had surpluses in years when tariffs were a significantly smaller share of federal revenues \u2014 such as in the 1920s, which was after the federal income tax was enacted in 1913 and became the primary source of funding for the government by far.\n\n\u201cThis is just a function of government revenue growing faster than government spending,\u201d Jeremy Horpedahl, associate professor of economics at the University of Central Arkansas, wrote about the surpluses in a February blog post about Trump\u2019s \u201crichest\u201d claims. \u201cAnd the growth of revenue during the 1870s and 1880s was largely driven by a rise in internal revenue \u2014 specifically, excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco (these taxes largely didn\u2019t exist before the Civil War).\u201d\n\nMost recently, the U.S. had four consecutive budget surpluses in fiscal years 1998 to 2001. At that time, tariffs made up about 1% of annual federal receipts.\n\n\u2018Other, Bigger\u2019 Economic Factors\n\nIn general, some economists have said that supporters of tariffs, including Trump, have left the inaccurate impression that tariffs alone were the reason for the wider economic growth that occurred after the Civil War.\n\nFor example, in 2018, during Trump\u2019s first term in office, Dartmouth\u2019s Irwin did a podcast interview with American Enterprise Institute senior fellow James Pethokoukis, in which Irwin said said it was a \u201csimplistic argument\u201d to say that tariffs were responsible for rapid growth in the late 1800s:\n\nIrwin, Aug. 31, 2018: But when you look at that era actually in the late 19th century the U.S. was very open. We were open for immigration and we indeed had massive immigration. We were open to capital from the rest of the world and were able to borrow and purchase a lot of technology. So, it\u2019s not as though we were an isolationist country with big barriers. Yes, we did have fairly stiff tariffs on imported manufactured goods, but otherwise we were very open to what was going on in the world economy.\n\nIn fact immigration, as I point out in the book [\u201cClashing Over Commerce: A History of US Trade Policy\u201c], was actually a key instigator in terms of the development of many manufacturing industries in the United States. \u2026\n\nIn addition, it\u2019s become very hard actually to attribute U.S. economic growth in the late 19th century to those higher tariffs. A lot of the key improvements in technology and a lot of the growth was in the service sector: telecommunications, railroads, and things of that sort. Manufacturing really didn\u2019t grow much as a share of GDP in the late 19th century. A lot of that grew actually in the pre-Civil War period when tariffs were actually much lower \u2014 only in the range of 20% or so.\n\nSo, there is the simplistic argument that one encounters a lot \u2014 that tariffs allowed us to grow rapidly in the late 19th century \u2014 but the more you look into it you see it\u2019s a really tough case to make. A lot of other factors were involved and the tariffs were probably third or fourth order. And it\u2019s not even clear they had a positive impact as opposed to a negative impact.\n\nIn his 2000 paper, Irwin said he found \u201cthat growth then was driven largely by labor force expansion and capital accumulation, while productivity growth was undistinguished when put in a comparative perspective.\u201d He ultimately concluded that tariffs were \u201cprobably not a key factor.\u201d\n\nLikewise, in a 2024 commentary piece, in which he cited work by Irwin and other economists, Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics and trade policy studies at the Cato Institute, wrote: \u201cIn sum, U.S. tariffs imposed after the Civil War likely helped some American manufacturers and harmed others, but they were generally neither a major driver of nor drag on the sector\u2019s and economy\u2019s growth, which was instead driven by other, bigger factors, such as increasing productivity and an expanding labor force.\u201d\n\nLincicome said that \u201cno one should expect tariffs \u2013 whether back then or today \u2013 to drive the U.S. economy given all the other, bigger factors at play and the fact that trade just is a relatively small share of economic output.\u201d\n\nTariffs vs. Income Taxes\n\nEconomists have been just as critical of Trump\u2019s suggestion that the revenue from higher tariffs could be a substitute for federal income tax collections.\n\nIn October, after Trump had suggested on a number of occasions that tariffs could replace the federal income tax, Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy for the Tax Foundation, wrote a column explaining why the math wouldn\u2019t work.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has floated a proposal to replace the U.S. income tax system with a new system of tariffs, moving the United States back to the tax mix of the late 19th century. The plan, simply put, is a mathematical impossibility,\u201d she wrote.\n\nYork noted that, in fiscal year 2023, the government collected $2.2 trillion from the individual income tax and only about $80 billion from tariffs. To make up the difference, Trump would have to impose an across-the-board tariff of 70% on all imported goods, she said.\n\nWhat Trump suggested \u201cis unworkable because of the sharp difference in the size of the respective tax bases,\u201d York wrote, noting that projected adjusted gross income was $15.6 trillion and goods imports were $3.1 trillion in fiscal 2023.\n\nSubstantially higher tariffs would also likely lead to a reduction in imports. \u201cTrump\u2019s calculation ignores the precipitous drop in imports a tax increase of this magnitude would cause,\u201d she said.\n\nKimberly Clausing and Maurice Obstfeld, both senior fellows at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, made similar points in a June post that asked, \u201cCan tariffs replace the income tax?\u201d\n\n\u201cSimply put, no,\u201d was their answer. \u201cIt is literally impossible for tariffs to fully replace income taxes. Tariff rates would have to be implausibly high on such a small base of imports to replace the income tax, and as tax rates rose, the base itself would shrink as imports fall, making Trump\u2019s $2 trillion goal unattainable.\u201d\n\nClausing and Obstfeld said that scrapping the income tax in favor of higher tariffs would cause job losses, higher inflation, larger federal deficits and a recession.\n\n\u201cIt would also shift the tax burden away from the well off, substantially increasing the tax burden on the poor and middle class,\u201d they argued.\n\nThe income tax is considered to be progressive because higher-income households have a higher tax burden. On the other hand, tariffs are considered to be regressive taxes because they affect lower-income households more than others as a percentage of income. U.S. importers pay the tariff, but the costs are usually passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.",

        "full_text": "Este art\u00edculo estar\u00e1 disponible en espa\u00f1ol en El Tiempo Latino.\n\nFollowing the release of the latest jobs report on March 7, President Donald Trump suggested that his administration \u2014 which has been in office since Jan. 20 \u2014 is responsible for significant job growth. The growth in February was steady, but to support his claims, Trump made several misleading statements about the economy he inherited.\n\nThe February jobs report delivered on expectations, saying that the economy added 151,000 jobs \u2014 slightly below the forecasted 160,000. The unemployment rate was 4.1%, up marginally from 4% in January.\n\nEconomists described the report as showing a generally steady labor market for now, with Brookings Institution fellow and University of Michigan professor Justin Wolfers calling the report \u201csplendidly dull.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll unpack three of the claims Trump made on March 7 during his remarks from the Oval Office about the report.\n\nThe president compared the 9,000 new auto manufacturing jobs in February to a loss of more than 27,000 jobs in President Joe Biden\u2019s last year \u2014 ignoring that there was a net gain of those jobs over Biden\u2019s entire term. He also suggested that his tariff policy was responsible for the new jobs, but Trump\u2019s tariffs had not yet been enacted in the period covered by the jobs report.\n\nHe claimed to be \u201cpresiding over a brand-new domestic manufacturing boom after major collapse under Biden,\u201d but an expert told us he\u2019s been in office for too short of a time to have effected any major economic change. And the data show there was a net gain in manufacturing jobs during Biden\u2019s administration.\n\nTrump cherry-picked data to misleadingly claim that \u201c1 in every 4 jobs created in America was a government job\u201d in Biden\u2019s last two years as president, while \u201c93% of all job gains\u201d during the first full month of Trump\u2019s second term \u201cwere in the private sector.\u201d During Biden\u2019s entire presidency, about 11% of the jobs added were government jobs, the vast majority of which were state and local government jobs.\n\nAuto Manufacturing Jobs\n\nTrump highlighted gains in auto manufacturing jobs, saying, \u201cin a single month, 9,000 new auto jobs. You haven\u2019t heard that in a long time. After autoworkers lost more than 27,000 auto jobs in the final year of Biden.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s figures are correct, but over Biden\u2019s entire term, auto manufacturing jobs went up.\n\nWhile there hasn\u2019t been monthly job growth since July, over Biden\u2019s term, motor vehicle and parts jobs went up by 47,000. Employment in January was 9,900 higher than the pre-pandemic level in February 2020.\n\nAnd while Trump claimed that before the February increase, there hadn\u2019t been such a large one-month jump \u201cin a long time,\u201d there were larger one-month increases under Biden. The February jobs report showed an increase since January of 8,900 jobs in the manufacturing of motor vehicles and parts. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there was an increase of 28,400 jobs in that sector between October and November 2023.\n\nAlso, just because the one-month increase happened while Trump is in office doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that he\u2019s responsible for it, Alan Tonelson, a longtime analyst of U.S. manufacturing policy who blogs at RealityChek, told us in a phone interview.\n\nThe kinds of decisions that result in jobs are long-term decisions, Tonelson said, using the example of new factories, which take time to build.\n\nTrump, though, claimed that his tariff policies had already affected the February job numbers. He said the reason for the one-month gain was \u201clargely\u201d because car companies \u201cthink things are happening, so they\u2019re already geared up. In some cases, they had rooms in their plants, or they had empty plants that they were able to put into use quickly because they see \u2014 because of the tariffs. They don\u2019t want to be dealing with other places,\u201d he said, mentioning Mexico and Canada.\n\nWhen we asked the White House about the president\u2019s claim, it provided examples of auto companies making announcements about new plants or production. But most of the plans began before Trump took office, and it\u2019s unclear if any of them led to new jobs in February.\n\nThe White House pointed to production at a Georgia Hyundai plant. Construction of the vehicle and battery manufacturing plant was announced in 2022, and it began producing electric cars in October. However, the CEO, Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz, has pointed to Hyundai\u2019s investment in U.S. production over the last few years as insulation from potential tariffs from the Trump administration.\n\nThe White House also pointed to two announcements of plants opening \u2014 for electric batteries and electric vehicles \u2014 but the projects were in the works well before Trump\u2019s election.\n\nIt also cited a $1.5 million Michigan Economic Development Program grant that is anticipated to create 144 jobs manufacturing hydrogen fuel cells and plans for a Chicago-area assembly plant to reopen in 2027. Plans to reopen the assembly plant were announced shortly after the company\u2019s chairman met with Trump and months after a pressure campaign from the United Auto Workers. But neither of those projects has produced jobs yet.\n\nAnd the White House pointed to the same March 3 story that the president appeared to reference in his address to a joint session of Congress on March 4, when he said that Honda had announced it would build a new plant in Indiana. But after that address, Honda told a news station in Indianapolis: \u201cHonda has made no such announcement and will not comment on this report. The Honda Civic has been made in our Indiana Auto Plant since the facility opened in 2008 based on our longstanding approach to build products close to the customer. We have the flexibility to produce products in each region based on customer needs and market conditions.\u201d\n\nSo, it\u2019s unclear if Honda is planning to change its Indiana operations due to tariffs, but no jobs associated with any potential change would have been included in the February report, either.\n\nIt remains to be seen what impact Trump\u2019s tariff policies might have on the auto industry. So far, 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel imports went into effect on March 12, with the EU and Canada immediately implementing retaliatory tariffs. Broad 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, including on vehicles, are largely on hold until April 2.\n\nSome industry watchers have been skeptical of the benefits from tariffs for the auto industry. \u201cUltimately, in a global automotive business that relies on a large and complicated supply chain, higher tariffs will only challenge further an industry already wrestling with high costs and small margins,\u201d Cox Automotive wrote in an early February analysis.\n\nManufacturing Jobs\n\nThe president also said, \u201cOur administration is presiding over a brand-new domestic manufacturing boom after major collapse under Biden.\u201d\n\nBut the data don\u2019t support that claim.\n\nTrump said, \u201cDuring the last year, the Biden administration saw a loss of more than 110,000 manufacturing jobs. \u2026 During the first full month in office, we\u2019ve not only stopped that manufacturing collapse, but we\u2019ve begun to rapidly reverse it and get major gains. We created 10,000 manufacturing jobs in February alone. That hasn\u2019t happened in a long time.\u201d\n\nThere was a 20,000 gain in manufacturing jobs in November, so it has only been a few months since there has been such a one-month increase.\n\nTrump is correct about the net loss over Biden\u2019s last year \u2014 it was 111,000 \u2014 but again, over Biden\u2019s four years, manufacturing jobs went up by 610,000. In January, there were almost 12.8 million manufacturing jobs, 12,000 more than in February 2020, before the pandemic.\n\nFactory construction also reached the highest level in more than 50 years in 2024, according to a report from Moody\u2019s Analytics.\n\nForbes wrote last year that Biden-era policies, including the CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act, \u201cspurred an influx of foreign direct investment and a surge in factory construction. But the anticipated jobs have taken a while to materialize in great numbers and will not arrive until after his presidency ends.\u201d\n\nWhen Trump touted the \u201cbrand-new domestic manufacturing boom,\u201d he said that it had been \u201cconfirmed\u201d by the ISM and S&P manufacturing surveys, which are conducted by private companies that survey purchasing managers to provide an indicator of economic conditions.\n\nThe surveys did report expansion in manufacturing.\n\nThe S&P survey reported that \u201cFebruary survey data indicated an acceleration in the rate of US manufacturing sector expansion.\u201d However, it said there was \u201csome evidence\u201d that the growth was \u201cpartially driven by advanced purchases ahead of likely price increases and possible supply disruption related to further tariff impositions in the coming months.\u201d\n\nThe ISM for February said that the sector \u201cexpanded for the second month in a row in February after 26 consecutive months of contraction.\u201d Many survey respondents reporting uncertainty and volatility due to tariffs.\n\n\u201cManufacturing, generally speaking, is cyclical,\u201d Tonelson said. \u201cManufacturing is quite export heavy,\u201d so it depends on what\u2019s happening in other countries, too.\n\nBut, overall, Tonelson said, \u201cI don\u2019t think that one can make any reasonable conclusion about booming of anything after just about a month and a half. In terms of manufacturing jobs, we\u2019ve only got one month of data on President Trump\u2019s watch this time.\u201d\n\nPublic vs. Private Jobs\n\nTrump also used cherry-picked statistics when comparing government and private-sector jobs added under him and Biden.\n\n\u201cUnder the final two years of Biden, 1 in every 4 jobs created in America was a government job. That\u2019s a tremendous percentage,\u201d he said. \u201cBut under the first full month of President Trump, which we haven\u2019t even gotten started yet, an incredible 93% of all job gains were in the private sector.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that about one-quarter, or roughly 26%, of the jobs added in Biden\u2019s last two years in office were government jobs, which includes positions in federal, state and local government. However, during Biden\u2019s entire presidency, about 11% of the jobs added were government jobs \u2014 including some jobs that were lost, but quickly regained, during the pandemic. And about 9 in 10 of the government jobs gained were at the state and local level, which Biden had no direct say in.\n\nMeasuring from June 2022, when total employment finally surpassed the pre-pandemic high in February 2020, about 22% of the increase in employment was government jobs. Again, roughly 90% of the jobs were in state and local government.\n\nIt\u2019s also misleading to compare one month of private-sector job growth at the start of Trump\u2019s second term \u2014 about 93% of the jobs gained in February were private-sector jobs, as Trump said \u2014 to a much longer period under Biden.\n\nFor instance, in December, one of Biden\u2019s final months in office, only 11% of all jobs added were government jobs. A month before that in November, it was about 6.5%. There were also a few months during Biden\u2019s last two years in office when there was an increase in total jobs but a decline in government jobs.",

        "full_text": "Este art\u00edculo estar\u00e1 disponible en espa\u00f1ol en El Tiempo Latino.\n\nLegal experts say there is nothing to President Donald Trump\u2019s claims that several of former President Joe Biden\u2019s pardons are \u201cVOID\u201d because they were signed via autopen.\n\nWhite House lawyers during the George W. Bush administration said the use of an autopen is perfectly legal, and constitutional scholars say that nothing in the Constitution even requires pardons to be signed anyway. And, they note, pardons cannot simply be overturned by a subsequent president.\n\nTrump is correct that pardons would be invalid if, in fact, as he has claimed, any pardons were signed by a staffer without Biden\u2019s knowledge or consent. But Trump has offered no evidence of that.\n\nTrump has repeatedly invoked the autopen issue in the last several days. As NPR explains, autopen is \u201ca generic name for a machine that duplicates signatures using real ink, making it easy for public figures to autograph everything from correspondence to merchandise in bulk. They are printer-sized machines with an arm that can hold a standard pen or pencil, and use it to replicate the programmed signature on a piece of paper below.\u201d Trump acknowledged that he himself uses an autopen, but \u201conly for very unimportant papers.\u201d\n\nIn a post to Truth Social on March 17, Trump claimed that some pardons issued by Biden were \u201chereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen.\u201d He specifically put members of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol on notice that \u201cthey are subject to investigation at the highest level.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s Late-Term Pardons\n\nOn Jan. 19, a day before he left office, Biden issued a series of preemptive pardons for members of Congress who served on the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack, staff of the committee and law enforcement officials who provided testimony to the committee. (Preemptive pardons are extended to people who have not been formally charged with a crime and are meant to shield them from potential prosecution.) That day, Biden also preemptively pardoned Gen. Mark Milley, Dr. Anthony Fauci and several of Biden\u2019s family members.\n\nBiden has used an autopen in the past, albeit rarely, according to a 2024 story that said staffers flew legislation to South Korea and St. Croix to ensure Biden could personally sign the bills. We could not independently confirm whether the pardons in question were signed via autopen.\n\nTrump has said that members of the Jan. 6 committee \u2014 including Rep. Bennie Thompson, who chaired the committee, and then-Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, Republicans on the committee \u2014 illegally \u201cdestroyed evidence and deleted everything\u201d and \u201cthey should be punished.\u201d (As we have written, claims that the committee destroyed \u201call the evidence\u201d are wrong.)\n\nBut legal scholars say there are several problems with Trump\u2019s claim that using an autopen would nullify these pardons. For starters, they say, presidents don\u2019t need to sign pardons for them to be official.\n\nArticle 2, Section 2, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution states that the president \u201cshall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States.\u201d It makes no mention of needing a signature to issue pardons, which stands in contrast to the Constitution\u2019s requirement that a president sign a bill in order to make it a law.\n\n\u201cNothing in the Constitution requires the president to sign pardons by hand,\u201d Jeffrey Crouch, a professor at American University and author of the book \u201cThe Presidential Pardon Power,\u201d told us via email.\n\nA 2024 ruling in a case before the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed. On the question of whether a signature is required for a president to exercise clemency, the court said, \u201cThe answer is undoubtedly no. The plain language of the Constitution imposes no such limit, broadly providing that the President \u2018shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.\u2019 \u2026 The constitutional text is thus silent as to any particular form the President\u2019s clemency act must take to be effective.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Crouch said, \u201cThe practice of using an autopen to sign presidential pardons seems perfectly legitimate.\u201d\n\nIndeed, other presidents have used an autopen. Former President Barack Obama was believed to be the first to use it to sign legislation in 2011 when, while in France, he used an autopen to extend the Patriot Act. Then-Rep. Tom Graves, a Republican, wrote Obama a letter asking him to confirm that the bill was \u201cpresented\u201d to him \u201cprior to the autopen signing.\u201d We couldn\u2019t find that the White House responded.\n\nA White House Legal Opinion\n\nKermit Roosevelt, a constitutional law professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, told us that the White House Office of Legal Counsel \u201chas opined, based on the original understanding of \u2018sign,\u2019 that the president can delegate the act of signing. So autopens are fine.\u201d\n\nIn 2005, the White House Office of Legal Counsel, at the request of then-President George W. Bush, looked into the issue. After a review of the Constitution and other legal opinions, it concluded \u201cthat the President need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become law. Rather, the President may sign a bill within the meaning of Article I, Section 7 by directing a subordinate to affix the President\u2019s signature to such a bill, for example by autopen.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe emphasize that we are not suggesting that the President may delegate the decision to approve and sign a bill, only that, having made this decision, he may direct a subordinate to affix the President\u2019s signature to the bill,\u201d Howard C. Nielson Jr., deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel, wrote in the legal opinion.\n\nAnd that gets to the second issue Trump raised: whether Biden was aware of or had instructed a subordinate to approve the pardons.\n\nIn a press conference on March 17, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \u201cThe president was begging the question that I think a lot of journalists in this room should be asking about whether or not the former president of the United States who I think we can all finally agree was cognitively impaired. \u2026 But the president was raising the point that did the president [Biden] even know about these pardons? Was his legal signature used without his consent or knowledge? \u2026 So I think it\u2019s a question that everybody in this room should be looking into because certainly that would propose perhaps criminal or illegal behavior if staff members were signing the president of the United States\u2019 autograph without his consent.\u201d\n\nIn interviews after his Truth Social post, Trump argued that Biden was \u201cgrossly incompetent\u201d and that pardons he signed in his final days in office were \u201cnull and void because I\u2019m sure Biden didn\u2019t have any idea that it was taking place.\u201d He acknowledged that ultimately, whether the pardons are illegitimate is \u201cnot my decision. That\u2019ll be up to court.\u201d\n\nHowever, neither Trump nor Leavitt has offered any evidence that Biden did not know about or approve the pardons.\n\n\u201cThe president can\u2019t delegate the decision of whether to sign, or whether to grant a pardon,\u201d Roosevelt said. \u201cA pardon granted without the president\u2019s knowledge is invalid. But there\u2019s no reason to think that\u2019s what happened here\u2014Biden spoke publicly about the pardons.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s Public Comments\n\nWhile we could not find that Biden spoke publicly about the Jan. 19 pardons after they were issued, he did share publicly, in the days preceding the pardons, that he was considering them.\n\nIn an interview on Jan. 5, for example, USA Today\u2019s Susan Page asked Biden, \u201cSome of your supporters have encouraged you to issue preemptive pardons to people like Liz Cheney and Anthony Fauci, who Trump has threatened to target. Will you do that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, a little bit of it depends on who he puts in what positions,\u201d Biden said. He said that in a post-election conversation with Trump, \u201cI tried to make it clear that there was no need, and it was counterintuitive for his interest to go back and try to settle scores.\u201d But Biden said Trump did not commit to that.\n\nAnd during remarks on Jan. 10, a reporter asked what pardons Biden was considering in his last 10 days in office.\n\n\u201cOne is that it depends on some of the language and expectations that Trump broadcasts in the last couple of days here as to what he\u2019s going to do,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe idea that he would punish people for not adhering to what he thinks should be policy as related to his well-being is outrageous, but there is still consideration of some folks, but no decision.\u201d\n\nThose comments are consistent with a Biden statement released by the White House on Jan. 20 explaining some of his 11th-hour pardons.\n\n\u201cOur nation relies on dedicated, selfless public servants every day. They are the lifeblood of our democracy,\u201d Biden stated. \u201cYet alarmingly, public servants have been subjected to ongoing threats and intimidation for faithfully discharging their duties.\n\n\u201cIn certain cases, some have even been threatened with criminal prosecutions, including General Mark A. Milley, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, and the members and staff of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThese public servants have served our nation with honor and distinction and do not deserve to be the targets of unjustified and politically motivated prosecutions.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Jan. 6 committee acted with \u201cintegrity and a commitment to discovering the truth,\u201d Biden said. \u201cRather than accept accountability, those who perpetrated the January 6th attack have taken every opportunity to undermine and intimidate those who participated in the Select Committee in an attempt to rewrite history, erase the stain of January 6th for partisan gain, and seek revenge, including by threatening criminal prosecutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven when individuals have done nothing wrong\u2014and in fact have done the right thing\u2014and will ultimately be exonerated, the mere fact of being investigated or prosecuted can irreparably damage reputations and finances,\u201d Biden stated, explaining that this was his reason for issuing the preemptive pardons. \u201cThe issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that any individual engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense.\u201d\n\nTrump can\u2019t simply revoke pardons issued by Biden, experts told us.\n\n\u201cA completed pardon is not able to be revoked,\u201d Crouch said. \u201cIf it was, then any sitting president could try to revoke pardons granted by their predecessors. A president who can undo the clemency decisions of their predecessors would weaken the clemency power for every president.\u201d",
